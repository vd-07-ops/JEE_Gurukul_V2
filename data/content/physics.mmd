## Chapter 1 Physical World

### 1 What is Physics?

Humans have always been curious about the world around them. The night sky with its bright celestial objects has fascinated humans since time immemorial. The regular repetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons, the eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always been a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety of materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour. The inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded to the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind of response from the earliest times has been to observe the physical environment carefully, look for any meaningful patterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and use new tools to interact with nature. This human endeavour led, in course of time, to modern science and technology.

The word **Science** originates from the Latin verb _Scientia_ meaning 'to know'. The Sanskrit word _Vijnan_ and the Arabic word _Ilm_ convey similar meaning, namely 'knowledge'. Science, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress. From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century, science had become a truly international enterprise, with many cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.

What is Science and what is the so-called **Scientific Method**? Science is a systematic attempt to understand natural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible, and use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and control phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and predicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn about the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first step towards the discovery of science. The scientific method involves several interconnected steps : Systematic observations, controlled experiments, qualitative andquantitative reasoning, mathematical modelling, prediction and verification or falsification of theories. Speculation and conjecture also have a place in science; but ultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable, must be verified by relevant observations or experiments. There is much philosophical debate about the nature and method of science that we need not discuss here.

The interplay of theory and observation (or experiment) is basic to the progress of science. Science is ever dynamic. There is no 'final' theory in science and no unquestioned authority among scientists. As observations improve in detail and precision or experiments yield new results, theories must account for them, if necessary, by introducing modifications. Sometimes the modifications may not be drastic and may lie within the framework of existing theory. For example, when Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) examined the extensive data on planetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in heliocentric theory (sun at the centre of the solar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543) had to be replaced by elliptical orbits to fit the data better. Occasionally, however, the existing theory is simply unable to explain new observations. This causes a major upheaval in science. In the beginning of the twentieth century, it was realised that Newtonian mechanics, till then a very successful theory, could not explain some of the most basic features of atomic phenomena. Similarly, the then accepted wave picture of light failed to explain the photoelectric effect properly. This led to the development of a radically new theory (_Quantum Mechanics_) to deal with atomic and molecular phenomena.

Just as a new experiment may suggest an alternative theoretical model, a theoretical advance may suggest what to look for in some experiments. The result of experiment of scattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) established the nuclear model of the atom, which then became the basis of the quantum theory of hydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr (1885-1962). On the other hand, the concept of antiparticle was first introduced theoretically by Paul Dirac (1902-1984) in 1930 and confirmed two years later by the experimental discovery of positron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.

Physics is a basic discipline in the category of **Natural Sciences**, which also includes other disciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word **Physics** comes from a Greek word meaning nature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is _Bhautiki_ that is used to refer to the study of the physical world. A precise definition of this discipline is neither possible nor necessary. We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena. The scope of physics is described briefly in the next section. Here we remark on two principal thrusts in physics : **unification** and **reduction**.

In Physics, we attempt to explain diverse physical phenomena _in terms of a few concepts and laws_. The effort is to see the physical world as manifestation of some universal laws in different domains and conditions. For example, the same law of gravitation (given by Newton) describes the fall of an apple to the ground, the motion of the moon around the earth and the motion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the basic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations) govern all electric and magnetic phenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental forces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same quest for unification.

A related effort is to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex, system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts. This approach is called **reductionism** and is at the heart of physics. For example, the subject of thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth century, deals with bulk systems in terms of macroscopic quantities such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, etc. Subsequently, the subjects of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics interpreted these quantities in terms of the properties of the molecular constituents of the bulk system. In particular, the temperature was seen to be related to the average kinetic energy of molecules of the system.

### **Scope and Excitement of Physics**

We can get some idea of the scope of physics by looking at its various sub-disciplines. Basically, there are two domains of interest : macroscopic and microscopic. The macroscopic domain includes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial and astronomical scales. The microscopic domain includes atomic, molecular and nuclear phenomena*. **Classical Physics** deals mainly with macroscopic phenomena and includes subjects like **Mechanics**, **Electrodynamics**, **Optics** and **Thermodynamics**. Mechanics founded on Newton's laws of motion and the law of gravitation is concerned with the motion (or equilibrium) of particles, rigid and deformable bodies, and general systems of particles. The propulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases, propagation of water waves or sound waves in air, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load, etc., are problems of mechanics. Electrodynamics deals with electric and magnetic phenomena associated with charged and magnetic bodies. Its basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted,

Footnote *: _Recently, the domain intermediate between the macroscopic and the microscopic (the so-called mesoscopic physics), dealing with a few tens or hundreds of atoms, has emerged as an exciting field of research._

Ampere and Faraday, and encapsulated by Maxwell in his famous set of equations. The motion of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field, the response of a circuit to an ac voltage (signal), the working of an antenna, the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, etc., are problems of electrodynamics. Optics deals with the phenomena involving light. The working of telescopes and microscopes, colours exhibited by thin films, etc., are topics in optics. Thermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does not deal with the motion of bodies as a whole. Rather, it deals with systems in macroscopic equilibrium and is concerned with changes in internal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the system through external work and transfer of heat. The efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators, the direction of a physical or chemical process, etc., are problems of interest in thermodynamics.

The microscopic domain of physics deals with the constitution and structure of matter at the minute scales of atoms and nuclei (and even lower scales of length) and their interaction with different probes such as electrons, photons and other elementary particles. Classical physics is inadequate to handle this domain and Quantum Theory is currently accepted as the proper framework for explaining microscopic phenomena. Overall, the edifice of physics is beautiful and imposing and you will appreciate it more as you pursue the subject.

You can now see that the scope of physics is truly vast. It covers a tremendous range of magnitude of physical quantities like length, mass, time, energy, etc. At one end, it studies phenomena at the very small scale of length (\(10^{\text{-14}}\,\text{m}\) or even less) involving electrons, protons, etc.; at the other end, it deals with astronomical phenomena at the scale of galaxies or even the entire universe whose extent is of the order of \(10^{26}\,\text{m}\). The two length scales differ by a factor of \(10^{40}\) or even more. The range of time scales can be obtained by dividing the length scales by the speed of light : \(10^{\text{-22}}\,\text{s}\) to \(10^{\text{-18}}\,\text{s}\). The range of masses goes from, say, \(10^{\text{-30}}\,\text{kg}\) (mass of an electron) to \(10^{\text{-55}}\,\text{kg}\) (mass of known observable universe). Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere in the middle of this range.

Figure 1: Theory and experiment go hand in hand in physics and help each other’s progress. The alpha scattering experiments of Rutherford gave the nuclear model of the atom.

Physics is exciting in many ways. To some people the excitement comes from the elegance and universality of its basic theories, from the fact that a few basic concepts and laws can explain phenomena covering a large range of magnitude of physical quantities. To some others, the challenge in carrying out imaginative new experiments to unlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute theories, is thrilling. Applied physics is equally demanding. Application and exploitation of physical laws to make useful devices is the most interesting and exciting part and requires great ingenuity and persistence of effort.

What lies behind the phenomenal progress of physics in the last few centuries? Great progress usually accompanies changes in our basic perceptions. First, it was realised that for scientific progress, only qualitative thinking, though no doubt important, is not enough. Quantitative measurement is central to the growth of science, especially physics, because the laws of nature happen to be expressible in precise mathematical equations. The second most important insight was that the basic laws of physics are universal -- the same laws apply in widely different contexts. Lastly, the strategy of approximation turned out to be very successful. Most observed phenomena in daily life are rather complicated manifestations of the basic laws. Scientists recognised the importance of extracting the essential features of a phenomenon from its less significant aspects. It is not practical to take into account all the complexities of a phenomenon in one go. A good strategy is to focus first on the essential features, discover the basic principles and then introduce corrections to build a more refined theory of the phenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather dropped from the same height do not reach the ground at the same time. The reason is that the essential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free fall under gravity, is complicated by the presence of air resistance. To get the law of free fall under gravity, it is better to create a situation wherein the air resistance is negligible. We can, for example, let the stone and the feather fall through a long evacuated tube. In that case, the two objects will fall almost at the same rate, giving the basic law that acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. With the basic law thus found, we can go back to the feather, introduce corrections due to air resistance, modify the existing theory and try to build a more realistic hypothesis, axioms and models

One should not think that everything can be proved with physics and mathematics. All physics, and also mathematics, is based on assumptions, each of which is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or postulate, etc.

For example, the universal law of gravitation proposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis, which he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him, there were several observations, experiments and data, on the motion of planets around the sun, motion of the moon around the earth, pendulums, bodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these required a separate explanation, which was more or less qualitative. What the universal law of gravitation says is that, _if we assume_ that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, then we can explain all these observations in one stroke. It not only explains these phenomena, it also allows us to predict the results of future experiments.

A hypothesis is a supposition without assuming that it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody to prove the universal law of gravitation, because it cannot be proved. It can be verified and substantiated by experiments and observations.

An axiom is a self-evident truth while a model is a theory proposed to explain observed phenomena. But you need not worry at this stage about the nuances in using these words. For example, next year you will learn about Bohr's model of hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an electron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules (postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large amount of spectroscopic data before him which no other theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we assume that an atom behaves in such a manner, we can explain all these things at once.

Einstein's special theory of relativity is also based on two postulates, the constancy of the speed of electromagnetic radiation and the validity of physical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It would not be wise to ask somebody to prove that the speed of light in vacuum is constant, independent of the source or observer.

In mathematics too, we need axioms and hypotheses at every stage. Euclid's statement that parallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means that if we assume this statement, we can explain several properties of straight lines and two or three dimensional figures made out of them. But if you don't assume it, you are free to use a different axiom and get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in the past few centuries and decades.

### Physics, Technology and Society

The connection between physics, technology and society can be seen in many examples. The discipline of thermodynamics arose from the need to understand and improve the working of heat engines. The steam engine, as we know, is inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in England in the eighteenth century, which had great impact on the course of human civilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to new physics; at other times physics generates new technology. An example of the latter is the wireless communication technology that followed the discovery of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism in the nineteenth century. The applications of physics are not always easy to foresee. As late as 1933, the great physicist Ernest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility of tapping energy from atoms. But only a few years later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner discovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced fission of uranium, which would serve as the basis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons. Yet another important example of physics giving rise to technology is the silicon 'chip' that triggered the computer revolution in the last three decades of the twentieth century.

A most significant area to which physics has and will contribute is the development of alternative energy resources. The fossil fuels of the planet are dwindling fast and there is an urgent need to discover new and affordable sources of energy. Considerable progress has already been made in this direction (for example, in conversion of solar energy, geothermal energy, etc., into electricity), but much more is still to be accomplished.

Table1.1 lists some of the great physicists, their major contribution and the country of origin. You will appreciate from this table the multi-cultural, international character of the scientific endeavour. Table 1.2 lists some important technologies and the principles of physics they are based on. Obviously, these tables are not exhaustive. We urge you to try to add many names and items to these tables with the help of your teachers, good books and websites on science. You will find that this exercise is very educative and also great fun. And, assuredly, it will never end. The progress of science is unstoppable!

Physics is the study of nature and natural phenomena. Physicists try to discover the rules that are operating in nature, on the basis of observations, experimentation and analysis. Physics deals with certain basic rules/laws governing the natural world. What is the nature

Table 1.1: Some physicists from different countries of the world and their major contributionsof physical laws? We shall now discuss the nature of fundamental forces and the laws that govern the diverse phenomena of the physical world.

### Fundamental forces in nature1
Footnote 1: _Sections 1.4 and 1.5 contain several ideas that you may not grasp fully in your first reading. However, we advise you to read them carefully to develop a feel for some basic aspects of physics. These are some of the areas which continue to occupy the physicists today._

We all have an intuitive notion of force. In our experience, force is needed to push, carry or throw objects, deform or break them. We also experience the impact of forces on us, like when a moving object hits us or we are in a merry-govound. Going from this intuitive notion to the proper scientific concept of force is not a trivial matter. Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong ideas about it. The correct notion of force was arrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of motion. He also gave an explicit form for the force for gravitational attraction between two bodies. We shall learn these matters in subsequent chapters.

In the macroscopic world, besides the gravitational force, we encounter several kinds of forces: muscular force, contact forces between bodies, friction (which is also a contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact), the forces exerted by compressed or elongated springs and taut strings and ropes (tension), the force of buoyancy and viscous force when solids are in contact with fluids, the force due to pressure of a fluid, the force due to surface tension of a liquid, and so on. There are also forces involving charged and magnetic bodies. In the microscopic domain again, we have electric and magnetic forces, nuclear forces involving protons and neutrons, interatomic and intermolecular forces, etc. We shall get familiar with some of these forces in later parts of this course.

A great insight of the twentieth century physics is that these different forces occurring in different contexts actually arise from only a small number of fundamental forces in nature. For example, the elastic spring force arises due to the net attraction/repulsion between the neighbouring atoms of the spring when the spring is elongated/compressed. This net attraction/repulsion can be traced to the (unbalanced) sum of electric forces between the charged constituents of the atoms.

In principle, this means that the laws for 'derived' forces (such as spring force, friction) are not independent of the laws of fundamental forces in nature. The origin of these derived forces is, however, very complex.

At the present stage of our understanding, we know of four fundamental forces in nature, which are described in brief here :

Table 1.2: Link between technology and physics 

#### 1.4.1 Gravitational Force

**The gravitational force is the force of mutual attraction between any two objects by virtue of their masses. It is a universal force. Every object experiences this force due to every other object in the universe. All objects on the earth, for example, experience the force of gravity due to the earth. In particular, gravity governs the motion of the moon and artificial satellites around the earth, motion of the earth and planets around the sun, and, of course, the motion of bodies falling to the earth. It plays a key role in the large-scale phenomena of the universe, such as formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and galactic clusters.**

#### 1.4.2 Electromagnetic Force

**Electromagnetic force is the force between charged particles. In the simpler case when charges are at rest, the force is given by Coulomb's law : attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges. Charges in motion produce magnetic effects and a magnetic field gives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric and magnetic effects are, in general, inseparable - hence the name electromagnetic force. Like the gravitational force, electromagnetic force acts over large distances and does not need any intervening medium. It is enormously strong compared to gravity. The electric force between two protons, for example, is \(10^{36}\) times the gravitational force between them, for any fixed distance.**

**Matter, as we know, consists of elementary charged constituents like electrons and protons. Since the electromagnetic force is so much stronger than the gravitational force, it dominates all phenomena at atomic and molecular scales. (The other two forces, as we shall see, operate only at nuclear scales.) Thus it is mainly the electromagnetic force that governs the structure of atoms and molecules, the dynamics of chemical reactions and the mechanical, thermal and other properties of materials. It underlies the macroscopic forces like 'tension', 'friction', 'normal force','spring force', etc.**

**Gravity is always attractive, while electromagnetic force can be attractive or repulsive. Another way of putting it is that mass comes only in one variety (there is no negative mass), but charge comes in two varieties : positive and negative charge. This is what makes all the difference. Matter is mostly electrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus, electric force is largely zero and gravitational force dominates terrestrial phenomena. Electric force manifests itself in atmosphere where the atoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.**

**If we reflect a little, the enormous strength of the electromagnetic force compared to gravity is evident in our daily life. When we hold a book in our hand, we are balancing the gravitational force on the book due to the huge mass of the earth by the 'normal force' provided by our hand. The latter is nothing but the net electromagnetic force between the charged constituents of our hand and the book, at the surface in contact. If electromagnetic force were not intrinsically so much stronger than gravity, the hand of the strongest man would crumble under the weight of a feather! Indeed, to be consistent, in that circumstance, we ourselves would crumble under our own weight!**

#### Strong Nuclear Force

**The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons in a nucleus. It is evident that without some attractive force, a nucleus will be unstable due to the electric repulsion between its protons. This attractive force cannot be gravitational since force of gravity is negligible compared to the electric force. A new basic force must, therefore, be invoked. The strong nuclear force is the strongest of all fundamental forces, about 100 times the electromagnetic force in strength. It is charge-independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. Its range is, however, extremely small, of about nuclear dimensions (10\({}^{-15}\)m). It is responsible for the stability of nuclei. The electron, it must be noted, does not experience this force.**

**Recent developments have, however, indicated that protons and neutrons are built out of still more elementary constituents called quarks.**

#### Weak Nuclear Force

**The weak nuclear force appears only in certain nuclear processes such as the** \(\beta\)**-decay of a nucleus. In** \(\beta\)**-decay, the nucleus emits an electron and an uncharged particle called neutrino. The weak nuclear force is not as weak as the gravitational force, but much weaker than the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces. The range of weak nuclear force is exceedingly small, of the order of 10**-**16**m.**

#### Towards Unification of Forces

**We remarked in section** 1.1 **that unification is a basic quest in physics. Great advances in physics often amount to unification of differenttheories and domains. Newton unified terrestrial and celestial domains under a common law of gravitation. The experimental discoveries of Oersted and Faraday showed that electric and magnetic phenomena are in general inseparable. Maxwell unified electromagnetism and optics with the discovery that light is an electromagnetic wave. Einstein attempted to unify gravity and electromagnetism but could not succeed in this venture. But this did not deter physicists from zealously pursuing the goal of unification of forces.

Recent decades have seen much progress on this front. The electromagnetic and the weak nuclear force have now been unified and are seen as aspects of a single 'electro-weak' force. What this unification actually means cannot be explained here. Attempts have been (and are being) made to unify the electro-weak and the strong force and even to unify the gravitational force with the rest of the fundamental forces. Many of these ideas are still speculative and inconclusive. Table 4 summarises some of the milestones in the progress towards unification of forces in nature.

### Nature of Physical Laws

Physicists explore the universe. Their investigations, based on scientific processes, range from particles that are smaller than atoms in size to stars that are very far away. In addition to finding the facts by observation and experimentation, physicists attempt to discover the laws that summarise (often as mathematical equations) these facts.

In any physical phenomenon governed by different forces, several quantities may change with time. A remarkable fact is that some special physical quantities, however, remain constant in time. They are the conserved quantities of nature. Understanding these conservation principles is very important to describe the observed phenomena quantitatively.

For motion under an external conservative force, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum of kinetic and potential energy of a body is a constant. The familiar example is the free fall of an object under gravity. Both the kinetic energy of the object and its potential energy change continuously with time, but the sum remains fixed. If the object is released from rest, the initial

\end{table}
Table 4: Progress in unification of different forces/domains in nature potential energy is completely converted into the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the ground. This law restricted for a conservative force should not be confused with the general law of conservation of energy of an isolated system (which is the basis of the First Law of Thermodynamics).

The concept of energy is central to physics and the expressions for energy can be written for every physical system. When all forms of energy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical energy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy is conserved. The general law of conservation of energy is true for all forces and for any kind of transformation between different forms of energy. In the falling object example, if you include the effect of air resistance during the fall and see the situation after the object hits the ground and stays there, the total mechanical energy is obviously not conserved. The general law of energy conservation, however, is still applicable. The initial potential energy of the stone gets transformed into other forms of energy : heat and sound. (Ultimately, sound after it is absorbed becomes heat.) The total energy of the system (stone plus the surroundings) remains unchanged.

The law of conservation of energy is thought to be valid across all domains of nature, from the microscopic to the macroscopic. It is routinely applied in the analysis of atomic, nuclear and elementary particle processes. At the other end, all kinds of violent phenomena occur in the universe all the time. Yet the total energy of the universe (the most ideal isolated system possible!) is believed to remain unchanged.

Until the advent of Einstein's theory of relativity, the law of conservation of mass was regarded as another basic conservation law of nature, since matter was thought to be indestructible. It was (and still is) an important principle used, for example, in the analysis of chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms among different molecules. If the total binding energy of the reacting molecules is less than the total binding energy of the product molecules, the difference appears as heat and the reaction is exothermic. The opposite is true for energy absorbing (endothermic) reactions. However, since the atoms are merely rearranged but not destroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the same as the total mass of the products in a chemical reaction. The changes in the binding energy are too small to be measured as changes in mass.

According to Einstein's theory, mass m is equivalent to energy E given by the relation E= mc\({}^{2}\), where c is speed of light in vacuum.

In a nuclear process mass gets converted to energy (or vice-versa). This is the energy which is released in a nuclear power generation and nuclear explosions.

Energy is a scalar quantity. But all conserved quantities are not necessarily scalars. The total linear momentum and the total angular momentum (both vectors) of an isolated system are also conserved quantities. These laws can be derived from Newton's laws of motion in mechanics. But their validity goes beyond mechanics. They are the basic conservation laws of nature in all domains, even in those where Newton's laws may not be valid.

Besides their great simplicity and generality, the conservation laws of nature are very useful in practice too. It often happens that we cannot solve the full dynamics of a complex problem involving different particles and forces. The conservation laws can still provide useful results. For example, we may not know the complicated forces that act during a collision of two automobiles; yet momentum conservation law enables us to bypass the complications and predict or rule out possible outcomes of the collision. In nuclear and elementary particle phenomena also, the conservation laws are important tools of analysis. Indeed, using the conservation laws of energy and momentum for \(\beta\)-decay, Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) correctly predicted in 1931 the existence of a new particle (now called neutrino) emitted in \(\beta\)-decay along with the electron.

Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature that you will explore in more advanced courses in physics. For example, an important observation is that the laws of nature do not change with time! If you perform an experiment in your laboratory today and repeat the same experiment (on the same objects under identical conditions) after a year, the results are bound to be the same. It turns out that this symmetry of nature with respect to translation (i.e. displacement) in time is equivalent to the law of conservation of energy. Likewise, space is homogeneous and there is no (intrinsically) preferred location in the universe. To put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the same everywhere in the universe. (Caution : the phenomena may differ from place to place because of differing conditions at different locations. For example, the acceleration due to gravity at the moon is one-sixth that at the earth, but the law of gravitation is the same both on the moon and the earth.) This symmetry of the laws of nature with respect to translation in space gives rise to conservation of linear momentum. In the same way isotropy of space (no intrinsically preferred direction in space) underlies the law of conservation of angular momentum*. The conservation laws of charge and other attributes of elementary particles can also be related to certain abstract symmetries. Symmetries of space and time and other abstract symmetries play a central role in modern theories of fundamental forces in nature.

Summary

1. Physics deals with the study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different phenomena. The basic laws of physics are universal and apply in widely different contexts and conditions.
2. The scope of physics is wide, covering a tremendous range of magnitude of physical quantities.
3. Physics and technology are related to each other. Sometimes technology gives rise to new physics; at other times physics generates new technology. Both have direct impact on society.
4. There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the macroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the 'gravitational force', the 'electromagnetic force', the'strong nuclear force', and the 'weak nuclear force'. Unification of different forces/domains in nature is a basic quest in physics.
5. The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved quantities. Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of conservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity, etc. Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.
6. Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature. Symmetries of space and time, and other types of symmetries play a central role in modern theories of fundamental forces in nature.

_Note for the teacher_

The exercises given here are not for the purpose of a formal examination.

1.1 Some of the most profound statements on the nature of science have come from Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time. What do you think did Einstein mean when he said : "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible"?
1.2 "Every great physical theory starts as a heresy and ends as a dogma". Give some examples from the history of science of the validity of this incisive remark.
1.3 "Politics is the art of the possible". Similarly, "Science is the art of the soluble". Explain this beautiful aphorism on the nature and practice of science.
1.4 Though India now has a large base in science and technology, which is fast expanding, it is still a long way from realising its potential of becoming a world leader in science. Name some important factors, which in your view have hindered the advancement of science in India.
1.5 No physicist has ever "seen" an electron. Yet, all physicists believe in the existence of electrons. An intelligent but superstitious man advances this analogy to argue that 'ghosts' exist even though no one has'seen' one. How will you refute his argument?
1.6 The shells of crabs found around a particular coastal location in Japan seem mostly to resemble the legendary face of a Samurai. Given below are two explanations of this observed fact. Which of these strikes you as a scientific explanation? (a) A tragic sea accident several centuries ago drowned a young Samurai. As a tribute to his bravery, nature through its inscrutable ways immortalised his face by imprinting it on the crab shells in that area.

* After the sea tragedy, fishermen in that area, in a gesture of honour to their dead hero, let free any crab shell caught by them which accidentally had a shape resembling the face of a Samurai. Consequently, the particular shape of the crab shell survived longer and therefore in course of time the shape was genetically propagated. This is an example of evolution by artificial selection. [Note : This interesting illustration taken from Carl Sagan's 'The Cosmos' highlights the fact that often strange and inexplicable facts which on the first sight appear'supernatural' actually turn out to have simple scientific explanations. Try to think out other examples of this kind].
* The industrial revolution in England and Western Europe more than two centuries ago was triggered by some key scientific and technological advances. What were these advances?
* It is often said that the world is witnessing now a second industrial revolution, which will transform the society as radically as did the first. List some key contemporary areas of science and technology, which are responsible for this revolution.
* Write in about 1000 words a fiction piece based on your speculation on the science and technology of the twenty-second century.
* Attempt to formulate your'moral' views on the practice of science. Imagine yourself stumbling upon a discovery, which has great academic interest but is certain to have nothing but dangerous consequences for the human society. How, if at all, will you resolve your dilemma?
* Science, like any knowledge, can be put to good or bad use, depending on the user. Given below are some of the applications of science. Formulate your views on whether the particular application is good, bad or something that cannot be so clearly categorised : (a) Mass vaccination against small pox to curb and finally eradicate this disease from the population. (This has already been successfully done in India). (b) Television for eradication of illiteracy and for mass communication of news and ideas. (c) Prenatal sex determination (d) Computers for increase in work efficiency (e) Putting artificial satellites into orbits around the Earth (f ) Development of nuclear weapons (g) Development of new and powerful techniques of chemical and biological warfare). (h) Purification of water for drinking (i) Plastic surgery (j ) Cloning
* India has had a long and unbroken tradition of great scholarship -- in mathematics, astronomy, linguistics, logic and ethics. Yet, in parallel with this, several superstitious and obscurantisc attitudes and practices flourished in our society and unfortunately continue even today -- among many educated people too. How will you use your knowledge of science to develop strategies to counter these attitudes?
* Though the law gives women equal status in India, many people hold unscientific views on a woman's innate nature, capacity and intelligence, and in practice give them a secondary status and role. Demolish this view using scientific arguments, and by quoting examples of great women in science and other spheres; and persuade yourself and others that, given equal opportunity, women are on par with men.
* It is more important to have beauty in the equations of physics than to have them agree with experiments". The great British physicist P. A. M. Dirac held this view. Criticize this statement. Look out for some equations and results in this book which strike you as beautiful.
* Though the statement quoted above may be disputed, most physicists do have a feeling that the great laws of physics are at once simple and beautiful. Some of the notable physicists, besides Dirac, who have articulated this feeling, are : Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Chandrasekhar and Feynman. You are urged to make special efforts to get access to the general books and writings by these and other great masters of physics. (See the Bibliography at the end of this book.) Their writings are truly inspiring!

1.16 Textbooks on science may give you a wrong impression that studying science is dry and all too serious and that scientists are absent-minded introverts who never laugh or grin. This image of science and scientists is patently false. Scientists, like any other group of humans, have their share of humorists, and many have led their lives with a great sense of fun and adventure, even as they seriously pursued their scientific work. Two great physicists of this genre are Gamow and Feynman. You will enjoy reading their books listed in the Bibliography.

## Chapter 1 Units and Measurement

### 1 Introduction

Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called **unit.** The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are interrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called **fundamental** or **base units**. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called **derived units.** A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the **system of units**.

### 1 The INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently.

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows :

In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively.

In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively.

In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively.

The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the _Systeme Internationale d'Unites_ (French for International System of Units). abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971 forinternational usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work. Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in this book.

In SI, there are seven base units as given in Table 2.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more units that are defined for (a) plane angle d\(\theta\) as the ratio of length of arc ds to the radius \(r\) and (b) solid angle d\(\Omega\) as the ratio of the intercepted area d\(A\) of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the centre, to the square of its radius \(r\), as shown in Fig. 2.1(a) and (b) respectively. The unit for plane angle is rad in an with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are dimensionless quantities.

The values mentioned here need not be remembered \(\alpha\) asked in a test. They are given here only to indicate the extent of accuracy to \(u\) which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep \(up\) with this progress.

Note that when mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified. These entities may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles or specified groups of such particles.

We employ units for some physical quantities that can be derived from the seven base units (Appendix A.6). Some derived units in terms of the SI base units are given in (Appendix A.6.1). Some SI derived units are given special names (Appendix A.6.2) and some derived SI units make use of these units with special names and the seven base units (Appendix A.6.3). These are given in Appendix A.6.2 and A.6.3 for your ready reference. Other units retained for general use are given in Table 2.2.

Common SI prefixes and symbols for multiples and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A.2. General guidelines for using symbols for physical quantities, chemical elements and nuclides are given in Appendix A.7 and those for SI units and some other units are given in Appendix A.8 for your guidance and ready reference.

### Measurement of Length

You are already familiar with some direct methods for the measurement of length. For example, a metre scale is used for lengths from \(10^{-3}\) m to \(10^{2}\) m. A vernier callpers is used for lengths to an accuracy of \(10^{-4}\) m. A screw gauge and a spherometer can be used to measure lengths as less as to \(10^{-5}\) m. To measure lengths beyond these ranges, we make use of some special indirect methods.

#### Measurement of Large Distances

Large distances such as the distance of a planet or a star from the earth cannot be measured directly with a metre scale. An important method in such cases is the **parallax m ethod**.

When you hold a pencil in front of you against some specific point on the background (a wall) and look at the pencil first through your left eye. A (closing the right eye) and then look at the pencil through your right eye B (closing the left eye), you would notice that the position of the pencil seems to change with respect to the point on the wall. This is called **parallax**. The distance between the two points of observation is called the **basis**. In this example, the basis is the distance between the eyes.

To measure the distance \(D\) of a far away planet S by the parallax method, we observe it from two different positions (observatories) A and B on the Earth, separated by distance AB = \(b\) at the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2. We measure the angle between the two directions along which the planet is viewed at these two points. The \(\angle\)AB in Fig. 2.2 represented by symbol \(\theta\) is called the **parallax angle** or **parallactic angle**.

As the planet is very far away, \(\frac{b}{D}<<1\), and therefore, \(\theta\) is very small. Then we approximately take AB as an arc of length \(b\) of a circle with centre at S and the distance \(D\) as

#### Range of Lengths

The sizes of the objects we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range. These may vary from the size of the order of 10\({}^{\text{-14}}\) m of the tiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order of 10\({}^{\text{ag}}\) m of the extent of the observable universe. Table 2.6 gives the range and order of lengths and sizes of some of these objects.

We also use certain special length units for short and large lengths. These are

1 fermi = 1 f = 10\({}^{\text{-15}}\) m

1 angstrom = 1 A = 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) m

1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance of the Sun from the Earth) = 1.496 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\text{-11}}\) m

1 light year = 1 ly = 9.46 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\text{-11}}\) m (distance that light travels with velocity of 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\text{8}}\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) in 1 year)

1 parsec = 3.08 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\text{-16}}\) m (Parsec is the distance at which average radius of earth's orbit subtends an angle of 1 arc second)

### Measurement of Mass

Mass is a basic property of matter. It does not depend on the temperature, pressure or location of the object in space. The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg). The prototypes of the International standard kilogram supplied by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) are available in many other laboratories of different countries. In India, this is available at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi.

While dealing with atoms and molecules, the kilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case, there is an important standard unit of mass, called the **unified atomic mass unit** (u), which has been established for expressing the mass of atoms as

1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u

 = (1/12) of the mass of an atom of carbon-12 isotope \(\left[{}^{12}_{6}\text{C}\right]\) including the mass of electrons = 1.66 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\text{-27}}\) kg

Mass of commonly available objects can be determined by a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop. Large masses in the universe like planets, stars, etc., based on Newton's law of gravitation can be measured by using gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For measurement of small masses of atomic/subatomic particles etc., we make use of mass spectrograph in which radius of the trajectory is proportional to the mass of a charged particle moving in uniform electric and magnetic field.

#### Range of Masses

The masses of the objects, we come across in the universe, vary over a very wide range. These may vary from tiny mass of the order of 10\({}^{\text{-30}}\) kg of an electron to the huge mass of about 10\({}^{\text{-30}}\) kg of the known universe. Table 2.4 gives the range and order of the typical masses of various objects.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Gree Coperate moves} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Perpet M(C)} \\ \hline Size of a proton & 10\({}^{\text{-15}}\) \\ Size of atomic nucleus & 10\({}^{\text{-14}}\) \\ Size of hydrogen atom & 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) \\ Length of typical virus & 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) \\ Wavelength of light & 10\({}^{\text{7}}\) \\ Size of red blood corpuscle & 10\({}^{\text{-5}}\) \\ Thickness of a paper & 10\({}^{\text{-4}}\) \\ Height of the Mount Everest above sea level & 10\({}^{\text{-4}}\) \\ Radius of the Earth & 10\({}^{\text{7}}\) \\ Distance of moon from the Earth & 10\({}^{\text{-8}}\) \\ Distance of the Sun from the Earth & 10\({}^{\text{-11}}\) \\ Distance of Pluto from the Sun & 10\({}^{\text{-13}}\) \\ Size of our galaxy & 10\({}^{\text{-71}}\) \\ Distance to Andromeda galaxy & 10\({}^{\text{-22}}\) \\ Distance to the boundary of observable universe & 10\({}^{\text{-6}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.3 Range and order of lengths

### Measurement of time

To measure any time interval we need a clock. We now use an **atomic standard of time**, which is based on the periodic vibrations produced in a cesium atom. This is the basis of the **cesium clock**, sometimes called **atomic clock**, used in the national standards. Such standards are available in many laboratories. In the cesium atomic clock, the second is taken as the time needed for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium-133 atom. The vibrations of the cesium atom regulate the rate of this cesium atomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance wheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the vibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a quartz wristwatch.

The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate. In principle they provide portable standard. The national standard of time interval'second' as well as the frequency is maintained through four cesium atomic clocks. A cesium atomic clock is used at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi to maintain the Indian standard of time.

In our country, the NPL has the responsibility of maintenance and improvement of physical standards, including that of time, frequency, etc. Note that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is linked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient cesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they impart the uncertainty in time realisation as \(\pm 1\times 10^{-13}\), i.e. 1 part in \(10^{13}\). This implies that the uncertainty gained over time by such a device is less than 1 part in \(10^{13}\); they lose or gain no more than 3 us in one year. In view of the tremendous accuracy in time measurement, the SI unit of length has been expressed in terms the path length light travels in certain interval of time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 1).

The time interval of events that we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range. Table 1 gives the range and order of some typical time intervals.

You may notice that there is an interesting coincidence between the numbers appearing in Tables 1 and 1. Note that the ratio of the longest and shortest lengths of objects in our universe is about \(10^{+1}\). Interestingly enough, the ratio of the longest and shortest time intervals associated with the events and objects in our universe is also about \(10^{+1}\). This number, \(10^{+1}\) comes up again in Table 1, which lists typical masses of objects. The ratio of the largest and smallest masses of the objects in our universe is about \((10^{+1})\). Is this a curious coincidence between these large numbers purely accidental?

### Accuracy, precision of instruments and errors in measurement

Measurements the foundation of all experimental science and technology. The result of every measurement by any measuring instrument contains some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called **error**. Every calculated quantity which is based on measured values, also has an error. We shall distinguish between two terms: **accuracy** and **precision**. The accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how close the measured value is to the true value of the quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution or limit the quantity is measured.

The accuracy in measurement may depend on several factors, including the limit or the resolution of the measuringinstrument. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm. In one experiment, using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, the measured value is found to be 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm, the length is determined to be 3.38 cm. The first measurement has more accuracy (because it is

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline CPBR & True (T) \\ \hline Electron & 10-20 \\ \hline Proton & 10-27 \\ \hline Uranium atom & 10-25 \\ \hline Red blood cell & 10-13 \\ \hline Dust particle & 10-9 \\ \hline Rain drop & 10-6 \\ \hline Mosquito & 10-5 \\ \hline Grape & 10-3 \\ \hline Human & 102 \\ \hline Automobile & 103 \\ \hline Boeing 747 aircraft & 108 \\ \hline Moon & 1023 \\ \hline Earth & 1025 \\ \hline Sun & 1030 \\ \hline Milky way galaxy & 1041 \\ \hline Observable Universe & 1055 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Range and order of massescloser to the true value) but less precision (its resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise. Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors.

_Systematic errors_

The **systematic errors** are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative. Some of the sources of systematic errors are :

1. Instrumental errors that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the measuring instrument. zero error in the instrument. etc. For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately calibrated (it may read 1 04 \({}^{\circ}\)C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas it should read 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C); in a vernier callpers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale. or simply an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end.
2. Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure To determine the temperature of a human body. a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement.
3. Personal errors that arise due to an individual's blas. lack of proper setting of the apparatus or individual's carelessness in taking observations without observing proper precautions, etc. For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the right while reading the position of a needle on the scale. you will introduce an error due to parallax.

**Systematic errors** can be minimised by improving experimental techniques. selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible. For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings.

_Randomerrors_

The **random errors** are those errors. which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect

How will you measure the length of a line? What a naive question, at this stage, you might say But what if it is not a straight line? Draw a zigzag line in your copy, oron the blackboard. Well, not to do difficult again. You might take a thread, place it along the line, open up the thread, and measure its length.

Now imagine that you want to measure the length of a national highway, a river, the railway track between two stations, or the boundary between two states or two nations. If you take a string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it along the line, shift its position every time, the arithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses on the project is not commensurate with the outcome. Moreover, errors are bound to occur in this enormous task. There is an interesting fact about this, France and Belgium share a common interfmental boundary, whose length mentioned in the official documents of the two countries differs substantially!

Go one step beyond and imagine the coastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers have fairly mild bends as compared to a coastline, Evenso, all documents, including our school books, contain information on the length of the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh, or the common boundary between two states, etc. Railway tickets come with the distance between stations printed on them. We have'milestones' all along the roads indicating the distances to various towns, So, how is it done?

One has to decide how much error one can tolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you want smaller errors, it will involve high technology and high costs. Suffice it to say that it requires fairly advanced level of physics, mathematics, engineering and technology. It belongs to the areas of fractals, which has lately become popular in theoretical physics. Even then one doesn't know how much to rely on the figure that props up, as is clear from the story of France and Belgium, Incidentally, this story of the France-Belgium discrepancy appears on the first page of an advanced Physics book on the subject of fractals and chaos!

**density is the ratio of the mass to the volume of the substance. If we have errors in the measurement of mass and of the sizes or dimensions, we must know what the error will be in the density of the substance. To make such estimates, we should learn how errors combine in various mathematical operations. For this, we use the following procedure.**

**(a)** _Error of a sum or a difference_

Suppose two physical quantities \(A\) and \(B\) have measured values \(A\pm\Delta A\), \(B\pm\Delta B\) respectively where \(\Delta A\) and \(\Delta B\) are their absolute errors. We wish to find the error \(\Delta Z\)in the sum

\(Z=A+B\).

We have by addition, \(Z\pm\Delta Z\)

\(=\{A\pm\Delta A\}+\{B\pm\Delta B\}\).

The maximum possible error in \(Z\)

\(\Delta Z=\Delta A+\Delta B\)

For the difference \(Z=A-B\), we have

\(Z\pm\Delta Z=\)\((A\pm\Delta A)-(B\pm\Delta B)\)

\(=(A-B)\pm\Delta A\pm\Delta B\)

**or, \(\pm\Delta Z=\pm\Delta A\pm\Delta B\)**

The maximum value of the error \(\Delta Z\) is again \(\Delta A+\Delta B\).

**Hence the rule : When two quantities are added or subtracted, the absolute error in the final result is the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities.**

**Example 2.8**: The temperatures of two bodies measured by a thermometer are

\(t_{i}=20\,^{0}C\pm 0.5\,^{0}C\) and \(t_{2}=50\,^{0}C\pm 0.5\,^{0}C\). Calculate the temperature difference and the error theirin.

_Answer \(t^{\prime}=t_{2}-t_{i}=(50\,^{0}C\pm 0.5\,^{0}C)-(20\,^{0}C\pm 0.5\,^{0}C)\)_

\(t^{\prime}=30\,^{0}C\pm 1\,^{0}C\)\(\ll\)

**(b)**  Error of a product or a quotient

Suppose \(Z=AB\) and the measured values of \(A\) and \(B\) are \(A\pm\Delta A\) and \(B\pm\Delta B\). Then

\(Z\pm\Delta Z=\)\((A\pm\Delta A)\)\((B\pm\Delta B)\)

\(=AB\pm B\)\(\Delta A\pm A\)\(\Delta B\pm\Delta A\)\(\Delta B\).

Dividing LHS by \(Z\)and RHS by \(AB\) we have,

\(1\pm\{\Delta Z/Z\}=1\pm\{\Delta A/A\}\pm(\Delta B/B)\pm\{\Delta A/A\}(\Delta B/B)\).

Since \(\Delta A\) and \(\Delta B\) are small, we shall ignore their product.

Hence the maximum relative error

\(\Delta Z/Z=\{\Delta A/A\}+\{\Delta B/B\}\).

You can easily verify that this is true for division also.

**Hence the rule : When two quantities are multiplied or divided, the relative error in the result is the sum of the relative errors in the multipliers.**

the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superfluous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement.

The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. **A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement.** This important remark makes most of the following observations clear:

(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 \(\upmu\)m.

All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four. This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures.

The example gives the following rules :

* **All the non-zero digits are significant.**
* **All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.**
* **If the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant.** [In 0.00 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant].
* **The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant.** [Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has _three_ significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation.
* **The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant.** [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.]

(2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose we change units, then

4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km

Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has _two_ significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures.

(3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as \(a\times 10^{b}\), where \(a\) is a number between 1 and 10, and \(b\) is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number \(a\) to 1 (for \(a\)\(\leq\) 5) and to 10 (for 5\(<\)\(a\)\(\leq\) 10). Then the number can be expressed approximately as \(10^{b}\) in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called **order of magnitude** of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of \(10^{b}\). For example, the diameter of the earth (1.28\(\times\)10\({}^{7}\)m) is of the order of \(10^{7}\)m with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom (1.06 \(\times\)10\({}^{-10}\)m) is of the order of \(10^{-10}\)m, with the order of magnitude -10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.

It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears :

4.700 m = 4.700 \(\times\) 10\({}^{2}\) cm

= 4.700 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) mm = 4.700 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) km

The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has _four_ significant figures.

Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number \(a\). They are always significant.

(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example :

* **For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant.**
* **For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant.**

(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement.

(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in \(r\)=\(\dfrac{d}{2}\) or s = 2\(\pi\), the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in \(T\)=\(\dfrac{t}{n}\), \(n\) is an exact number.

#### 2.7.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Significant Figures

The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant figures) must reflect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be 2.51 cm\({}^{3}\), then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 g/cm\({}^{3}\) upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with significant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values :

(1) **In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures.**

Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to _three_ significant figures.

Density = \(\dfrac{4.237\text{g}}{2.51\text{ cm}^{3}}\) = 1.69 g cm\({}^{-3}\)

Similarly, if the speed of light is given as 3.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\) (_three_ significant figures) and one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 \(\times\) 10\({}^{7}\) s (_five_ significant figures), the light year is 9.47 \(\times\) 10\({}^{15}\) m (_three_ significant figures).

(2) **In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places.**

For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g.

Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as :

0.307 m - 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) m.

Note that we should not use the _rule_ (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of **addition** and 3.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) m in the example of **subtraction**. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places.

#### 2.7.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits

The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would be 2.74. The _rule_ by convention is that the **preceding digit is raised by 1 if the 

**insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5**. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that **if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1**. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 2.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 2.74 since the preceding digit is odd.

In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps. one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures. such as in 2.99792458 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\) m/s for the speed of light in vacuum. is rounded off to an approximate value 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\) m/s. which is often employed in computations. Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulaelike 2 \(\pi\) in \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\), have a large (infinite) number of significant figures. The value of \(\pi\) = 3.1415926,..., is known to a large number of significant figures. You may take the value as 3.142 or 3.14 for \(\pi\), with limited number of significant figures as required in specific cases.**

**Example 2.13**: Each side of a cube is measured to be 7.203 m. What are the total surface area and the volume of the cube to appropriate signifcant figures?

_Answer_ **The number of significant figures in the measured length is 4. The calculated area and the volume should therefore be rounded off to 4 significant figures.**

**Surface area of the cube = 6(7.203)\({}^{2}\) m\({}^{2}\)**

= 311.299254 m\({}^{2}\)**

= 311.3 m\({}^{2}\)**

Volume of the cube = (7.203)\({}^{2}\) m\({}^{2}\)**

= 373.714754 m\({}^{3}\)**

= 373.7 m\({}^{2}\)**

**Example 2.14**: 5.74 g of a substance occupies 1.2 cm\({}^{3}\). Express its density by keeping the significant figures in view.

_Answer_ **There are 3 significant figures in the measured mass whereas there are only 2 significant figures in the measured volume. Hence the density should be expressed to only 2 significant figures.**

**Density = \(\frac{5.74}{1.2}\) g cm\({}^{3}\)**

= 4.8 g cm\({}^{-3}\)**

#### 2.7.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty in the Results of Arithmetic Calculations

The rules for determining the uncertainty or error in the number/measured quantity in arithmetic operations can be understood from the following examples.

(1) If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement. It means that the length \(l\) may be written as

\[l = 16.2\pm 0.1\ \mathrm{cm}\] \[= 16.2\ \mathrm{cm}\pm 0.6\ \mathrm{\%}.\]

Similarly, the breadth \(b\) may be written as

\[b = 10.1\ \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{cm}\] \[= 10.1\ \mathrm{cm}\pm 1\ \mathrm{\%}\]

Then, the error of the product of two (or more) experimental values, using the combination of errors rule. will be

\[l b = 163.62\ \mathrm{cm}^{2}\pm 1.6\%\] \[= 163.62\pm 2.6\ \mathrm{cm}^{2}\]

This leads us to quote the final result as

\[l b = 164\pm 3\ \mathrm{cm}^{2}\]

Here 3 cm\({}^{2}\) is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet.

(2) **If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures.**

However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced.

For example, 12.9 g - 7.06 g, both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted).

(3) **The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself.**

For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is \(\pm\) 0.01 g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to \(\pm\) 0.01 g. The relative error in 1.02 g is

\(=(\pm\) 0.01/1.02)\(\times\) 100 %

\(=\pm\) 1%

Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is

\(=(\pm\) 0.01/9.89)\(\times\) 100 %

\(=\pm\) 0.1 %

Finally, remember that **intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement.** These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58.

This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers.

### Dimensions of physical quantities

The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. **The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity.** Note that using the square brackets [ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with **'the dimensions of** the quantity.

In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] \(\times\) [L] \(\times\) [L] = [L]\({}^{3}\) = [L]\({}^{3}\). As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M\({}^{3}\)], zero dimension in time [T\({}^{3}\)] and three dimensions in length.

Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as

\(\text{Force = mass }\times\text{acceleration}\)

\(=\text{mass }\times\text{(length)}/\text{(time)}^{2}\)

The dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]\({}^{2}\) = [M L T\({}^{2}\)]. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and -2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero.

Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, final velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T\({}^{\sim}\)].

### Dimensional Formula and Dimensional Equations

The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the _dimensional formula_ of the given physical quantity. For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is [M\({}^{3}\) L\({}^{3}\) T\({}^{3}\)], and that of speed or velocity is [M\({}^{3}\) L T\({}^{3}\)]. Similarly, [M\({}^{3}\) L T\({}^{3}\)] is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M L\({}^{3}\) T\({}^{3}\)] that of mass density.

An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the **dimensional equation** of the physical quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities. For example, the dimensional equations of volume \([V]\), speed \([v]\), force \([F]\) and mass density \([\rho]\) may be expressed as

\[\begin{array}{l}[V]=[M^{0}\ L^{3}\ T^{0}]\\ [v]=[M^{0}\ L\ T^{-1}]\\ [F]=[M\ L\ T^{2}]\\ [\rho]=[M\ L^{3}\ T^{0}]\end{array}\]

The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities. The dimensional formulae of a large number and wide variety of physical quantities, derived from the equations representing the relationships among other physical quantities and expressed in terms of base quantities are given in Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready reference.

### Dimensional Analysis and Its Applications

The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which guide the description of physical behaviour is of basic importance as only those physical quantities can be added or subtracted which have the same dimensions. A thorough understanding of dimensional analysis helps us in deducing certain relations among different physical quantities and checking the derivation, accuracy and dimensional consistency or homogeneity of various mathematical expressions. When magnitudes of two or more physical quantities are multiplied, their units should be treated in the same manner as ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel identical units in the numerator and denominator. The same is true for dimensions of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical quantities represented by symbols on both sides of a mathematical equation must have the same dimensions.

#### 2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations

The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that oflength. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/time, or \([L\ T^{-1}]\).

Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions.

Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ x=x_{o}+v_{o}\ t+(1/2)\ a\ t^{2}\end{array}\]

for the distance \(x\) travelled by a particle or body in time \(t\) which starts from the position \(x_{o}\) with an initial velocity \(v_{o}\) at time \(t=0\) and has uniform acceleration \(a\) along the direction of motion.

The dimenstions of each term may be written as

\[\begin{array}{l}[x]=[L]\\ [x_{o}]=[L]\\ [v_{o}\ t]=[L\ T^{-1}]\ \ [T]\\ =[L]\\ [(1/2)\ a\ t^{2}]=[L\ T^{2}]\ [T^{2}]\\ =[L]\end{array}\]

As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation.

It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:33]

or, \(T=k\sqrt{\frac{I}{g}}\)

Note that value of constant \(k\) can not be obtained by the method of dimensions. Here it does not matter if some number multiplies the right side of this formula, because that does not affect its dimensions.

Actually, \(k=2\pi\) so that \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{I}{g}}\)

Dimensional analysis is very useful in deducing relations among the interdependent physical quantities. However, dimensionless constants cannot be obtained by this method. The method of dimensions can only test the dimensional validity, but not the exact relationship between physical quantities in any equation. It does not distinguish between the physical quantities having same dimensions.

A number of exercises at the end of this chapter will help you develop skill in dimensional analysis.

## Summary

* 1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity).
* 2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units.
* 3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.
* 4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.
* 5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, wait, etc).
* 6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).
* 7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers.
* 8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.
* 9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationships[s] are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained.
* 10. Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities. In measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of measuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account.
* 11. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and 'rounding off' the uncertain digits must be followed.
* 12. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.

* 2.14 A book with many printing errors contains four different formulas for the displacement \(y\) of a particle undergoing a certain periodic motion : (a) \(y=a\sin 2\pi\;t/T\) (b) \(y=a\sin\;vt\) (c) \(y=(a/T)\sin\;t/a\) (d) \(y=(a\sqrt{2})\;(sin\;2\pi\;t/T+\cos\;2\pi\;t/T)\) (\(a=\) maximum displacement of the particle, \(v=\) speed of the particle, \(T=\) time-period of motion).

* 2.15 A famous relation in physics relates'moving mass' \(m\) to the'rest mass' \(m_{o}\) of a particle in terms of its speed \(v\) and the speed of light, \(c\) (This relation firstarose as a consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein).

* 2.18 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast moving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite to the train's motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.) seem to be stationary. (In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these distant objects seem to move with you).
* 2.19 The principle of 'parallax' in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances of very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth's two locations six months apart in its orbit around the Sun. That is, the baseline is about the diameter of the Earth's orbit = \(3\times 10^{11}\)m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that with such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1" (second) of arc or so. A _parsec_ is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale. It is the distance of an object that will show a parallax of 1" (second) of arc from opposite ends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. How much is a parsec in terms of metres?2.20 The nearest star to our solar system is 4.29 light years away. How much is this distance in terms of parsecs? How much parallax would this star (named Alpha Centauri) show when viewed from two locations of the Earth sky months apart in its orbit around the Sun? 2.21 Precise measurements of physical quantities are a _need_ of science. For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed. Also, wherever you can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed. 2.22 Just as precise measurements are necessary in science, it is equally important to be able to make rough estimates of quantities using rudimentary ideas and common observations. Think of ways by which you can estimate the following (where an estimate is difficult to obtain, try to get an upper bound on the quantity) : (a) the total mass of rain-bearing clouds over India during the Monsoon (b) the mass of an elephant (c) the wind speed during a storm (d) the number of strands of hair on your head (e) the number of air molecules in your classroom. 2.23 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionized matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding 10' K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high temperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you expect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and liquids or gases? Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the Sun = 2.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{30}\) kg, radius of the Sun = 7.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) m. 2.24 When the planet Jupiter is at a distance of 824.7 million kilometers from the Earth, its angular diameter is measured to be 35.72' of arc. Calculate the diameter of Jupiter. Additional Exercises 2.25 A man walking briskly in rain with speed \(v\) must slant his umbrella forward making an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical.

Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to the present estimate on the age of the universe (\(\sim\)15 billion years). From the table of fundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number (or any other interesting number you can think of ). If its coincidence with the age of the universe were significant, what would this imply for the constancy of fundamental constants?

## Chapter 3 Motion in a Straight Line

### 3.1 Introduction

Motion is common to everything in the universe. We walk, run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies.

Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as **rectilinear motion**. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.

In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.

In **Kinematics**, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 5.

### 3.2 Position, Path Length and Displacement

Earlier you learnt that motion is change in position of an object with time. In order to specify position, we need to use a reference point and a set of axes. It is convenient to choosea rectangular coordinate system consisting of three mutually perpendicular axes, labelled X-, Y-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these three axes is called origin (O) and serves as the **reference point**. The coordinates (_x. y. z_) of an object describe the position of the object with respect to this coordinate system. To measure time, we position a clock in this system. This coordinate system along with a clock constitutes a **frame of reference**.

Ifone or more coordinates of an object change with time, we say that the object is in motion. Otherwise, the objects said to be at rest with respect to this frame of reference.

The choice of a set of axes in a frame of reference depends upon the situation. For example, for describing motion in one dimension, we need only one axis. To describe motion in two/three dimensions, we need a set of two/three axes.

Description of an event depends on the frame of reference chosen for the description. For example, when you say that a car is moving on a road, you are describing the car with respect to a frame of reference attached to you or to the ground. But with respect to a frame of reference attached with a person sitting in the car, the car is at rest.

To describe motion along a straight line, we can choose an axis, say _X_-axis, so that it coincides with the path of the object. We then measure the position of the object with reference to a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown in Fig. 1. Positions to the right of O are taken as positive and to the left of O, as negative. Following this convention, the position coordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 1 are +360 m and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate of point R is -1 20 m.

#### Path length

Consider the motion of a car along a straight line. We choose the _x_-axis such that it coincides with the path of the car's motion and origin of the axis as the point from where the car started moving, i.e. the car was at \(x\) = 0 at \(t\) = 0 (Fig. 1). Let P, Q and R represent the positions of the car at different instants of time. Consider two cases of motion. In the first case, the car moves from O to P. Then the distance moved by the car is OP = +360 m. **This distance is called the path length** traversed by the car. In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q. During this course of motion, the path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m + (+120 m) = + 480 m. Path length is a scalar quantity -- a quantity that has a magnitude only and no direction (see Chapter 4).

#### Displacement

It is useful to define another quantity displacement as the change in position. Let \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) be the positions of an object at time \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\). Thenits displacement, denoted by \(\Delta x\), in time \(\Delta t\) = \(\{t_{2}\) - \(t_{1}\}\), is given by the difference between the final and initial positions :

\(\Delta x\) = \(x_{2}\) - \(x_{1}\)

(We use the Greek letter delta (\(\Delta\)) to denote a change in a quantity.)

If \(x_{2}>x_{1}\), \(\Delta x\) is positive: and if \(x_{2}<x_{1}\), \(\Delta x\) is negative.

Displacement has both magnitude and direction. Such quantities are represented by vectors. You will read about vectors in the next chapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion along a straight line (also called **rectilinear motion**) only. In one-dimensional motion, there are _only two_ directions (backward and forward, upward and downward) in which an object can move, and these two directions can easily be specified by + and - signs. For example, displacement of the car in moving from O to P is:

\(\Delta x\) = \(x_{2}\) - \(x_{1}\) = (+360 m) - 0 m = +360 m

The displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and is directed in the positive \(x\) direction as indicated by the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the car from P to Q is 240 m - 360 m = - 120 m. The

Figure 1: x-axis, origin and positions of a car at different times.

negative sign indicates the direction of displacement. Thus, it is not necessary to use vector notation for discussing motion of objects in one-dimension.

**The magnitude of displacement may or may not be equal to the path length traversed by an object.** For example, for motion of the car from O to P. the path length is +360 m and the displacement is +360 m. In this case, the magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to the path length (360 m). But consider the motion of the car from O to P and back to Q. In this case, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = + 480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) - (0 m) = + 240 m. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (240 m) is not equal to the path length (480 m).

The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is **not zero**. For example, if the car starts from O, goes to P and then returns to O. the final position coincides with the initial position and the displacement is zero. However, the path length of this journey is OP + PO = 360 m + 360 m = 720 m.

Motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph as you have already learnt about it. Such a graph is a powerful tool to represent and analyse different aspects of motion of an object. For motion along a straight line. say \(X\)-axis. only \(x\)-coordinate varies with time and we have an \(x\)-\(t\) graph. Let us first consider the simple case in which an object is stationary. e.g. a car standing still at \(x\) = 40 m. The position-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis. as shown in Fig. 3.2(a).

If an object moving along the straight line covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in **uniform motion** along a straight line. Fig. 3.2(b) shows the position-time graph of such a motion.

Figure 3.3: Position-time graph of a car.

Figure 3.2: Position-time graph of (a) stationary object, and (b) an object in uniform motion.

Now, let us consider the motion of a car that starts from rest at time \(t=0\) s from the origin O and picks up speed till \(t=10\) s and thereafter moves with uniform speed till \(t=18\) s. Then the brakes are applied and the car stops at \(t=20\) s and \(x=296\) m. The position-time graph for this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer to this graph in our discussion in the following sections.

### Average velocity and average speed

When an object is in motion, its position changes with time. But how fast is the position changing with time and in what direction? To describe this, we define the quantity **average velocity**. Average velocity is defined as the change in position or displacement (\(\Delta x\)) divided by the time intervals (\(\Delta t\)), in which the displacement occurs :

\[\dot{\overline{v}}=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \tag{3.1}\]

where \(x_{2}\) and \(x_{1}\) are the positions of the object at time \(t_{2}\)and \(t_{1}\), respectively. Here the bar over the symbol for velocity is a standard notation used to indicate an average quantity. The SI unit for velocity is m/s or m s-i, although km h-i is used in many everyday applications.

Like displacement, average velocity is also a vector quantity. But as explained earlier, for motion in a straight line, the directional aspect of the vector can be taken care of by + and - signs and we do not have to use the vector notation for velocity in this chapter.

Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3. The portion of the \(x\)-\(t\) graph between \(t=0\) s and \(t=8\) s is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4. As seen from the plot, the average velocity of the car between time \(t=5\) s and \(t=7\) s is :

\[\dot{\overline{v}}=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{(27.4-10.0)m}{(7-5)s }=8.7\,m\,s^{-1}\]

Geometrically, this is the slope of the straight line P\({}_{1}\)P\({}_{2}\) connecting the initial position P\({}_{1}\) to the final position P\({}_{2}\) as shown in Fig. 3.4.

The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement. It is zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows the \(x\)-\(t\) graphs for an object, moving with positive velocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity (Fig. 3.5b) and at rest (Fig. 3.5c).

Average velocity as defined above involves only the displacement of the object. We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length. To describe the rate of motion over the actual path, we introduce another quantity called **average speed**.

**Average speed** is defined as the total path length travelled divided by the total time interval during which the motion has taken place :

\[\dot{\overline{\mathit{Average speed}}-\frac{Total\,path\,length}{Total\, time\,interval}} \tag{3.2}\]

Average speed has obviously the same unit (m s-i) as that of velocity. But it does not tell us in what direction an object is moving. Thus, it is always positive (in contrast to the average velocity which can be positive or negative). If the motion of an object is along a straight line and in the **same direction**, the magnitude of displacement is equal to the total path length. In that case, the magnitude of average velocity is equal to the average speed. This is not always the case, as you will see in the following example._

Example 3.1: A car is moving along a straight line, say OP in Fig. 3.1. It moves from O to Pin 18 s and returns from P to Q in 6.0 s. What are the average velocity and average speed of the car in going (a) from O to P? and (b) from O to P and back to Q?

Answer (a):

Average velocity - \(\frac{\cdot}{\text{Time interval}}\):

\[\frac{\cdot}{\text{{v}}}=\frac{+\text{ 360 m}}{18\text{ s}}=+\text{ 20 m s}^{-1}\]

Average speed - \(\frac{\text{Path length}}{\text{Time interval}}\):

\[\cdot=\frac{360\text{ m}}{18\text{ s}}=20\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.

(b) In this case,

Average velocity = \(\frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Time interval}}-\frac{+240\text{ m}}{(18+6.0) \text{ s}}\):

\[\cdot=+10\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Path length}}{\text{Time interval}}=\frac{\text{OP + PQ}}{\Delta t}\):

\[\cdot=\frac{(360+120)\text{ m}}{24\text{ s}}=20\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

Thus, in this case the average speed is _not_ equal to the magnitude of the average velocity. This happens because the motion here involves change in direction so that the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. This shows that speed is, in general, greater than the magnitude of the velocity. \(\ll\)

If the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P and comes back to O in the same time interval, average speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity is zero!

### Instantaneous velocity and speed

The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval. For this, we define **instantaneous velocity** or simply velocity \(v\) at an instant \(t\).

The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval \(\Delta t\) becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,

\[v=\lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \tag{3.3a}\] \[\cdot \tag{3.3b}\]

where the symbol \(\frac{\text{{lim}}}{\Delta t\to 0}\) stands for the operation of taking limit as \(\Delta t\to 0\) of the quantity on its right. In the language of calculus, the quantity on the right hand side of Eq. (3.3a) is the differential coefficient of \(x\) with respect to \(t\) and is denoted by \(\frac{\cdot\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}\) (see Appendix 3.1). It is the rate of change of position with respect to time, at that instant.

We can use Eq. (3.3a) for obtaining the value of velocity at an instant either **graphically** or **numerically**. Suppose that we want to obtain graphically the value of velocity at time \(t=4\text{ s}\) (point P) for the motion of the car represented in Fig. 3.3. The figure has been redrawn in Fig. 3.6 choosing different scales to facilitate the

Figure 3.6: Determining velocity from positive time graph. Velocity at \(t=4\text{ s}\) is the slope of the tangent to the graph at that instant.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:44]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]

that the acceleration is nonuniform over the period 0 s to 10 s. It is zero between 10 s and 18 s and is constant with value -12 m s-2 between 18 s and 20 s. When the acceleration is uniform, obviously, it equals the average acceleration over that period.

Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration: downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3, the regions of the curve that correspond to these three cases.

Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is \(v_{{}_{o}}\) at \(t=0\) and \(v\) at time \(t\), we have

\[\overline{a}=\frac{v-v_{0}}{t-0}\;\;\text{or}\;\;v=v_{0}+\alpha\,t \tag{3.6}\]

Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like for some simple cases. Fig. 3.10 shows velocity-time graph for motion with constant acceleration for the following cases :

1. An object is moving in a positive direction with a positive acceleration, for example the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3 between \(t=0\) s and \(t=10\) s.
2. An object is moving in positive direction with a negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car moving from 0 in Fig. 3.1 in negative acceleration with increasing speed.
3. An object is moving in positive direction till time \(t_{{}_{I}}\), and then turns back with the same negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car from point O to point Q in Fig. 3.1 till time \(t_{{}_{I}}\) with decreasing speed and turning back and moving with the same negative acceleration.

An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that **the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval**. A general proof of this

Figure 3.10: Velocity–time graph for motions with constant acceleration.(a) Motion in positive direction with positive acceleration, (b) Motion in positive direction with negative acceleration, (c) Motion in negative acceleration with negative acceleration, (d) Motion of an object with negative acceleration that changes direction at time \(t_{{}_{I}}\). Between times 0 to \(t_{{}_{I}}\), its moves in positive \(x\) - direction and between \(t_{{}_{I}}\) and \(t_{{}_{I}}\) it moves in the opposite direction.

Figure 3.9: Position-time graph for motion with (a) positive acceleration; (b) negative acceleration, and(c) zero acceleration,

statement requires use of calculus. We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity \(u\). Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.11.

The \(v\)-\(t\) curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between \(t=0\) and \(t=T\) is the area of the rectangle of height \(u\) and base \(T\). Therefore, area \(=u\times T=uT\) which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer.

**Note that the \(x\)-\(t\), \(v\)-\(t\) and \(a\)-\(t\) graphs shown in several figures in this chapter have sharp kinks at some points implying that the functions are not differentiable at these points. In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth.**

**What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity cannot change values abruptly at an instant. Changes are always continuous.**

### Kinematic Equations for Uniformly Accelerated Motion

For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (\(x\)), time taken (\(t\)), initial velocity (\(v_{o}\)), final velocity (\(v\)) and acceleration (\(a\)). Equation (3.6) already obtained gives a relation between final and initial velocities \(v\) and \(v_{o}\) of an object moving with uniform acceleration \(a\) :

\[v=v_{o}+at \tag{3.6}\]

This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3.12. The area under this curve is :

Area between instants \(0\) and \(t=\) Area of triangle ABC + Area of rectangle OACD

As explained in the previous section, the area under \(v\)-\(t\) curve represents the displacement. Therefore, the displacement \(x\) of the object is :

\[x=\frac{1}{2}(v-v_{o})t+v_{o}t \tag{3.7}\]

But \(v-v_{0}=a\,t\)

Therefore, \(x=\frac{1}{2}\,a\,t^{2}+v_{o}t\)

or, \(x=v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}\,at^{2}\)

Equation (3.7) can also be written as

\[x=\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}t=\overline{v}\,t \tag{3.9a}\]

where,

\[\dot{\overline{v}}=\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}\] (constant acceleration only)

Equations (3.9a) and (3.9b) mean that the object has undergone displacement \(x\) with an average velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the initial and final velocities.

From Eq. (3.6), \(t=(v-v_{o})/a\). Substituting this in Eq. (3.9a), we get

\[x=\overline{v}\,t=\left(\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{v-v_{0}}{a} \right)=\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2\,a}\]

\[\dot{v}^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2\alpha x \tag{3.10}\]

_FIRST METHOD_ : In the first method, we split the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken \(t_{{}_{1}}\) and \(t_{{}_{2}}\). Since the velocity at B is zero, we have :

\(v=v_{{}_{0}}+at\)

\(0=20-10t_{{}_{1}}\)

Or. \(t_{{}_{1}}=2\) s

This is the time in going from \(A\) to \(B\). From \(B\), or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative \(y\) direction. We use equation.

\(y=y_{{}_{0}}+v_{{}_{0}}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\)

We have. \(\underline{v}_{{}_{0}}=45\) m, \(y=0\), \(v_{{}_{0}}=0\), \(a=-g=-10\) m s\({}^{{}_{2}}\)

Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before it hits the ground = \(t_{{}_{1}}+t_{{}_{2}}=2\) s+ 3 s= 5 s.

**traversed during successive intervals of time.** Since initial velocity is zero, we have \(y=-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}\) Using this equation, we can calculate the position of the object after different time intervals, 0. t. 2t. 3t... which are given in second column of Table 3.2. If we take (-1/2)gt\({}^{2}\) as \(y_{o}\)--the position coordinate after first time interval t. then third column gives the positions in the unit of \(y_{o}\). The fourth column gives the distances traversed in successive t.s. We find that the distances are in the simple ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9: 11... as shown in the last column. This law was established by Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) who was the first to make quantitative studies of free fall. 

**Example 3.7**Stopping distance of vehicles : When brakes are applied to a moving vehicle, the distance it travels before stopping is called stopping distance. It is an important factor for road safety and depends on the initial velocity (\(v_{o}\)) and the braking capacity, or deceleration, \(-a\) that is caused by the braking. Derive an expression for stopping distance of a vehicle in terms of \(v_{o}\) and \(a\).

**Answer**: **Let the distance travelled by the vehicle before it stops be \(d_{s}\). Then, using equation of motion \(v^{2}=v_{o}{}^{2}+2\)\(ax\), and noting that \(v=0\), we have the stopping distance**

parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, \(x\)-t graph is a parabola while the \(v\)-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.
10. The area under the velocity-time curve between times \(t_{i}\) and \(t_{2}\) is equal to the displacement of the object during that interval of time.
11. For objects in uniformly accelerated re collinear motion, the five quantities, displacement \(x\), time taken \(t\), initial velocity \(v_{0}\), final velocity \(v\) and acceleration \(a\) are related by a set of simple equations called _kinematic equations of motion_ : \[v=v_{0}+at\] \[v=v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\] \[v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2\alpha x\] if the position of the object at time \(t=0\) is \(0\). If the particle starts at \(x=x_{0}\), \(x\) in above equations is replaced by \(\{x-x_{0}\}\).

**POINTS TO PODER**

1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. In one dimension, the two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.
2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.
3. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.
4. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.
5. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle's speed is increasing or decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice of the positive direction of the axis. For example, if the vertically upward direction is chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is negative. If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative, results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward, the same negative acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.
6. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration at that instant. A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration. For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.
7. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.11)], the various quantities are algebraic, i.e. they may be positive or negative. The equations are applicable in all situations (for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.
8. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)) are exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (3.11)) are true only for motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during the course of motion.

## Appendix 3.1: ELEMENTS OF CALCULUS

### Differential Calculus

Using the concept of 'differential coefficient' or 'derivative', we can easily define velocity and acceleration. Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall in produce this concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities involved in motion.

Suppose we have a quantity \(y\) whose value depends upon a single variable \(x\), and is expressed by an equation defining \(y\) as some specific function of \(x\). This is represented as:

\[y=f(x) \tag{1}\]

This relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function \(y=f(x)\) regarding \(y\) and \(x\) as Cartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a).

Consider the point P on the curve \(y=f(x)\) whose coordinates are \(\{x,y\}\) and another point \(Q\) where coordinates are \(\{x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y\}\). The slope of the line joining P and \(Q\) is given by:

\[\tan\theta-\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}-\frac{(y+\Delta y)-y}{\Delta x} \tag{2}\]

Suppose now that the point \(Q\) moves along the curve towards P. In this process, \(\Delta y\,and\,\Delta x\) decrease and approach zero; though their ratio \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) will not necessarily vanish. What happens to the line P\(Q\) as \(\Delta y\to 0\), \(\Delta x\to 0\). You can see that this line becomes a tangent to the curve at point P as shown in Fig. 3.30(b). This means that \(\tan\theta\) approaches the slope of the tangent at P, denoted by \(m\):

\[m=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(y+\Delta y)-y}{ \Delta x} \tag{3}\]

_The limit of the ratio \(\Delta y/\Delta x\) as \(\Delta x\) approaches zero is called the derivative of \(y\,with\,respect\,to\,x\)_ and is written as \(\mathrm{d}y/\Delta x\). It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y=f(x)\) at the point \(\{x,y\}\).

Since \(y=f(x)\) and \(y+\Delta y=f(x+\Delta x)\), we can write the definition of the derivative as:

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}-\frac{\mathrm{d}f\,x}{\mathrm{d}x}-\lim_{ \Delta x\to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}-\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\left[\frac{f(x+\Delta x )-f(x)}{\Delta x}\right]\]

Given below are some elements formulae for derivatives of functions. In these \(u(x)\) and \(v(x)\) represent arbitrary functions of \(x\), and a and b denote constant quantities that are independent of \(x\). Derivatives of some common functions are also listed.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:62]

To calculate the area under this curve [Fig. 3.31 (ii)], let us employ the following trick. Divide the interval on \(x\)-axis from \(a\,to\,b\) in to a large number \([N]\) of small intervals: \(x_{0}(=a)\) to \(x_{1},x_{1}\) to \(x_{2}:x_{2}\) to \(x_{3}\),........................\(x_{N-1}\) to \(x_{N}(=b)\). The area under the curve is thus divided into \(N\) strips. Each strip is approximately a rectangle, since the variation of \(F(x)\) over a strip is negligible. The area of the i\({}^{th}\) strip shown [Fig. 3.31 (ii)] is then approximately

\[\dot{\Delta}A_{i}=F(x_{i})\{x_{i}-x_{i-1}\}=F(x_{i})\Delta x\]

where \(\Delta x\) is the width of the strip which we have taken to be the same for all the strips. You may wonder whether we should put \(F(x_{i-1})\) or the mean of \(F(x_{i})\) and \(F(x_{i-1})\) in the above expression. If we take \(N\) to be very very large \(\{N\!\!\rightarrow\!\!\infty\}\), it does not really matter, since then the strip will be so thin that the difference between \(F(x_{i})\) and \(F(x_{i-1})\) is vanishingly small. The total area under the curve then is:

\[A-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Delta A_{i}-\sum_{i=1}^{N}F(x_{i})\Delta x\]

The limit of this sum as \(N\!\!\rightarrow\!\!\infty\) is known as the integral of \(F(x)\) over \(x\) from a to b. It is given a special symbol as shown below:

\[A=\int_{a}^{b}F(x)dx\]

The integral sign \(\int\limits_{a}\) looks like an elongated S, reminding us that it basically is the limit of the sum of an infinite number of terms.

A most significant mathematical fact is that integration is, in a sense, an inverse of differentiation. Suppose we have a function \(g(x)\) whose derivative is \(f(x)\), i.e. \(f(x)-\frac{dg(x)}{dx}\)

The function \(g(x)\) is known as the indefinite integral of \(f(x)\) and is denoted as:

\[g(x)-\int f(x)dx\]

An integral with lower and upper limits is known as a definite integral. It is a number. Indefinite integral has no limits; it is a function.

A fundamental theorem of mathematics states that

\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=g(x)\left|_{a}^{b}=g(b)-g(a)\right.\]

As an example, suppose \(f(x)=x^{2}\) and we wish to determine the value of the definite integral from \(x=1\) to \(x=2\). The function \(g(x)\) whose derivative is \(x^{2}\) is \(x^{3}/3\). Therefore,

\[\int_{1}^{2}x^{2}\,dx=\frac{x^{3}}{3}\left|_{1}^{2}=\frac{8}{3}-\frac{1}{3}= \frac{7}{3}\right.\]

Clearly, to evaluate definite integrals, we need to know the corresponding indefinite integrals. Some common indefinite integrals are \[\begin{array}{ll}\cdot&\quad\int x^{n}\mathrm{d}x=\ \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}& \quad\quad\quad(n\neq-1)\\ \cdot&\quad\quad\int(\frac{1}{x})\mathrm{d}x=\ln x&\quad\quad\quad(x>0)\\ \cdot&\quad\int\sin x\ \mathrm{d}x=-\cos x&\quad\quad\int\cos x\ \mathrm{d}x=\sin x\\ \cdot&\quad\int\mathrm{e}^{x}\mathrm{d}x=\mathrm{e}^{x}\end{array}\]

This introduction to differential and integral calculus is not rigorous and is intended to convey to you the basic notions of calculus.

## Chapter 4 Motion in a Plane

### 4.1 Introduction

In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and - signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. Butin order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.

The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.

### 4.2 Scalars and Vectors

In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a **direction** is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are : the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and dividedjust as the ordinary numbers*. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m = 3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 24.2 \({}^{\circ}\)C respectively. Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 11.4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}\) (a scalar) and its density is 2.7\(\times\)10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\) (a scalar).

Footnote *: _Addition and sub trace for scalars make sense only for quantities with sameunits. However, you can multiply and divide scalars of different units._

A **vector** quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the **triangle law of addition** or equivalently the **parallelogram law of addition**. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force.

To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol **v**. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say \(\vec{v}\). Thus, both **v** and \(\vec{v}\) represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by \(|\textbf{v}\|=v\). Thus, a vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. by **A, a, p, q, r,... x, y**, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face _A, a, p, q, r,... x, y_.

#### 4.2.1 Position and Displacement Vectors

To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say O as origin. Let P and P' be the positions of the object at time \(t\) and \(t\), respectively [Fig. 4.1(a)]. We join O and P by a straight line. Then, **OP** is the position vector of the object at time \(t\). An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol **r**, i.e. **OP** = **r**. Point P' is **represented by another position vector, **OP'** denoted by **r'**. The length of the vector **r** represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P', the vector **PP'** (with tail at P and tip at P') is called the **displacement vector** corresponding to motion from point P (at time \(t\) to point P' (at time \(t\)).)

It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, in Fig. 4.1b, given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same **PQ** for different paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ. Therefore, the **magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points**. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line.

#### 4.2.2 Equality of Vectors

Two **A** and **B** are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the same magnitude and the same direction.**10

Footnote 10: In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.

Figure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors **A** and **B**. We can easily check their equality. Shift **B** parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that of \(A\), i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since their **S** and **P** also coincide, the two vectors are said to be equal. In general, equality is indicated

Figure 4.1: (a) _Position and displacement vectors._ (b) _Displacement vector_ **PQ** _and different courses of motion._

as **A** = **B**. Note that in Fig. 4.2(b), vectors **A**' and **B**' have the same magnitude but they are not equal because they have different directions. Even if we shift **B**' parallel to itself so that its tail \(Q\)' coincides with the tail \(O\)' of **A**'. the tip \(S\)' of **B**' does not coincide with the tip \(P\)' of **A**'.

### Multiplication of Vectors by Weak Numbers

Multiplying a vector **A** with a positive number \(\lambda\) gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by the factor \(\lambda\) but the direction is the same as that of **A**:

\[\left|\begin{array}{c}\lambda\textbf{A}\end{array}\right|=\lambda\left| \begin{array}{c}\textbf{A}\end{array}\right|\text{ if}\lambda>0.\]

For example, if **A** is multiplied by 2, the resultant vector \(2\textbf{A}\) is in the same direction as **A** and has a magnitude twice of \(|\textbf{A}|\) as shown in Fig. 4.3(a).

Multiplying a vector **A** by a negative number \(\lambda\) gives a vector \(\lambda\textbf{A}\) whose direction is opposite to the direction of **A** and whose magnitude is \(-\lambda\) times \(|\textbf{A}|\).

Multiplying a given vector **A** by negative numbers, say \(-1\) and \(-1.5\), gives vectors as shown in Fig 4.3(b).

The factor \(\lambda\) by which a vector **A** is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension. Then, the dimension of \(\lambda\)**A** is the product of the dimensions of \(\lambda\) and **A**. For example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector by duration (of time), we get a displacement vector.

### Addition and Subtraction of Vectors -- Graphical Method

As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical method. Let us consider two vectors **A** and **B** that lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a). The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors. To find the sum **A** + **B**, we place vector **B** so that its tail is at the head of the vector **A**, as in Fig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of **A** to the head of **B**. This line \(\mathsf{O}\mathsf{Q}\) represents a vector **R**, that is, the sum of the vectors **A** and **B**. Since, in this procedure of vector addition, vectors are

Figure 4.4: (a) _Vector_ **A** _and_ **B**. (b) _Vectors_ **A** _and_ **B**. (b) _Vector_ **A** _and_ _result_ _vectors_ _after multiplying it by a negative number \(-1\) and \(-1.5\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:70]

So far we have considered a vector lying in an \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The same procedure can be used to resolve a general vector \(\mathbf{A}\) into three components along \(x\)-, \(y\)-, and z-axes in three dimensions. If \(\alpha\)\(\beta\). and \(\gamma\) are the angles* between \(\mathbf{A}\) and the \(x\)-, \(y\)-, and z-axes, respectively Fig. 4.9(d), we have

Footnote *: _Note that angles \(\alpha\)\(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) are angles in space. They are between pairs of lines, which are not coplanar._

\[\mathbf{A}_{x}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{s}\alpha,\;\mathbf{A}_{y}=\mathbf{A} \cos\beta,\;\mathbf{A}_{z}=\mathbf{A}\cos\gamma\] (4.16a) In general, we have \[\mathbf{A}=A_{x}\hat{\mathbf{i}}+A_{y}\hat{\mathbf{j}}+A_{x}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\] (4.16b) The magnitude of vector \[\mathbf{A}\] is \[\mathbf{A}=\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+A_{z}^{2}}\] (4.16c) A position vector \[\mathbf{r}\] can be expressed as \[\mathbf{r}-x\hat{\mathbf{i}}+y\hat{\mathbf{j}}+z\mathbf{k}\] (4.17) where \[x,y\]. and z are the components of \[\mathbf{r}\] along \[x,y\].  z-axes, respectively.

### Vector Addition - Analytical Method

Although the graphical method of adding vectors helps us in visualising the vectors and the resultant vector. it is sometimes tedious and has limited accuracy. It is much easier to add vectors by combining their respective components. Consider two vectors \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) in \(x\)-\(y\) plane with components \(A_{x}\), \(A_{y}\) and \(B_{x}\), \(B_{y}\) :

\[\mathbf{A}=A_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+A_{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}} \tag{4.18}\]

\[\mathbf{B}=B_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+B_{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}}\]

Let \(\mathbf{R}\) be their sum. We have \[\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}\\ \cdot\\ \cdot\end{array}\] (4.19a) Since vectors obey the commutative and associative laws, we can arrange and regroup the vectors in Eq. (4.19a) as convenient to us : \[\mathbf{R}=\big{(}A_{x}+B_{x}\big{)}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+\big{(}A_{y}+B_{y} \big{)}\mathbf{\hat{j}}\] (4.19b) \[\cdot\\ \mathbf{Since}\mathbf{R}=R_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+R_{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}}\] (4.20) we have : \[R_{x}=A_{x}+B_{x},\;\;R_{y}=A_{y}+B_{y}\] (4.21) Thus, each component of the resultant vector \[\mathbf{R}\] is the sum of the corresponding components of \[\mathbf{A}\] and \[\mathbf{B}\].

In three dimensions, we have

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{A}=A_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+A_{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}}+A_{ z}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\\ \mathbf{B}=B_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}+B_{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}}+B_{z}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\\ \mathbf{R}=\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}=R_{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}}

\(\Delta t_{3}\), respectively. The direction of the average velocity \(\overline{\textbf{v}}\) is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for three decreasing values of \(\Delta t\), i.e. \(\Delta t_{1}\), \(\Delta t_{2}\), and \(\Delta t_{3}\), \(\{\Delta t_{1}>\Delta t_{2}>\Delta t_{3}\}\). As \(\Delta t\to 0\), \(\Delta t\to 0\) and is along the tangent to the path [Fig. 4.13(d)]. Therefore, **the direction of velocity at any point on the path of an object is tangential to the path at that point and is in the direction of motion**.

We can express **v** in a component form :

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ \textbf{v}=\frac{\text{d}\textbf{r}}{\text{d}t}\\ \cdot\\ =\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\textbf{f}^{+}_{ \Delta t}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}\textbf{f}^{\prime}\right)\\ \cdot\\ =\textbf{f}^{\prime\prime}\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\left(\frac{\Delta x}{ \Delta t}+\textbf{f}^{\prime\prime}\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\frac{\Delta y}{ \Delta t}\right)\\ \cdot\\

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:76]

This relative velocity vector as shown in Fig. 4.16 makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical. It is given by

\[\tan\,\theta=\frac{v_{b}}{v_{r}}=\frac{12}{35}=0.343\]

Or, \(\theta\equiv 19^{\circ}\)

Therefore, the woman should hold her umbrella at an angle of about \(19^{\circ}\) with the vertical towards the west.

Note carefully the difference between this Example and the Example 4.1. In Example 4.1, the boy experiences the resultant (vector sum) of two velocities while in this example, the woman experiences the velocity of rain relative to the bicycle (the vector difference of the two velocities). \(\triangleleft\)

### PROJECTILEMOTION

As an application of the ideas developed in the previous sections, we consider the motion of a projectile. An object that is in flight after being thrown or projected is called a **projectile**. Such a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a baseball or any other object. The motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate, simultaneously occurring components of motions. One component is along a horizontal direction without any acceleration and the other along the vertical direction with constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was Galileo who first stated this independency of the horizontal and the vertical components of projectile motion in his **Dialogue on the great world systems** (1632).

In our discussion, we shall assume that the air resistance has negligible effect on the motion of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is launched with velocity \(\mathbf{v}_{o}\) that makes an angle \(\theta_{o}\) with the \(x\)-axis as shown in Fig. 4.17.

After the object has been projected, the acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity which is directed vertically downward:

\[\mathbf{a}=-g\mathbf{j}\]

Or, \(\alpha_{x}=0\), \(\alpha_{y}=-g\)

The components of initial velocity \(\mathbf{v}_{o}\) are :

\[v_{ax}=v_{a}\cos\,\theta_{o}\]

\[v_{ay}=v_{a}\sin\,\theta_{a} \tag{4.37}\]

If we take the initial position to be the origin of the reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we have :

\[x_{a}=0\]

,

\[y_{a}=0\]

Then, Eq.(4.47b) becomes :

\[x=v_{ax}\,t=\left[v_{a}\cos\,\theta_{a}\right]t\]

and \(y=\left(v_{a}\sin\,\theta_{a}\right)\,t-\left(\,\forall z\right)g\,t^{2}\)

The components of velocity at time \(t\) can be obtained using Eq.(4.33b) :

\[v_{x}=v_{ax}=v_{a}\cos\,\theta_{a}\]

\[v_{y}=v_{a}\sin\,\theta_{a}-g\,t \tag{4.38}\]

Equation (4.38) gives the \(x\)-, and \(y\)-coordinates of the position of a projectile at time \(t\) in terms of two parameters -- initial speed \(v_{a}\) and projection angle \(\theta_{a}\). Notice that the choice of mutually perpendicular \(x\)-, and \(y\)-directions for the analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in a simplification. One of the components of velocity, i.e. \(x\)-component remains constant throughout the motion and only the \(y\)- component changes, like an object in free fall in vertical direction. This is shown graphically at few instants in Fig. 4.18. Note that at the point of maximum height, \(v_{y}\)= 0 and therefore,

\[\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}=0\]

Equation of path of a projectile

What is the shape of the path followed by the projectile? This can be seen by eliminating the time between the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) as given in Eq. (4.38). We obtain:\[y=(\tan\theta_{o})x-\frac{g}{2\left(v_{o}\cos\theta_{o}\right)^{2}}x^{2} \tag{4.40}\]

Now, since \(g\), \(\theta_{o}\) and \(v_{o}\) are constants, Eq. (4.40) is of the form \(y=a\,x+b\,x^{2}\), in which \(a\) and \(b\) are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, i.e. the path of the projectile is a parabola [Fig. 4.18].

#### Time of maximum height

How much time does the projectile take to reach the maximum height? Let this time be denoted by \(t_{m}\). Since at this point, \(v_{o}=0\), we have from Eq. (4.39):

\[v_{y}=v_{o}\,\sin\theta_{o}-g\,t_{m}=0\] (4.41a) Or, \[t_{m}=v_{o}\,\sin\theta_{o}/g \tag{4.41b}\]

The total time \(T_{f}\) during which the projectile is in flight can be obtained by putting \(y=0\) in Eq. (4.38). We get :

\[T_{f}=2\left(v_{o}\,\sin\theta_{o}\right)/g \tag{4.41b}\]

\(T_{f}\) is known as the **time of flight** of the projectile. We note that \(T_{f}=2\ t_{m}\), which is expected because of the symmetry of the parabolic path.

#### Maximum height of a projectile

The maximum height \(h_{m}\) reached by the projectile can be calculated by substituting \(t=t_{m}\)in Eq. (4.38) :

\[y=h_{m}=\left(v_{o}\sin\theta_{0}\right)\left(\frac{v_{o}\sin\theta_{0}}{g} \right)-\frac{g}{2}\left(\frac{v_{o}\sin\theta_{0}}{g}\right)^{2}\]

\[\cdot \tag{4.42}\]

#### Horizontal range of a projectile

The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position (\(x=y=0\)) to the position where it passes \(y=0\) during its fall is called the **horizontal range**, \(R\). It is the distance travelled during the time of flight \(T_{f}\). Therefore, the range \(R\) is

\[R =\left(v_{o}\,\cos\theta_{o}\right)\left(T_{f}\right) \tag{4.43a}\] \[=\left(v_{o}\,\cos\theta_{o}\right)\,\left(2\ v_{o}\,\sin\theta_{o} \right)/g\] \[\cdot\] (4.43b) Or, \[R =\frac{v_{0}^{2}\,\sin 2\theta_{0}}{g} \tag{4.43c}\]

Equation (4.43a) shows that for a given projection velocity \(v_{o}\), \(R\) is maximum when \(\sin 2\theta_{0}\) is maximum, i.e., when \(\theta_{0}=45^{o}\).

The maximum horizontal range is, therefore,

\[R_{m}=\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g} \tag{4.43d}\]

*Example 4.7** Galileo, in his book Two new sciences, stated that "for elevations which exceed or fall short of \(45^{o}\) by equal amounts, the ranges are equal". Prove this statement.

#### Answer

For a projectile launched with vel ocity \(\nu_{o}\) at an angle \(\theta_{o}\), the range is given by

\[R=\frac{v_{0}^{2}\,\sin 2\theta_{0}}{g}\]

Now, for angles, \((45^{o}+\alpha)\) and \(\left[\,45^{o}-\alpha\right]\), \(2\theta_{o}\)is \((90^{o}+2\alpha)\) and \(\left[\,90^{o}-2\alpha\right]\), respectively. The values of \(\sin\,(90^{o}+2\alpha)\) and \(\sin\,(90^{o}-2\alpha)\) are the same, equal to that of \(\cos 2\alpha\). Therefore, ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or fall short of \(45^{o}\) by equal amounts \(\alpha\). \(\triangleleft\)

Example 4.8Ahiker stands on the edge of a cliff 490 m above the ground and throws a stone horizontally with an initial speed of 15 m s\({}^{-1}\). Neglecting air resistance, find the time taken by the stone to reach the ground, and the speed with which it hits the ground. (Take \(g=9.8\) m s\({}^{2}\)).

Figure 4.18: The path of a projectile is a parabola.

_Answer_ We choose the origin of the \(x\)-,and \(y\)-axis at the edge of the cliff and \(t=0\) s at the instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive direction of \(x\)-axis to be along the initial velocity and the positive direction of \(y\)-axis to be the vertically upward direction. The \(x\)-, and \(y\)-components of the motion can be treated independently. The equations of motion are :

\(x\)_(t)_ = \(x_{{}_{0}}+v_{{}_{0}x}\)_t_

\(y\)_(t)_ = \(y_{{}_{0}}+v_{{}_{0}y}\)_t_+(1/2)_a_\({}_{y}t^{2}\)

Here, \(x_{{}_{0}}=y_{{}_{0}}=0\), \(v_{{}_{0}y}=0\), \(a_{{}_{0}}=-g\) = -9.8 m s\({}^{2}\), \(v_{{}_{0x}}=15\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

The stone hits the ground when \(y(t)=-490\) m. - 490 m = -(1/2)(9.8) t\({}^{2}\).

This gives \(t=10\) s.

The velocity components are \(v_{{}_{0}x}=v_{{}_{0x}}\) and \(v_{{}_{0}y}=v_{{}_{0y}}-g\) t

so that when the stone hits the ground :

\(v_{{}_{0x}}=15\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(v_{{}_{0y}}=0\) - 9.8 x 10 = - 98 m s\({}^{-1}\)

Therefore, the speed of the stone is

\(\sqrt[]{v_{{}_{0}x}^{2}+v_{{}_{0}y}^{2}}=\sqrt[]{15^{2}+98^{2}}=99\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

_Example 4.9_ A cricket ball is thrown at a speed of 28 m s\({}^{-1}\) in a direction 30\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal. Calculate (a) the maximum height, (b) the time taken by the ball to return to the same level, and (c) the distance from the thrower to the point where the ball returns to the same level.

_Answer_ (a) The maximum height is given by

\(h_{{}_{m}}=\frac{\left(v_{{}_{0}}\sin\theta_{{}_{0}}\right)^{2}}{2g}=\frac{ \left(28\sin 30^{\circ}\right)^{2}}{2\ \left(9.8\right)}\) m

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{14\times 14}{2\times 9.8}=10.0\) m

(b) The time taken to return to the same level is \(T_{{}_{f}}=\{2\ v_{{}_{0}}\ \sin\ \theta_{{}_{0}}\}/g=\{2\times 28\times\sin 30^{ \circ}\}/9.8\) = 28/9.8 s = 2.9 s

(c) The distance from the thrower to the point where the ball returns to the same level is \(\cdot\)

\(R=\frac{\left(v_{{}_{0}}^{2}\sin 2\theta_{{}_{0}}\right)}{g}=\frac{28\times 28 \times\sin 60^{\circ}}{9.8}=69\) m

### 4.11 Uniform Circular Motion

When an object follows a circular path at a constant speed, the motion of the object is called uniform circular motion. The word "uniform" refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant) throughout the motion. Suppose an object is moving with uniform speed \(v\) in a circle of radius \(R\) as shown in Fig. 4.19. Since the velocity of the object is changing continuously in direction, the object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the magnitude and the direction of this acceleration.

Let \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\) be the position vectors and \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\) + the velocities of the object when it is at point \(P\) and \(P^{\prime}\) + as shown in Fig. 4.19(a). By definition, velocity at a point is along the tangent at that point in the direction of motion. The velocity vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\) + are as shown in Fig. 4.19(a1). \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) is obtained in Fig. 4.19 (a2) using the triangle law of vector addition. Since the path is circular, \(\mathbf{v}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{r}\) and so is \(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\) + to \(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\) +. Therefore, \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) is perpendicular to \(\Delta\mathbf{r}\). Since average acceleration is along \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\left(\overline{\mathbf{a}}-\frac{\Delta\mathbf{v}}{\Delta t}\right)\), the average acceleration \(\overline{\mathbf{a}}\) + is perpendicular to \(\Delta\mathbf{r}\). If we place \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) on the line that bisects the angle between \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\) +, we see that it is directed towards the centre of the circle. Figure 4.19(b) shows the same quantities for smaller time interval. \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) and hence \(\overline{\mathbf{a}}\) is again directed towards the centre. In Fig. 4.19(c), \(\Delta t\to 0\) and the average acceleration becomes the instantaneous acceleration. It is directed towards the centre\({}^{\divide}\). Thus, we find that the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion is always directed towards the centre of the circle. Let us now find the magnitude of the acceleration.

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{a}\) is, by definition, given by

\[\left|\mathbf{a}\right|=\frac{lim}{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\left|\Delta \mathbf{v}\right|}{\Delta t}\]

Let the angle between position vectors \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\) + be \(\Delta\theta\). Since the velocity vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\) + always perpendicular to the position vectors, the angle between them is also \(\Delta\theta\) +. Therefore, the triangle CPP' formed by the position vectors and the triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\) + and \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) are similar (Fig. 4.19a). Therefore, the ratio of the base-length to side-length for one of the triangles is equal to that of the other triangle. That is :

\[\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|}{v}=\frac{\left|\Delta \mathbf{r}\right|}{R}\] \[\therefore\] \[\therefore\] \[\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|-v\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{r} \right|}{R}\]

Therefore, \(\left|\mathbf{a}\right|-\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\frac{\left|\Delta \mathbf{v}\right|}{\Delta t}-\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\frac{\left|\Delta \mathbf{r}\right|}{R\Delta t}-\frac{v}{R\Delta t}\underset{\Delta t\to 0}{lim}\frac{ \left|\Delta\mathbf{r}\right|}{\Delta t}\]

If \(\Delta t\) is small, \(\Delta\theta\) will also be small and then arc \(PP^{\prime}\) can be approximately taken to be \(\Delta\mathbf{r}\) +:

\[\left|\Delta\mathbf{r}\right|\equiv v\Delta t\] \[\therefore\] \[\Delta t\to 0\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{r}\right|}{\Delta t}-v\]

Footnote †: margin: _In the limit \(\Delta t\to 0\), \(\Delta\mathbf{r}\) becomes perpendicular to \(\mathbf{r}\). In this limit \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\to\)0 and is consequently also perpendicular to \(\mathbf{V}\). Therefore, the acceleration is directed towards the centre, at each point of the circular path._

Therefore, the centripetal acceleration \(a_{c}\) is :

\[\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|}{v}=\frac{\left|\Delta \mathbf{r}\right|}{R}\] \[\therefore\] \[\therefore\] \[\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|-v\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{r} \right|}{R}\]

Therefore, \(\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|-v\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{r}\right|}{R}\)

Therefore, \(\left|\Delta\mathbf{v}\right|-v\frac{\left|\Delta\mathbf{r}\right|}{R}\)
\[a_{c}=\ \ \left(\frac{v}{R}\right)v=v^{2}/R \tag{4.44}\]

Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with speed \(v\) in a circle of radius \(R\) has a magnitude \(v^{2}/R\) and is always **directed towards the centre**. This is why this acceleration is called **centripetal acceleration** (a term proposed by Newton). A thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was probably known to Newton also some years earlier. "Centripetal" comes from a Greek term which means 'centre-seeking". Since \(v\) and \(R\) are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes -- pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.

We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. As the object moves from P to P' in time \(\Delta t\) (= \(t^{\prime}-t\)), the line CP (Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle \(\Delta\theta\) as shown in the figure. \(\Delta\theta\) is called angular distance. We define the angular speed \(\omega\)(Greek letter omega) as the time rate of change of angular displacement :

\[\omega=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} \tag{4.45}\]

Now, if the distance travelled by the object during the time \(\Delta t\) is \(\Delta s\), i. e. \(PP^{\prime}\) is \(\Delta s\), then :

\[v=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}\]

but \(\Delta s=R\ \Delta\theta\). Therefore :

\[v=R\ \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=R\ \omega\]

\[v=R\ \omega \tag{4.46}\]

We can express centripetal acceleration \(a_{c}\) in terms of angular speed :

\[a_{c}=\frac{v^{2}}{R}=\frac{\omega^{2}R^{2}}{R}=\omega^{2}R \tag{4.47}\] \[a_{c}=\omega^{2}R\]

The time taken by an object to make one revolution is known as its time period \(T\) and the number of revolution made in one second is called its frequency \(v\) (=1/\(T\)). However, during this time the distance moved by the object is \(s=2\pi R\).

Therefore, \(v=2\pi R/T=2\pi Rv\)

In terms of frequency \(v\), we have

\[\omega=2\pi v \tag{4.48}\] \[v=2\pi Rv\] (4.49) \[a_{c}=4\pi^{2}v^{2}R\]

**Example 4.10**: An insect trapped in a circular groove of radius 12 cm moves along the groove steadily and completes 7 revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the angular speed, and the linear speed of the motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a constant vector? Whatis its magnitude?

_Answer_: This is an example of uniform circular motion. Here \(R=12\) cm. The angular speed is given by

\[\omega=2\pi/T=2\pi\times 7/100=0.44\ \mathrm{rad/s}\]

The linear speed \(v\) is :

\[v=\omega R=0.44\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\times 12\ \mathrm{cm}=5.3\ \mathrm{cm}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\]

The direction of velocity \(v\) is along the tangent to the circle at every point. The acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle. Since this direction changes continuously, acceleration here is _not_ a constant vector. However, the magnitude of acceleration is constant:

\[a=\omega\ \theta R=\{0.44\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\}^{2}\{12\ \mathrm{cm}\}\] \[=2.3\ \mathrm{cm}\ \mathrm{s}^{2}\]Summary

1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed, mass and temperature.
2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.
3. Ave as \(\Delta t\)tends to zero : \(\textbf{v}=\frac{\textbf{f}m}{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\textbf{Ar}}{\Delta t}=\frac{ \textbf{dr}}{\Delta t}\). It can be written in unit vector notation as : \(\textbf{v}-v_{x}\textbf{T}+v_{y}\textbf{T}+v_{x}\textbf{E}\) where \(v_{x}-\frac{\textbf{dx}}{\Delta t}\), \(v_{y}=\frac{\textbf{dy}}{\Delta t}\), \(v_{x}=\frac{\textbf{dz}}{\Delta t}\) When position of an object is plotted on a coordinate system, **v** is always tangent to the curve representing the path of the object.
14. If the velocity of an object changes from **v** to \(\textbf{v}^{\prime}\) in time \(\Delta t\), then its _average acceleration_ is given by: \(\overline{\textbf{a}}=\frac{\textbf{v}-\textbf{v}^{\prime}}{\Delta t}=\frac{ \Delta\textbf{v}}{\Delta t}\) The _acceleration_**a** at any time \(t\) is the limiting value of \(\overline{\textbf{a}}\) as \(\Delta t\to 0\) : \(\textbf{a}=\lim\limits_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta\textbf{v}}{\Delta t}=\frac{ \textbf{dv}}{\Delta t}\) In component form, we have \(:\textbf{a}-a_{x}\textbf{T}+a_{y}\textbf{T}+a_{z}\textbf{E}\) where, \(a_{x}=\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}\). \(a_{y}=\frac{dv_{y}}{dt}\). \(a_{x}=\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}\).
15. If an object is moving in a plane with constant acceleration \(a=\left|\textbf{a}\right|=\sqrt{a_{x}^{2}+a_{y}^{2}}\) and its position vector at time \(t=0\) is \(\textbf{r}_{y}\), then at any other time \(t\), it will be at a point given by:. \(\textbf{T}=\textbf{r}_{y}+\textbf{v}_{o}t+\frac{1}{2}\textbf{a}t^{2}\) and its velocity is given by : \(\textbf{v}=\textbf{v}_{o}+\textbf{a}\)\(t\) where \(\textbf{v}_{o}\) is the velocity at time \(t=0\) In component form : \(\textbf{x}=x_{o}+v_{ox}t+\frac{1}{2}\textbf{a}_{x}t^{2}\). \(\textbf{y}=\textbf{y}_{o}+v_{oy}t+\frac{1}{2}\textbf{a}_{y}t^{2}\). \(\textbf{v}_{x}-v_{ox}+a_{x}t\). \(\textbf{v}_{y}=v_{ox}+a_{y}t\). \(\textbf{v}_{y}=v_{ox}+a_{y}t\) _Motion in a plane can be treated as superposition of two separate simultaneous one-dimensional motions along two perpendicular directions_
16. An object that is in flight after being projected is called a _projectile_. If an object is projected with initial velocity \(\textbf{v}_{o}\) making an angle \(\theta_{o}\) with x-axis and if we assume its initial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position and velocity of the projectile at time \(t\) are given by : \(x=(v_{o}\cos\theta_{o})\)\(t\) \(y=(v_{o}\sin\theta_{o})\)\(t\) -(1/2) \(g\)\(\xi\) \(v_{x}=v_{ox}=v_{o}\cos\theta_{o}\) \(v_{y}=v_{o}\sin\theta_{o}\) The path of a projectile is _parabolic_ and is given by : \(y=(\tan\theta_{0})\)\(x-\frac{g\textbf{x}^{2}}{2\big{(}v_{o}\cos\theta_{o}\big{)}^{2}}\) The _maximum height_ that a projectile attains is :

**POINTS TO PONDER**

1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.
2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.
3. The vector equations (4.33a) and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course, you can always resolve them along any two independent axes.
4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its direction is changing.
5. An object subjected to two velocities \(\mathbf{v}_{z}\) and \(\mathbf{v}_{z}\) has a resultant velocity \(\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}_{z}+\mathbf{v}_{z}\). Take care to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : \(\mathbf{v}_{z}=\mathbf{v}_{z}-\mathbf{v}_{z}\). Here \(\mathbf{v}_{z}\) and \(\mathbf{v}_{z}\) are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.
6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if the speed is constant.
7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial velocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.

## Chapter 5 Laws of Motion

### 5.1 Introduction

In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question.

Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion.

In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. **This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces ) can exert force on a body even from a distance.**

In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body.

So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)? **Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?**

### Aristotle's Fallacy

The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science.

The Greek thinker. Aristotle (\(384\) B.C- \(322\) B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: **An external force is required to keep a body in motion**.

Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall see. However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience. Even a small child playing with a simple (non-electric) toy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs to constantly drag the string attached to the toy-car with some force to keep it going. If it releases the string, it comes to rest. This experience is common to most terrestrial motion. External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest.

What is the flaw in Aristotle's argument? The answer is; a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the floor. The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion.

The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for fluids) are always present in the natural world. This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong. He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument. To get at the true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing. This is what Galileo did.

### The Law of Inertia

Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity (Fig. 1(a)).

Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. Aball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height (a little less but never greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height.

If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 1(b)).

Figure 1: The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo from observations of motion of a ball on a double inclined plane.

In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated. However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.

Gallleo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him. The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion [motion with constant velocity] are equivalent. In both cases, there is accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.

Newton built on Galileo's ideas and laid the foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws of motion that go by his name. Galileo's law of inertia was his starting point which he formulated as the **First Law of motion**:

**Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise.**

#### Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science

Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potters rod strikes the wheel persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body: transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. A fallingal in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational and vibrational motion (bhirman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a definite (small) displacement. The was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (_talktalk goat_), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results from the transmission of vibrations of water particles.

#### The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration.

The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as:

**If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on thebody.**

Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice. In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero. In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it. Its acceleration, according to the First Law, must be zero. If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity.

## 6 Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642)

Galileo Galilei, born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientific revolution in Europe about four centuries ago. Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration. From experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely, he contradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in motion, and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity. He thus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent epochal work of Isaac Newton.

Galileo's discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary. In 1609, he designed his own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of startling observations : mountains and depressions on the surface of the moon; dark spots on the sun; the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. He concluded that the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye. In his masterpiece of scientific reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus, which eventually got universal acceptance.

With Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientific inquiry. Science was no longer merely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments to verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical relations between them. Not undeservedly, many regard Galileo as the father of modern science.

More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with. In that case, if we know that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer from the first law that the net external force on the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth. Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out i.e. add up to zero net external force.

Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface Fig. (11(a)). It is subject to two external forces : the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight \(W\)) acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force \(R\).\(R\) is a self-adjusting force. This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above. The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known. We observe the book to be at rest. Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of \(R\) equals that of \(W\). A statement often encountered is : "Since \(W\)=\(R\), forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest". This is incorrect rea soning. The correct statement is : "Since the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the first law. This implies that the normal force \(R\) must be equal and opposite to the weight \(W\)".

Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig. (11(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it. During pick-up, it accelerates. This must happen due to a net external force. Note, it has to be an external force. The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted for by any internal force. This might sound surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole. (You will learn a bout friction in section 5.9). When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force.

Figure 11: (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car moving with uniform velocity. The net force is zero in each case.

The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations. Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown backward with a jerk. Why? Our feet are in touch with the floor. If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the floor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us. However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the floor. If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus. But our body is not strictly a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts. What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward. As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body along with the bus. A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the floor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest.

An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter stellar space at a constant rate of 100 m s-2. What is the acceleration of the astronaut the instant after he is outside the spaceship? [Assume that there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him.]

Since there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him and the small spaceship exerts negligible gravitational attraction on him, the net force acting on the astronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is zero. By the first law of motion the acceleration of the astronaut is zero. 

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body.

Momentum

Momentum, **P** of a body is defined to be the product of its mass \(m\) and velocity **v**, and is denoted by **p**:

\[\textbf{p}=m\,\textbf{v} \tag{5.1}\]

Momentum is clearly a vector quantity. The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion.

* Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time. Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed.
* If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the ground will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone. The mass of a body is thus an important parameter that determines the effect of force onits motion.
* Speed is another important parameter to consider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting in casualty. The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage. Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time. Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion. The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied.
* A seasoned cricket catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the act. One reason is that the cricket allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball (Fig. 5.3). The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a much greater force to stop the ball instantly, and 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:94]

\[\mathbf{F}=k\,\frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{d}t} \tag{5.2}\]

For a body of fixed mass \(m\),

\[\frac{\cdot}{\frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{d}t}}\,=\,\frac{ \mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{d}t}(m\,\mathbf{v})\,=\,m\,\frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{v}}{ \mathbf{d}t}\,=\,m\,\mathbf{a} \tag{5.3}\]

i.e the Second Law can also be written as

\[\mathbf{F}\,=\,\,k\,\,m\,\mathbf{a} \tag{5.4}\]

which shows that force is proportional to the product of mass \(m\) and acceleration \(\mathbf{a}\).

The unit of force has not been defined so far. In fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to define the unit of force. We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any constant value for \(k\). For simplicity, we choose \(k=1\), The Second Law then is

\[\mathbf{F}=\frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{d}t}\,=\,m\mathbf{a} \tag{5.5}\]

In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration of \(1\) m s\({}^{2}\) to a mass of \(1\) kg. This unit is known as **newton** : \(1\) N = \(1\) kg m s\({}^{2}\).

Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law :

1. In the second law, \(\mathbf{F}=0\) implies \(\mathbf{a}=0\). The second Law is obviously consistent with the first law.
2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is equivalent to three equations, one for each component of the vectors : \[F_{x}=\frac{\mathbf{d}p_{x}}{\mathbf{d}t}=ma_{x}\] \[F_{y}=\frac{\mathbf{d}p_{y}}{\mathbf{d}t}=ma_{y}\] \[F_{x}=\frac{\mathbf{d}p_{x}}{\mathbf{d}t}m\,\alpha_{x}\] (5.6)

This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force. The component of velocity normal to the force remains unchanged. For example, in the motion of a projectile under the vertical gravitational force, the horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).
3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is applicable to a single point particle. The force \(\mathbf{F}\) in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and \(\mathbf{a}\) stands for acceleration of the particle. It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles. In that case, \(\mathbf{F}\) refers to the total external force on the system and \(\mathbf{a}\) refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole. More precisely, \(\mathbf{a}\) is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system. **Any internal forces in the system are not to be included in \(\mathbf{F}\)**.
4. The second law of motion is a local relation which means that force \(\mathbf{F}\) at a point in space (location of the particle) at a certain instant of time is related to \(\mathbf{a}\) at that point at that instant. Acceleration here and now is determined by the force here and now, **not by any history of the motion of the particle (See Fig. 5.5)**.

**Example 5.2**: A bullet of mass \(0.04\) kg moving with a speed of \(90\) m s\({}^{-1}\) enters a heavy wooden block and is stopped after a distance of \(60\) cm. What is the average resistive force exerted by the block on the bullet?

_Answer_ **The retardation '\(a\)' of the bullet (assumed constant) is given by**

\[a=\frac{-\,u^{2}}{2\mathbf{s}}=\frac{-\,90\times 90}{2\times 0.6}\,\mathbf{m }\,\mathbf{s}^{-2}=-\,6750\,\mathbf{m}\,\mathbf{s}^{-2}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:96]

always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces between two bodies are always equal and opposite. This idea was expressed by Newton in the form of the third law of motion.

**To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.**

Newton's wording of the third law is so crisp and beautiful that it has become a part of common language. For the same reason perhaps, misconceptions about the third law abound. Let us note some important points about the third law, particularly in regard to the usage of the terms : action and reaction.

1. The terms action and reaction in the third law mean nothing else but 'force'. Using different terms for the same physical concept can sometimes be confusing. A simple and clear way of stating the third law is as follows :

**Forces always occur in pairs. Force on a body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.**
2. The terms action and reaction in the third law may give a wrong impression that action comes before reaction i.e action is the cause and reaction the effect. **There is no cause-effect relation implied in the third law. The force on \(A\) by \(B\) and the force on \(B\) by \(A\) act at the same instant.** By the same reasoning, any one of them may be called action and the other reaction.
3. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. According to the third law, \[\mathbf{F}_{AB}=-\mathbf{F}_{BA}\] (5.8) (force on \(A\) by \(B\)) = - (force on \(B\) by \(A\)) Thus if we are considering the motion of any one body (\(A\) or \(B\)), only one of the two forces is relevant. It is an error to add up the two forces and claim that the net force is zero.

However, if you are considering the system of two bodies as a whole, \(\mathbf{F}_{AB}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{BA}\) are internal forces of the system \(\{A+B\}\). They add up to give a null force. Internal forces in a body or a system of particles thus cancel away in pairs. This is an important fact that enables the second law to be applicable to a body or a system of particles (See Chapter 7).

Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe. England in 1642, the year Galileo died. His extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden from others in his school life. In 1662, he went to Cambridge for undergraduate studies. A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton had to return to his mother's farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant creativity blossomed in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and physics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents, the beginning of calculus, the inverse square law of gravitation, the spectrum of white light, and so on. Returning to Cambridge, he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a reflecting telescope.

In 1684, encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley, Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of the greatest scientific works ever published : The Principia Mathematica. In it, he enunciated the three laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, which explained all the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The book was packed with a host of path-breaking achievements : basic principles of fluid mechanics, mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth, the sun and other planets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes, theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out another masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour.

The scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo was brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics unified terrestrial and celestial phenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the motion of the moon around the earth. The age of reason had dawned.

_Answer_ Figures 5.8(b) and 5.8(c) are known as a free-body diagrams. Figure 5.8(b) is the free-body diagram of W and Fig. 5.8(c) is the free-body diagram of point P.

Consider the equilibrium of the weight W. Clearly.\(T_{{}_{2}}=6\times 10=60\) N.

Consider the equilibrium of the point P under the action of three forces - the tensions \(T_{{}_{1}}\) and \(T_{{}_{2}}\), and the horizontal force 50 N. The horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force must vanish separately :

\(T_{{}_{1}}\ \cos\ \theta=T_{{}_{2}}=60\) N

\(T_{{}_{1}}\ \sin\ \theta=50\) N

which gives that

\(\tan\theta=\frac{5}{6}\) or \(\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)=40\)*

Note the answer does not depend on the length of the rope (assumed massless) nor on the point at which the horizontal force is applied. \(\triangleleft\)

### Common Forces in Mechanics

In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of forces. The gravitational force is, of course, all pervasive. Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies. The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium.

All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in contact (e.g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and other types of supports), there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law. The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction. The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with fluids. For example, for a solid immersed in a fluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces [Fig. 5.9].

Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring. When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force. a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or elongation (for small displacements). The spring force \(F\) is written as \(F=-k\ x\) where \(x\) is the displacement and \(k\) is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state. For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high. The restoring force in a string is called tension. It is customary to use a constant tension \(T\) throughout the string. This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass.

In Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four fundamental forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here. Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics. The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces. This may seem surprising

Figure 5.9: Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.

since we are talking of uncharged and non-magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic level, all bodies are made of charged constituents (nuclei and electrons) and the various contact forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be traced to the electrical forces between the charged constituents of different bodies. The detailed microscopic origin of these forces is, however, complex and not useful for handling problems in mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why they are treated as different types of forces with their characteristic properties determined empirically.

#### 5.9.1 Friction

Let us return to the example of a body of mass m at rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity (_mg_) is cancelled by the normal reaction force (N) of the table. Now suppose a force \(F\) is applied horizontally to the body. We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body. But if the applied force \(F\) were the only external force on the body, it must move with acceleration \(F/m\), however small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because some other force comes into play in the horizontal direction and opposes the applied force \(F\), resulting in zero net force on the body. This force\(f_{s}\) parallel to the surface of the body in contact with the table is known as frictional force, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)). The subscript stands for static friction to distinguish it from kinetic friction \(f_{s}\) that we consider later (Fig. 5.10(b)). Note that static friction does not exist by itself. When there is no applied force, there is no static friction. It comes into play the moment there is an applied force. As the applied force \(F\) increases, \(f_{s}\) also increases, remaining equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it is called static friction. Static friction opposes impending motion. The term impending motion means motion that would take place (but does not actually take place) under the applied force, if friction were absent.

We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move. It is found experimentally that the limiting value of static friction \(\left(f_{s}\right)_{\text{max}}\) is independent of the area of contact and varies with the normal force(_N_) approximately as :

\[\left(f_{s}\right)_{\text{max}}=\mu_{s}\text{N} \tag{5.13}\]

where \(\mu_{s}\) is a constant of proportionality depending only on the nature of the surfaces in contact. The constant \(\mu_{s}\) is called the coefficient of static friction. The law of static friction may thus be written as

\[f_{s}\leq\mu_{s}\text{ N} \tag{5.14}\]

If the applied force \(F\) exceeds \(\left(f_{s}\right)_{\text{max}}\) the body begins to slide on the surface. It is found experimentally that when relative motion has started, the frictional force decreases from the static maximum value \(\left(f_{s}\right)_{\text{max}}\). Frictional force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is denoted by \(f_{s}\). Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static friction:

\[f_{k}=\mu_{k}\text{N} \tag{5.15}\]

where \(\mu_{k}\) the coefficient of kinetic friction, depends only on the surfaces in contact. As mentioned above, experiments show that \(\mu_{k}\) is less than \(\mu_{s}\). When relative motion has begun, the acceleration of the body according to the Second Law is \((F-f_{k})/m\). For a body moving with constant velocity, \(F=f_{k}\). If the applied force on the body is removed, its acceleration is \(-f_{k}/m\) and it eventually comes to a stop.

The laws of friction given above do not have the status of fundamental laws like those for gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They are empirical relations that are only approximately true. Yet they are very useful in practical calculations in mechanics.

Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each experiences a contact force by the other. Friction, by definition, is the component of the contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes impending or actual relative motion between the two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but **relative motion** that the frictional force opposes. Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train that is accelerating. If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train. What forces cause the acceleration of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If there were no friction, the floor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial position due to inertia (and hit the back side of the train). This impending relative motion is opposed by the static friction \(f_{s}\). Static friction provides the same acceleration to the box as that of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the train.

**Example 5.7**: Determine the maximum acceleration of the train in which a box lying on its floor will remain stationary, given that the co-efficient of static friction between the box and the train's floor is \(0.15\).

**Example 5.8**: See Fig. 5.11. A mass of \(4\,\mathrm{kg}\) rests on a horizontal plane. The plane is gradually inclined until at an angle \(\theta=15^{\circ}\) with the horizontal, the mass just begins to slide. What is the coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface?

**Answer**: The forces acting on a block of mass \(m\) at rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight \(m\,\mathrm{g}\) acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal force \(N\) of the plane on the block, and (iii) the static frictional force \(f_{s}\) opposing the impending motion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these forces must be zero. Resolving the weight \(m\,\mathrm{g}\) along the two directions shown, we have

\(m\,\mathrm{g}\,\sin\theta=f_{s}\), \(m\,\mathrm{g}\,\cos\theta=N\)

As \(\theta\) increases, the self-adjusting frictional force \(f_{s}\) increases until at \(\theta=\theta_{max}\), \(f_{s}\) achieves its maximum value. \(\left\langle f_{s}\right\rangle_{\mathrm{max}}=\mu_{s}\,N\).

Therefore,

\(\tan\,\theta_{max}=\mu_{s}\) or \(\theta_{max}=\tan^{-1}\,\mu_{s}\)

When \(\theta\) becomes just a little more than \(\theta_{max}\). there is a small net force on the block and it begins to slide. Note that \(\theta_{max}\) depends only on \(\mu_{s}\) and is independent of the mass of the block.

**For \(\theta_{max}=15^{\circ}\)**,

\(\mu_{s}=\tan 15^{\circ}\)

**Example 5.9**: What is the acceleration of the block and trolley system shown in a Fig. 5.12(a), if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the trolley and the surface is \(0.04\)? What is the tension in the string? (Take g=10 m s\({}^{2}\)). Neglect the mass of the string.

_Answer_ As the string is inextensible, and the pully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg trolley both have same magnitude of acceleration. Applying second law to motion of the block (Fig. 5.12(b)).

\(30-T=3a\)

Apply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig. 5.12(c)).

\(T-f_{k}=20a\)

Now \(\int_{k}=\mu_{k}N\).

Here \(\mu_{k}=0.04\).

\(N=20\) x 10

\(=200\) N.

Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is \(T-0.04\) x 2 00 = 20\(a\) Or \(T-8=20a\).

These equations give \(a\stackrel{{\mbox{\small-2.2}}}{{=}}\frac{22}{23}\) m s\({}^{-2}=0.96\) m s\({}^{-2}\) and \(T=27.1\) N. \(\triangleleft\)

_Rolling friction_

A body like a ring or a sphere rolling without slipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no friction. In principle. At every instant. there is just one point of contact between the body and the plane and this point has no motion relative to the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or static friction is zero and the body should continue to roll with constant velocity. We know, in practice, this will not happen and some resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur, i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This is the reason why discovery of the wheel has been a major milestone in human history.

Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area (not a point) of the body being in contact with the surface. The net effect is that the component of the contact force parallel to the surface opposes motion.

We often regard friction as something undesirable. In many situations. like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role. It opposes relative motion and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a machine. (Fig. 5.13(a)) Since the rolling friction between ball bearings and the surfaces in contact is very small, power dissipation is reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative motion is another effective way of reducing friction (Fig. 5.13(a)).

In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed. Kinetic friction that dissipates power is nevertheless important for quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles. Similarly, static friction is important in daily life. We are able to walk be cause of friction. It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road. On an ordinary road, the friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary external force to accelerate the car.

Figure 5.13: Some ways of reducing friction. (a) Ball bearings placed between moving parts of a machine. (b) Compressed cushion of air betweer surfaces in relative motion.

### Circular Motion

We have seen in Chapter 4 that acceleration of a body moving in a circle of radius \(R\) with uniform speed \(v\) is \(v^{2}/R\) directed towards the centre. According to the second law, the force \(f\) providing this acceleration is :

\[f=\frac{mv^{2}}{R} \tag{5.16}\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the body. This force directed forwards the centre is called the centripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle by a string, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. The centripetal force for motion of a planet around the sun is the

gravitational force on the planet due to the sun. For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal road, the centripetal force is the force of friction.

The circular motion of a car on a flat and banked road give interesting application of the laws of motion.

**Motion of a car on a level road**

Three forces act on the car. (Fig. 5.14(a)

(i) The weight of the car, \(mg\)

(ii) Normal reaction, \(N\)

(iii) Frictional force,\(f\)

As there is no acceleration in the vertical direction

\(N\)-\(mg=0\)

\(N\)= \(mg\)

The centripetal force required for circular motion is along the surface of the road, and is provided by the component of the contact force between road and the car types along the surface. This by definition is the frictional force. Note that it is the static friction that provides the centripetal acceleration. Static friction opposes the impending motion of the car moving away from the circle. Using equation (5.14) & (5.16) we get the result

\[f\leq\mu_{s}N=\frac{mv^{2}}{R}\]

\[v^{2}\leq\frac{\mu_{s}RN}{m}=\mu_{s}Rg\]

\[[\mathbf{Q}\,N=mg|\]

which is independent of the mass of the car.

This shows that for a given value of \(\mu_{s}\) and \(R\), there is a maximum speed of circular motion of the car possible, namely

\[v_{\max}=\sqrt{\mu_{s}Rg} \tag{5.18}\]

### Motion of a car on a banked road

We can reduce the contribution of friction to the circular motion of the car if the road is banked (Fig. 5.14(b)). Since there is no acceleration along the vertical direction, the net force along this direction must be zero. Hence,

\[N\cos\dot{\theta}=mg+f\sin\dot{\theta}\] (5.19a) The centripetal force is provided by the horizontal components of \[N\,\mathrm{and}\,f\]. \[N\,\mathrm{sin}\,\dot{\theta}+f\cos\dot{\theta}=\frac{mv^{2}}{R}\] (5.20a) \[\mathrm{But}\,f\dot{\leq}\mu_{s}N\] Thus to obtain \[v_{max}\] we put \[\dot{f}=\mu_{s}N\].

Then Eqs. (5.19) & (5.20) become

\[N\cos\dot{\theta}=mg+\dot{\mu}_{s}N\ \sin\dot{\theta} \tag{5.19b}\]

Figure 5.14: Circular motion of a car on (a) a level road, (b) a banked road.

directed upwards (not shown in the figure). (ii) the force on the floor by the system (action); the force on the system by the floor (reaction). In addition, for (b), the force on the block by the cylinder and the force on the cylinder by the block also constitute an action-reaction pair.

The important thing to remember is that an action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces which are always equal and opposite between two bodies. Two forces on the same body which happen to be equal and opposite can never constitute an action-reaction pair. The force of gravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal force on the mass by the floor are not action-reaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal and opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest. They are not so for case (b), as seen already. The weight of the system is 270 N, while the normal force \(R^{\prime}\) is 267.3 N. 

The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is of great help in solving problems in mechanics. It allows you to clearly define your system and consider all forces on the system due to objects that are not part of the system itself. A number of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will help you cultivate this practice.

SUMMARY

1. Aristotle's view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.
2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton's first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: "_E everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless completely by some external force to act otherwise_". In simple terms, the First Law is "_If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero_".
3. Momentum (p) of a body is the product of its mass (\(m\)) and velocity (\(\mathbf{v}\)) : \(\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}\)
4. Newton's second law of motion : _The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts._ Thus \[\mathbf{F}-k\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}-k\,m\,\mathbf{a}\] where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the net external force on the body and \(\mathbf{a}\) its acceleration. We set the constant of proportionality \(k=1\) in S.I. Then \[\mathbf{F}-\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}-m\mathbf{a}\] The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2. 1. The second law is consistent with the First Law (\(\mathbf{F}=0\) implies \(\mathbf{a}=0\)) 2. It is a vector equation 3. It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided \(\mathbf{F}\) is the total external force on the system and \(\mathbf{a}\) is the acceleration of the system as a whole. 4. \(\mathbf{F}\) at a point at a certain instant determines \(\mathbf{a}\) at the same point at that instant. That is the Second Law is a local law: \(\mathbf{a}\) at an instant does not depend on the history of motion. 5. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short, one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the impulsive force. 6. Newton's third law of motion: _To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction_In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : _Forces in nature evaluays occur between pairs of bodies. Force on body A by body B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A._ Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.
7. _Law of Conservation of Momentum_ The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law follows from the second and third law of motion.
8. _Friction_ Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction \(f_{i}\) opposes impending relative motion; kinetic friction \(f_{k}\) opposes actual relative motion. They are independent of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws : \[\cdot\] \[f_{\mathbf{S}}\leq\left(f_{\mathbf{S}}\right)_{\text{max}}-\mu_{\mathbf{S}}R\] \[f_{\mathbf{k}}=\mu_{\mathbf{k}}R\] \[\mu_{k}\] (co-efficient of static friction) and \[\mu_{k}\] (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact. It is found experimentally that \[\mu_{k}\] is less than \[\mu_{k}\].

POINTS TO PODER

Force is not always in the direction of motion. Depending on the situation, \(\mathbf{F}\) may be along \(\mathbf{v}\), opposite to \(\mathbf{v}\), normal to \(\mathbf{v}\) or may make some other angle with \(\mathbf{v}\). In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.

If \(\mathbf{v}=0\) at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant. For example, when a ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, \(\mathbf{v}=0\) but the force continues to be its weight \(mg\) and the acceleration is not zero but \(g\).

Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of the body at that time. Force is not 'carried' by the body from its earlier history of motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.

In the second law of motion \(\mathbf{F}=m\,\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{F}\) stands for the net force due to all material agencies external to the body. \(\mathbf{a}\) is the effect of the force. \(m\) should not be regarded as yet another force, besides \(\mathbf{F}\).
* The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like tension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force in any circular motion.
* Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit \(\mu_{s}\)_N_(_f_,_g_u_, _N_). Do not put \(J_{s}\)=\(\mu_{s}\)_N_ without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming into play.
* The familiar equation \(mg\)= \(R\) for a body on a table is true only if the body is in equilibrium. The two forces \(mg\) and \(R\) can be different (e.g, a body in an accelerated lift). The equality of \(mg\) and \(R\) has no connection with the third law.
* The terms 'action' and'reaction' in the third Law of Motion simply stand for simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in ordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies.
* The different terms like 'friction', 'normal reaction' 'tension', 'air resistance', 'viscous drag', 'thrust', 'buoyancy'weight' 'centripetal force' all stand for 'force' in different contexts. For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase 'force on \(A\) by \(B\)'.
* For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between inanimate and animate objects. An animate object such as a human also requires an external force to accelerate. For example, without the external force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.
* The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the subjective concept of the 'feeling of force'. On a merry-go-around, all parts of our body are subject to an inward force. but we have a feeling of being pushed outward-the direction of impending motion.

## Chapter 6 Work, Energy and Power

### 6.1 Introduction

The terms 'work', 'energy' and 'power' are frequently used in everyday language. A farmer ploughing the field, a construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, the word 'Work' covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term 'energy' is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term 'work' itself is defined much more precisely. The word 'power' is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In karate or boxing we talk of 'powerful' punches. These are delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word 'power' used in physics. We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors.

#### 6.1.1 The Scalar Product

We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4. Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or dot product of any two vectors **A** and **B**, denoted as **A**:**B (readA dotB) is defined as

\[\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}=AB\cos\theta \tag{6.1a}\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors as shown in Fig. 6.1a. Since \(A\), \(B\) and \(\cos\theta\) are scalars, the dot product of **A** and **B** is a scalar quantity. Each vector, **A** and **B**, has a direction but their scalar product does not have a direction.

From Eq. (6.1a), we have

\[\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}=A\left(B\cos\theta\right)\] \[=B\left(A\cos\theta\right)\]

Geometrically, \(B\cos\theta\)is the projection of **B** onto **A** in Fig.6.1 (b) and \(A\cos\theta\) is the projection of **A** onto **B** in Fig. 6.1 (c). So, **A**-**B** is the product of the magnitude of **A** and the component of **B** along **A**. Alternatively, it is the product of the magnitude of **B** and the component of **A** along **B**.

Equation (6.1a) shows that the scalar product follows the commutative law :

\[\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}=\textbf{B}\cdot\textbf{A}\]

Scalar product obeys the distributive law:

\[\textbf{A}\cdot\left(\textbf{B}+\textbf{C}\right)=\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}+ \textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{C}\]

Further, \(\textbf{A}\cdot\left(\lambda\textbf{B}\right)=\lambda\) (**A**-**B**)

where \(\lambda\) is a real number.

The proofs of the above equations are left to you as an exercise.

For unit vectors \(\textbf{f}\cdot\textbf{j}\cdot\textbf{k}\) we have

\[\textbf{i}\cdot\textbf{i}\cdot\textbf{i}=\textbf{j}\cdot\textbf{j}=\textbf{k} \cdot\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{k}=1\]

\[\textbf{i}\cdot\textbf{j}=\textbf{j}\cdot\textbf{k}=\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{k} \cdot\textbf{f}=0\]

Given two vectors

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\textbf{A}=A_{x}\textbf{i}\textbf{i}+A_{y}\textbf{j} \textbf{i}+A_{x}\textbf{k}\\ \cdot\textbf{B}=B_{x}\textbf{i}\textbf{i}\textbf{i}+B_{y}\textbf{j}\textbf{i} +B_{x}\textbf{k}\\ \cdot\end{array}\]

their scalar product is

\[\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}=\left(A_{x}\textbf{i}+A_{y}\textbf{j}+A_{x}\textbf{k }\right)\cdot\left(B_{x}\textbf{i}+B_{y}\textbf{j}+B_{x}\textbf{k}\right)\]

\[\doteq A_{x}B_{x}+A_{y}B_{y}+A_{x}B_{x} \tag{6.1b}\]

From the definition of scalar product and, [Eq. 6.1b) we have :

\[\left\{\textbf{i}\right\}\cdot\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{A}=A_{x}A_{x}+A_{y}A_{y}+ A_{x}A_{x}\]

Or, \(\textbf{A}^{2}=A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+A_{x}^{2}\)

since \(\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{A}=\textbf{1}\textbf{A}\ \textbf{1}\textbf{A}\ \textbf{1}\cos 0=A^{2}\).

(ii) \(\textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}=0\), if **A** and **B** are perpendicular.

_Example 6.1_: Find the angle between force \(\textbf{F}=\left\{3\ \hat{1}+4\ \hat{j}\

### Notons of Work and Kinetic Energy: The Work-Energy Theorem

The following relation for rectilinear motion under constant acceleration \(a\) has been encountered in Chapter 3.

\[v^{2}-u^{2}=2\ as\]

where \(u\) and \(v\) are the initial and final speeds and \(s\) the distance traversed. Multiplying both sides by \(m/2\). we have

\[\dot{\frac{1}{2}}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}=mas=Fs\] (2a) where the last step follows from Newton's Second Law. We can generalise Eq. ( 11 ) to three dimensions by employing vectors \[v^{2}-u^{2}=2\ a.d\]

Once again multiplying both sides by \(m/2\). we obtain

\[\dot{\frac{1}{2}}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}=m\,ad=F\,d \tag{2b}\]

The above equation provides a motivation for the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The left side of the equation is the difference in the quantity 'half the mass times the square of the speed' from its initial value to its final value. We call each of these quantities the 'kinetic energy'. denoted by \(K\). The right side is a product of the displacement and the component of the force along the displacement. This quantity is called 'work' and is denoted by \(W\). Eq. (21 ) is then

\[K_{f}-K_{i}=W \tag{23}\]

where \(K_{i}\) and \(K_{f}\) are respectively the initial and final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers to the force and the displacement over which it acts. **Work is done by a force on the body over a certain displacement.**

Equation (22 ) is also a special case of the work-energy (WE) theorem : **The change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done on it by the net force.** We shall generalise the above derivation to a varying force in a later section.

It is well known that a raindrop falls under the influence of the downward gravitational force and the opposing resistive force. The latter is known to be proportional to the speed of the drop but is otherwise undetermined. Consider a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height 1.00 km. It hits the ground with a speed of 50.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). (a) What is the work done by the gravitational force? What is the work done by the unknown resistive force?

_Answer_ (a) The change in kinetic energy of the drop is \[\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}\,m\,v^{2}-0\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\times 10^{-3}\times 50\times 50\] \[=1.25\,J\]

where we have assumed that the drop is initially at rest.

Assuming that \(g\) is a constant with a value 10 m/s\({}^{2}\), the work done by the gravitational force is,

\[\begin{array}{l}W_{g}=mgh\\ =10^{-3}\times 10\times 10^{3}\\ =10.0\,J\end{array}\]

(b) From the work-energy theorem

\[\dot{\Delta K}=W_{g}+W_{r}\]

where \(W_{r}\) is the work done by the resistive force on the raindrop. Thus

\[\begin{array}{l}W_{r}=\Delta K-W_{g}\\ =1.25\,-\,0\\ =-8.75\,J\end{array}\]

is negative. 

### Work

As seen earlier. work is related to force and the displacement over which it acts. Consider a constant force \(F\) acting on an object of mass \(m\). The object undergoes a displacement \(d\) in the positive \(x\)-direction as shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: An object undergoes a displacement \(d\) under the influence of the force \(F\).

**The work done by the force is defined to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.** Thus

\[W=\{F\cos\theta\}d=F.d \tag{6.4}\]

We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large. Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet your muscles are alternatively contracting and relaxing and internal energy is being used up and you do get tired. Thus, the meaning of work in physics is different from its usage in everyday language.

No work is done if :

(1) the displacement is zero as seen in the example above. A weightfilter holding a 150 kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s does no work on the load during this time. (2) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth horizontal table is not acted upon by a horizontal force (since there is no friction), but may undergo a large displacement. (3) the force and displacement are mutually perpendicular. This is so since, for \(\theta=\pi/2\) rad (= 90\({}^{o}\)), \(\cos\{\pi/2\}=0\). For the block moving on a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational force \(mg\) does no work since it acts at right angles to the displacement. If we assume that the moon's orbits around the earth is perfectly circular then the earth's gravitational force does no work. The moon's instantaneous displacement is tangential while the earth's force is radially inwards and \(\theta=\pi/2\).

Work can be both positive and negative. If \(\theta\) is between 0\({}^{o}\) and 90\({}^{o}\), \(\cos\theta\) in Eq. (6.4) is positive. If \(\theta\) is between 90\({}^{o}\) and 180\({}^{o}\), \(\cos\theta\) is negative. In many examples the frictional force opposes displacement and \(\theta=180^{o}\). Then the work done by friction is negative (\(\cos 180^{o}=-1\)).

From Eq. (6.4) it is clear that work and energy have the same dimensions. [MLT\({}^{-2}\)]. The SI unit of these isjoule (J), named after the famous British physicistJames PrescottJoule [1811-1869]. Since work and energy are so widely used as physical concepts, alternative units abound and some of these are listed in Table 6.1.

**Example 6.3**: A cyclist comes toa skidding stop in 10 m. During this process, the force on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and is directly opposed to the motion. (a) How much work does the road do on the cycle? (b) How much work does the cycle do on the road?

_Answer_ **Work done on the cycle by the road is the work done by the stopping (frictional) force on the cycle due to the road.**

(a) The stopping force and the displacement make an angle of 180\({}^{o}\) (\(\pi\) rad) with each other. Thus, work done by the road,

\[W_{r}=Fd\cos\theta\] \[=200\times 10\times\cos\pi\] \[=-2000\,\mathrm{J}\] It is this negative work that brings the cycle to a halt in accordance with WE theorem. (b) From Newton's Third Law an equal and opposite force acts on the road due to the cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the road undergoes no displacement. Thus, work done by cycle on the road is zero. \(\dashv\)

The lesson of this example is that though the force on a body A exerted by the body B is always equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton's Third Law); the work done on A by B is not necessarily equal and opposite to the work done on B by A.

### Kinetic Energy

As noted earlier, if an object of mass \(m\) has velocity **v**, its kinetic energy \(K\) is

\[K\ =\ \frac{1}{2}m\,\textbf{v}.\textbf{v}\ =\ \frac{1}{2}m\,\textbf{v}\,^{2} \tag{6.5}\]

Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic energy of an object is a measure of the work an

### The Work-Energy Theorem for Variable Force

We are now familiar with the concepts of work and kinetic energy to prove the work-energy theorem for a variable force. We confine ourselves to one dimension. The time rate of change of kinetic energy is

\[\begin{split}\frac{\mathrm{d}K}{\mathrm{d}t}&= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{1}{2}m\,v^{2}\right)\\ &\cdot\\ &=m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\,v\\ &\cdot=F\,v\,\,\,\text{(from Newton's Second Law)}\\ &\cdot\\ &=F\,\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}\end{split}\]

Thus

\[\mathrm{d}K=F\mathrm{d}x\]

Integrating from the initial position \((x_{{}_{i}})\) to final position \((x_{{}_{f}})\), we have

\[\int\limits_{x_{{}_{1}}}^{x_{{}_{f}}}\mathrm{d}K=\int\limits_{x_{{}_{i}}}^{x_ {{}_{f}}}\mathrm{d}x\]

where, \(K_{{}_{1}}\) and \(K_{{}_{f}}\) are the initial and final kinetic energies corresponding to \(x_{{}_{i}}\) and \(x_{{}_{f}}\).

\[\text{or}\qquad K_{{}_{f}}-K_{{}_{i}}=\int\limits_{x_{{}_{i}}}^{x_{{}_{f}}} \mathrm{d}x\] (6.8a) From Eq. ( 6.7 ), it follows that

\[K_{{}_{f}}-K_{{}_{1}}=W \tag{6.8b}\]

Thus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable force.

While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the complete dynamical information of Newton's Second Law. It is an integral form of Newton's second law. Newton's second law is a relation between acceleration and force at any instant of time. Work-energy theorem involves an integral over an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal (time) information on contained in the statement of Newton's second law is 'integrated over' and is

(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we find that for \(\Delta x\to 0\), the area under the curve is exactly equal to the work done by \(F[x]\).

not available explicitly. Another observation is that Newton's second law for two or three dimensions is in vector form whereas the work-energy theorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form, information with respect to directions contained in Newton's second law is not present._

**Example 6.6**: A block of mass \(m=1\) kg, moving on a horizontal surface with speed \(v_{i}=2\) ms-1 enters a rough patch ranging from \(x=0.10\) m to \(x=2.01\) m. The retarding force \(F_{r}\) on the block in this range is inversely proportional to \(x\) over this range,

\[F_{r}=\frac{-k}{x}\text{ for }0.1<x<2.01\text{ m}\]

\[=0\text{ for }x<0.1\text{ m and }x>2.01\text{ m}\]

where \(k=0.5\text{ J}\). What is the final kinetic energy and speed \(v_{j}\) of the block as it crosses this patch?

_Answer_: From Eq. (6.8a)

\[\begin{split}&\quad\cdot\\ &\quad\cdot\\ &\quad=\frac{1}{2}\,m_{i}^{2}-k\,\ln\left(x\right)\big{|}_{0.1}^{2.0.1}\\ &\quad\cdot\\ &\quad=\frac{1}{2}\,m_{i}^{2}-k\,\ln\left(2.01/0.1\right)\\ &\quad=2\,-0.5\,\ln\left(20.1\right)\\ &\quad=2\,-1.5\,=0.5\text{ J}\\ &\quad\cdot\\ v_{f}=\sqrt{2K_{f}/m}=1\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}\end{split}\]

Here, note that \(\ln\) is a symbol for the natural logarithm to the base \(e\) and not the logarithm to the base \(10\) [\(\ln X=\log_{x}X=2.303\,\log_{10}X\)]. \(\triangleleft\)

### The Concept of Potential Energy

The word potential suggests possibility or capacity for action. The term potential energy brings to one's mind'stored' energy. A stretched bow-string possesses potential energy. When it is released, the arrow flies off at a great speed. The earth's crust is not uniform, but has discontinuities and dislocations that are called fault lines. These fault lines in the earth's crust are like 'compressed springs'. They possess a large amount of potential energy. An earthquake results when these fault lines readjust. Thus, potential energy is the'stored energy' by virtue of the position or configuration of a body. The body left to itself releases this stored energy in the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion of potential energy more concrete.

The gravitational force on a ball of mass \(m\) is \(mg\). \(g\)may be treated as a constant near the earth surface. By 'near' we imply that the height \(h\) of the ball above the earth's surface is very small compared to the earth's radius \(R_{e}\)[\(h\)<\(R_{e}\)] so that we can ignore the variation of \(g\) near the earth's surface1. In what follows we have taken the upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the ball up to a height \(h\). The work done by the external agency against the gravitational force is \(mgh\). This work gets stored as potential energy. Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a function of the height \(h\), is denoted by \(V(h)\) and it is the negative of work done by the gravitational force in raising the object to that height.

Footnote 1: The variation of \(g\) with height is discussed in Chapter 8 on Gravitation.

\[V(h)=mgh\]

If \(h\) is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that the gravitational force \(F\) equals the negative of the derivative of \(V(h)\) with respect to \(h\). Thus,

\[F=-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}h}V(h)=-m\,g\]

The negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is downward. When released, the ball comes down with an increasing speed. Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given by the kinematic relation,

\[v^{2}=2gh\]

This equation can be written as

\[\frac{\text{1}}{\text{2}}\,m\,v^{2}=m\,g\,h\]

which shows that the gravitational potential energy of the object at height \(h\), when the object is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of the object on reaching the ground.

Physically, the notion of potential energy is applicable only to the class of forces where work done against the force gets'stored up' as energy. When external constraints are removed, it manifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically, (for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential energy \(V(x)\) is defined if the force \(F(x)\) can be written as

\[F(x)=-\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}x}\]

This implies that

\[\int\limits_{x}^{x}F(x)\mathrm{d}x=-\int\limits_{x_{i}}^{V_{i}}\mathrm{d}V=V_{i} -V_{f}\]

The work done by a conservative force such as gravity depends on the initial and final positions only. In the previous chapter we have worked on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an object of mass \(m\)is released from rest, from the top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of height \(h\), its speed at the bottom is \(\sqrt[3]{2gh}\) irrespective of the angle of inclination. Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it acquires a kinetic energy, \(mgh\). If the work done or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors such as the velocity or the particular path taken by the object, the force would be called non-conservative.

The dimensions of potential energy are \([\mathrm{ML}^{2}\mathrm{T}^{-2}]\) and the unit is joule (J), the same as kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change in potential energy, for a conservative force, \(\Delta V\) is equal to the negative of the work done by the force

\[\Delta V=-F[x]\ \Delta x \tag{6.9}\]

In the example of the falling ball considered in this section we saw how potential energy was converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an important principle of conservation in mechanics, which we now proceed to examine.

### The conservation of mechanical energy

For simplicity we demonstrate this important principle for one-dimensional motion. Suppose that a body undergoes displacement \(\Delta x\) under the action of a conservative force \(F\). Then from the WE theorem we have.

\(\Delta K=F(x)\ \Delta x\)

If the force is conservative, the potential energy function \(V(x)\) can be defined such that

\(-\Delta V=F(x)\ \Delta x\)

The above equations imply that

\(\Delta K+\Delta V=0\)

\(\Delta(K+V)=0\)

which means that \(K+V\). the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the body is a constant. Over the whole path, \(x_{i}\) to \(x_{j}\), this means that

\(K_{i}+V(x_{i})=K_{f_{i}}+V(x_{j_{f}})\) (6.11)

The quantity \(K+V(x)\). is called the total mechanical energy of the system. Individually the kinetic energy \(K\) and the potential energy \(V(x)\) may vary from point to point. but the sum is a constant. The aptness of the term 'conservative force' is now clear.

Let us consider some of the definitions of a conservative force.

* A force \(F(x)\) is conservative if it can be derived from a scalar quantity \(V(x)\) by the relation given by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional generalisation requires the use of a vector derivative. which is outside the scope of this book.
* The work done by the conservative force depends only on the end points. This can be seen from the relation. \(W=K_{f}-K_{i}=V\ (x_{i})-V(x_{j})\) which depends on the end points.
* A third definition states that the work done by this force in a closed path is zero. This is once again apparent from Eq. (6.11) since \(x_{i}=x_{f}\).

Thus, the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy can be stated as

**The total mechanical energy of a system is conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are conservative**.

The above discussion can be made more concrete by considering the example of the gravitational force once again and that of the spring force in the next section. Fig. 6.5 depicts a ball of mass \(m\) being dropped from a cliff of height \(H\).

Figure 6.5: The conversion of potentialenergy to kinetic energy for a ball of mass \(m\) dropped from a height \(H\).

The total mechanical energies \(E_{{}_{0}}\), \(E_{{}_{h}}\), and \(E_{{}_{H}}\) of the ball at the indicated heights zero (ground level), \(h\) and \(H\), are

\[E_{{}_{H}} =mgH\] (6.11 a) \[E_{{}_{h}} =mgh+\frac{1}{2}mv_{h}^{2}\] (6.11 b) \[E_{{}_{0}} =(1/2)mv^{2}\] (6.11 c)

The constant force is a special case of a spatially dependent force \(F[x]\). Hence, the mechanical energy is conserved. Thus

\[E_{{}_{H}}=E_{{}_{0}}\] or, \[mgH=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}\] \[v_{{}_{f}}=\sqrt{2gH}\]

a result that was obtained in section 3.7 for a freely falling body.

Further,

\[E_{{}_{H}}=E_{{}_{h}}\]

which implies,

\[v_{{}_{h}}^{2}=2g[H-h]\] (6.11 d)

and is a familiar result from kinematics.

At the height \(H\), the energy is purely potential. It is partially converted to kinetic at height \(h\) and is fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy.

**Example 6.7**: _Abb of mass \(m\) is suspended by alight string of length \(L\). It is imparted a horizontal velocity \(v_{{}_{0}}\) at the lowest point A such that it completes a semi-circular trajectory in the vertical plane with the string becoming slack only on reaching the topmost point, C. This is shown in Fig. 6.6. Obtain an expression for \((i)v_{{}_{0}}^{2}(ii)\) the speeds at points Band C; \((iii)\) the ratio of the kinetic energies \((K_{{}_{B}}/K_{c})\) at B and C. Comment on the nature of the trajectory of the bob after it reaches the point C._

**Answer (i) There are two external forces on the bob : gravity and the tension \((T)\) in the string. The latter does no work since the displacement of the bob is always normal to the string. The potential energy of the bob is thus associated with the gravitational force only. The total mechanical energy \(E\) of the system is conserved. We take the potential energy of the system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus, at \(A\) :**

\[E=\frac{1}{2}mv_{{}_{0}}^{2} \tag{6.12}\] \[T_{{}_{A}}-mg=\frac{mv_{0}^{2}}{L} \tag{6.13}\]

where \(T_{{}_{A}}\) is the tension in the string at A. At the highest point C, the string slackens, as the tension in the string \((T_{{}_{C}})\) becomes zero.

Thus, at C

\[E=\frac{1}{2}mv_{{}_{c}}^{2}+2mgL \tag{6.14}\] \[\cdot\] \[mg=\frac{mv_{c}^{2}}{L} \tag{6.15}\]

where \(v_{{}_{C}}\) is the speed at C. From Eqs. (6.14) and (6.15) \[E=\frac{5}{2}mgL\]

Equating this to the energy at A

\[\frac{5}{2}mgL=\frac{m}{2}v_{{}_{0}}^{2}\]

or, \(v_{{}_{0}}=\sqrt{5gL}\)

(ii) It is clear from Eq. (6.15)

\[v_{{}_{C}}=\sqrt{gL}\]

At B, the energy is

\[E=\frac{1}{2}mv_{{}_{B}}^{2}+mgL\]

Equating this to the energy at A and employing the result from (i), namely \(v_{{}_{0}}^{2}=5gL\),

\[\frac{\cdot}{2}mv_{{}_{B}}^{2}+mgL=\frac{1}{2}mv_{{}_{0}}^{2}\]

\[\cdot\] \[=\frac{5}{2}m\ g\ L\]

Figure 6.6:

\[\therefore v_{B}-\sqrt{3gL}\]

(iii) The ratio of the kinetic energies at B and C is :

\[\cdot\] \[\frac{K_{B}}{K_{C}}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\textit{mv}_{B}^{2}}{\frac{1}{2} \textit{mv}_{C}^{2}}=\frac{3}{1}\]

At point C, the string becomes slack and the velocity of the bob is horizontal and to the left. If the connecting string is cut at this instant, the bob will execute a projectile motion with horizontal projection akin to a rock kicked horizontally from the edge of a cliff. Otherwise the bob will continue on its circular path and complete the revolution.

### The Potential Energy of a Spring

The spring force is an example of a variable force which is conservative, Fig. 6.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface. The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light and may be treated as massless. In an ideal spring, the spring force \(F_{s}\) is proportional to \(x\) where \(x\) is the displacement of the block from the equilibrium position. The displacement could be either positive {Fig. 6.7(b)} or negative {Fig. 6.7(c)}. This force law for the spring is called Hooke's law and is mathematically stated as

\[F_{s}=-kx\]

The constant \(k\) is called the spring constant. Its unit is N m-1. The spring is said to be stiff if \(k\) is large and soft if \(k\) is small.

Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in Fig. 6.7(b). If the extension is \(x_{m}\), the work done by the spring force is

\[\cdot\] \[W_{s}=\int_{0}^{x_{\text{pp}}}F_{s}\;dx=-\int_{0}^{x_{\text{pp}}}kx\;dx\] \[\cdot\] \[-\frac{k\;x_{m}^{2}}{2} \tag{6.15}\]

This expression may also be obtained by considering the area of the triangle as in Fig. 6.7(d). Note that the work done by the external pulling force \(F\) is positive since it overcomes the spring force.

The same is true when the spring is compressed with a displacement \(x_{c}\) (\(<0\)). The spring force does work \(W_{s}--kx_{c}^{2}/2\) while the 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:124]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:125]

unlike the conservative force, \(W_{nc}\) depends on the particular path \(i\) to \(f\). \(\dashv\)

### Various forms of energy: the law of conservation of energy

In the previous section we have discussed mechanical energy. We have seen that it can be classified into two distinct categories : one based on motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on configuration (position), namely potential energy. Energy comes in many a forms which transform into one another in ways which may not often be clear to us.

#### 6.10.1 Heat

We have seen that the frictional force is excluded from the category of conservative forces. However, work is associated with the force of friction. A block of mass \(m\) sliding on a rough horizontal surface with speed \(v_{o}\) comes to a halt over a distance \(x_{o}\). The work done by the force of kinetic friction \(f\) over \(x_{o}\)is -\(f\,x_{o}\). By the work- energy theorem \(m\,v_{o}^{2}/2\,=\,f\,x_{o}\). If we confine our scope to mechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy of the block is 'lost' due to the frictional force. On examination of the block and the table we would detect a slight increase in their temperatures. The work done by friction is not 'lost', but is transferred as heat energy. This raises the internal energy of the block and the table. In winter, in order to feel warm, we generate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms together. We shall see later that the internal energy is associated with the ceaseless, often random, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea of the transfer of heat energy is obtained by noting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J of energy when it cools by10 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

#### 6.10.2 Chemical Energy

One of the greatest technical achievements of humankind occurred when we discovered how to ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two flint stones together (mechanical energy), got them to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves (chemical energy), which then provided sustained warmth. A match stick ignites into a bright flame when struck against a specially prepared chemical surface. The lighted matchstick, when applied to a firecracker, results in a spectacular display of sound and light.

Chemical energy arises from the fact that the molecules participating in the chemical reaction have different binding energies. Astable chemical compound has less energy than the separated parts. A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms. If the total energy of the reactants is more than the products of the reaction, heat is released and the reaction is said to be an **exothermic** reaction. If the reverse is true, heat is absorbed and the reaction is **endothermic**. Coal consists of carbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases \(3\times\,10^{7}\,\)J of energy.

Chemical energy is a associated with the forces that give rise to the stability of substances. These forces bind atoms in to molecules, molecules into polymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy arising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas, wood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily existence.

#### 6.10.3 Electrical Energy

The flow of electrical current causes bulbs to grow, fans to rotate and bells to ring. There are laws governing the attraction and repulsion of charges and currents, which we shall learn later. Energy is associated with an electric current. An urban Indian household consumes about 200 J of energy per second on an average.

#### 6.10.4 The Equivalence of Mass and Energy

Till the end of the nineteenth century, physicists believed that in every physical and chemical process, the mass of an isolated system is conserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g. glacial ice could melt in to a gushing stream, but matter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert Einstein (1879-1955) however, showed that mass and energy are equivalent and are related by the relation

\[E=m\,c^{2} \tag{6.20}\]

where \(c\), the speed of light in vacuum is approximately \(3\times 10^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\). Thus, a staggering amount of energy is associated with a mere kilogram of matter

\[E=1\times\{3\times 10^{8}\}^{2}\,\mathrm{J}=9\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{J}.\]

This is equivalent to the annual electrical output of a large (3000 MW) power generating station.

#### 6.10.5 Nuclear Energy

The most destructive weapons made by man, the fission and fusion bombs are manifestations of the above equivalence of mass and energy [Eq. [6.20]]. On the other hand the explanation of the life-nourishing energy output of the sun is also based on the above equation. In this case effectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus whose mass is less than the sum of the masses of the reactants. This mass difference, called the mass defect \(\Delta m\) is the source of energy \((\Delta m)c^{2}\). In fission, a heavy nucleus like uranium \(\frac{235}{92}\) U, is split by a neutron into lighter nuclei. Once again the final mass is less than the initial mass and the mass difference translates into energy, which can be tapped to provide electrical energy as in nuclear power plants (controlled nuclear fission) or can be employed in making nuclear weapons (uncontrolled nuclear fission). Strictly, the energy \(\Delta E\) released in a chemical reaction can also be related to the mass defect \(\Delta m=\Delta E/c^{2}\). However, for a chemical reaction, this mass defect is much smaller than for a nuclear reaction. Table 6.3 lists the total energies for a variety of events and phenomena.

_Example 6.10_: Examine Tables 6.1-6.3 and express (a) The energy required to break one bond in DNA in eV; (b) The kinetic energy of an air molecule (\(10^{-21}\)J) in eV; (c) The daily intake of a human adult in kilocalories.

_Answer_: (a) Energy required to break one bond of DNA is

\[\frac{10^{-20}\,\mathrm{J}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{J/eV}}\simeq 0.06\, \mathrm{eV}\]

where the symbol '\(z\)' stands for approximate. Note 0.1 eV = 100 meV (100 millilelectron volt).

(b) The kinetic energy of an air molecule is

\[\frac{10^{-21}\,\mathrm{J}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{J/eV}}\simeq 0.0062\, \mathrm{eV}\]

This is the same as 6.2 meV.

(c) The average human consumption in a day is

\[\frac{10^{7}\,\mathrm{J}}{4.2\times 10^{3}\,\mathrm{J/kcal}}\simeq 2400\, \mathrm{kcal}\]

#### The Principle of Conservation of Energy

We have seen that the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved if the forces doing work on it are conservative. If some of the forces involved are non-conservative. part of the mechanical energy may get transformed into other forms such as heat. light and sound. However, the total energy of an isolated system does not change, as long as one accounts for all forms of energy. Energy maybe transformed from one form to another but the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. Energy can neither be created. nor destroyed.

Since the universe as a whole may be viewed as an isolated system, the total energy of the universe is constant. If one part of the universe loses energy. another part must gain an equal amount of energy.

The principle of conservation of energy cannot be proved. However, no violation of this principle has been observed. The concept of conservation and transformation of energy in to various forms links together various branches of physics. chemistry and life sciences. It provides a unifying, enduring element in our scientific pursuits. From engineering point of view all electronic, communication and mechanical devices rely on some forms of energy transformation.

### Power

Often it is interesting to know not only the work done on an object, but also the rate at which this work is done. We say a person is physically fit if he not only climbs four floors of a building but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the time rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

The average power of a force is defined as the ratio of the work. \(W\), to the total time \(t\) taken

\[P_{av}=\frac{W}{t}\]

The instantaneous power is defined as the limiting value of the average power as time interval approaches zero.

\[P=\frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{6.21}\]

The work \(dW\) done by a force \(F\) for a displacement \(d\mathbf{r}\) is \(dW=\mathbf{F}.d\mathbf{r}\). The instantaneous power can also be expressed as

\[P=\mathbf{F}.\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t}\]

\[=\mathbf{F}.\mathbf{v} \tag{6.22}\]

where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the instantaneous velocity when the force is \(\mathbf{F}\).

Power, like work and energy, is a scalar quantity. Its dimensions are [ML2T-3]. In the SI, its unit is called a watt (W). The watt is 1 J s\({}^{1}\). The unit of power is named after James Watt. one of the innovators of the steam engine in the eighteenth century.

There is another unit of power, namely the horse-power (hp)

1 hp = 746 W

This unit is still used to describe the output of automobiles, motorbikes, etc.

We encounter the unit watt when we buy electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and refrigerators. A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10 hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.

100 (watt) \(\times\) 10 (hour)

= 1000 watt hour

=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)

= 10\({}^{3}\) (W) \(\times\) 3600 (s)

An experiment on head-on collision

In performing an experiment on collision on a horizontal surface, we face three difficulties. One, there will be friction and bodies will not travel with uniform velocities. Two, if two bodies of different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision unless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly difficult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision.

By performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take two balls, one of which is heavier (basketball/football/volleyball) and the other lighter(tennis ball/rubber ball/table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from some height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the floor or ground, just before and just after the bounce (by using \(v^{2}=2gh\) ). Hence you will get the coefficient of restitution.

Now take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your hands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter one, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain together while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the heavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the lighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to hold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and does not fly sideways. This is head-on collision.

You can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you the best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance. We leave it to you to think how you can determine the initial and final velocities of the balls.

\[\cdot\]

\[=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1t}^{2}\]

which is a positive quantity as expected.

Consider next an elastic collision. Using the above nomenclature with \(\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}=0\), the momentum and kinetic energy conservation equations are

\[m_{1}v_{1t}=m_{1}v_{1t}+m_{2}v_{2f} \tag{6.24}\] \[\cdot\] \[m_{1}v_{1t}^{2}=m_{1}v_{1f}^{2}+m_{2}v_{2f}^{2} \tag{6.25}\]

From Eqs. (6.24) and (6.25) it follows that,

\[m_{1}v_{u}(v_{2f}-v_{1t})=m_{1}v_{1f}(v_{2f}-v_{1f})\] \[\cdot v_{2f}(v_{1t}-v_{1f})=v_{1t}^{2}-v_{1f}^{2}\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[v_{1f}=\frac{(m_{1}-m_{2})}{m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1t} \tag{6.27}\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[v_{2f}=\frac{2m_{1}v_{1t}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \tag{6.28}\]

Thus, the 'unknown' \(\{v_{1,f}\), \(v_{2,f}\}\) are obtained in terms of the 'knowns' \(\{m_{1},\,m_{2},\,v_{1,f}\}\). Special cases of our analysis are interesting.

**Case I :** If the two masses are equal

\[v_{1f}=0\] \[v_{2f}=v_{1t}\]

The first mass comes to rest and pushes off the second mass with its initial speed on collision.

**Case II :** If one mass dominates, e.g. \(m_{2}>\,>\,m_{1}\)

\(v_{1f}\simeq-v_{1t}\)\(v_{2f}\simeq 0\)

The heavier mass is undisturbed while the lighter mass reverses its velocity.

**Example 6.12**: Slowing down ofneutrons: In a nuclear reactor a neutron of high speed (typically \(10^{7}\,\)m s\({}^{3}\)) must be slowedto \(10^{3}\) m s\({}^{-1}\) so that it can have a high probability of interacting with isotope \({}^{235}_{~{}~{}~{}~{}92}\)U and causing it to fission. Show that a neutron can lose most of its kinetic energy in an elastic collision with a light nuclei like deuterium or carbon which has a mass of only a few times the neutron mass. The material making up the light nuclei, usually heavy water (D\({}_{2}\)O) or graphite, is called a moderator.

_Answer_: The initial kinetic energy of the neutron is

\[K_{1t}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1t}^{2}\]

while its final kinetic energy from Eq. (6.27)

\[K_{1f}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1f}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}\left(\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{ 1}+m_{2}}\right)^{2}v_{1t}^{2}\]

The fractional kinetic energy lost is

\[J_{1}=\frac{K_{1f}}{K_{1t}}=\left(\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right)^{2}\]

while the fractional kinetic energy gained by the moderating nuclei \(K_{2f}/K_{1t}\) is

\[\begin{array}{l}f_{2}=1~{}-f_{1}\left(\text{elastic collision}\right)\\ \hskip 14.226378pt=\frac{4m_{1}m_{2}}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)^{2}}\end{array}\]

One can also verify this result by substituting from Eq. (6.28).

For deuterium \(m_{2}=2m_{1}\) and we obtain \(f_{1}=1/9\) while \(f_{2}=8/9\). Almost 90% of the neutron's energy is transferred to deuterium. For carbon \(f_{1}=71.6\%\) and \(f_{2}=28.4\%\). In practice, however, this number is smaller since head-on collisions are rare.

If the initial velocities and final velocities of both the bodies are along the same straight line, then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or **head-on collision.** In the case of small spherical bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2 which is at rest. In general, the collision is two-dimensional, where the initial velocities and the final velocities lie in a plane.

#### Collisions in Two Dimensions

Fig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving mass \(m_{i}\) with the stationary mass \(m_{2}\). Linear momentum is conserved in such a collision. Since momentum is a vector this implies three equations for the three directions \(\{x,y,z\}\). Consider the plane determined by the final velocity directions of \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) and choose it to be the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The conservation of the z-component of the linear momentum implies that the entire collision is in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The \(x\)- and \(y\)-component equations are

\[m_{1}v_{1t}=m_{1}v_{1t}\cos\theta_{1}+m_{2}v_{2t}\cos\theta_{2} \tag{6.29}\] \[0~{}=m_{1}v_{1f}~{}\sin\theta_{1}-m_{2}v_{2t}\sin\theta_{2} \tag{6.30}\]

One knows \(\{m_{1},m_{2},v_{1t}\}\) in most situations. There are thus four unknowns \(\{v_{1t},v_{2t},\theta_{1}and\theta_{2}\}\), and only two equations. If \(\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}=0\), we regain Eq. (6.24) for one dimensional collision.

If, further the collision is elastic,

\[\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1t}{}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1f}{}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2 f}{}^{2} \tag{6.31}\]

We obtain an additional equation. That still leaves us one equation short. At least one of the four unknowns, say \(\theta_{1}\), must be made known for the problem to be solvable. For example, \(\theta_{1}\) can be determined by moving a detector in an angular fashion from the \(x\) to the \(y\) axis. Given \(\{m_{1},m_{2},v_{1t},\theta_{1}\}\) we can determine \(\{v_{1t},v_{2t},\theta_{2}\}\) from Eqs. (6.29)-(6.31).

Example 6.13: Consider the collision depicted in Fig. 6.10 to be between two billiard balls with equal masses \(m_{1}=m_{2}\). The first ball is called the cue while the second ball is called the target. The billiard player wants to'sink' the target ball in a corner pocket, which is at an angle \(\theta_{2}=37\)'. Assume that the collision is elastic and that friction and rotational motion are not important. Obtain \(\theta_{1}\).

_Answer_: From momentum conservation, since the masses are equal

\[\begin{array}{l}\dot{\textbf{v}}_{1t}=\textbf{v}_{1t}+\textbf{v}_{2t}\\ \hskip 14.226378pt\textbf{or}\hskip 14.226378pt\textbf{v}_{1t}{}^{2}=\left( \textbf{v}_{1t}+\textbf{v}_{2t}\right)\cdot\left(\textbf{v}_{1t}+\textbf{v}_{2t }\right)\\ \hskip 14.226378pt=v_{1f}{}^{2}+v_{2f}{}^{2}+2\textbf{v}_{1f}{}_{2f}\end{array}\]\[= {v_{1f}}^{2}+{v_{2f}}^{2}+2{v_{1f}}{v_{2f}}\cos\ \left({\theta_{1}+37^{\circ}} \right)\ \Big{\}} \tag{6.32}\]

Since the collision is elastic and \(m_{1}=m_{2}\) it follows from conservation of kinetic energy that

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v_{1u}}}^{2}={v_{1f}}^{2}+{v_{2f}}^{2} \tag{6.33}\]

Comparing Eqs. (6.32) and (6.33), we get

\[\cos\left({\theta_{1}+37^{\circ}}\right)=0\]

or \(\theta_{1}+37^{\circ}=90^{\circ}\)

Thus, \(\theta_{1}=53^{\circ}\)

This proves the following result : when two equal masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with one of them at rest, after the collision, they will move at right angles to each other.

## Summary

1. The _work-energy theorem_ states that the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work done by the net force on the body. \[K,-K_{i}=W_{m}.\]
2. A force is _conservative_ if (i) work done by it on an object is path independent and depends only on the end points \(\left\{x,x\right\}\), or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.
3. For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a _potential energy_function \(V(x)\) such that \[F\left(x\right)=-\frac{\mathrm{d}V\left(x\right)}{\mathrm{d}x}\] or \[V_{i}-V_{f}=\int\limits_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}F\left(x\right)\mathrm{d}x\]
4. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical energy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.
5. The _gravitational potential energy_ of a particle of mass \(m\) at a height \(x\) about the earth's surface is \[V(x)=m\ g\ x\] where the variation of \(g\) with height is ignored.
6. The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant \(k\) and extension \(x\) is \[V\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{2}k\ x^{2}\]
7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) is written as \(\mathbf{A.B}\) and is a scalar quantity given by : \(\mathbf{A.B}=A\mathbf{B}\cos\ \theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\). It can be positive, negative or zero depending upon the value of \(\theta\). The scalar product of two vectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component of the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors : \[\mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{i}=\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{j}=\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} =1\ \text{and}\ \ \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{j}=\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{j}=\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{i}=0\] Scalar products obey the commutative and the distributive laws.

The potential energy function for a particle executing linear simple harmonic motion is given by V(x) = k\(\alpha\)/2, where \(k\) is the force constant of the oscillator. For \(k\) = 0.5 N m\({}^{\spherical}\), the graph of V(x) versus \(x\) is shown in Fig. 12.

## Chapter 7 Systems of Particles and Rotational Motion

### 7.1 Introduction

In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion of a single particle (A particle is represented as a point mass. It has practically no size). We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle.

Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in unders landing the motion of extended bodies.

A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. **Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between different pairs of such a body do not change**. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible. Thus, in a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp, bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid.

#### 7.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?

Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewisemovement. The block is a rigid body. Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time. The rigid body here is in pure translational motion (Fig. 7.1).

**In pure translational motion at any instant of time every particle of the body has the same velocity.**

Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, has translational motion. But as Fig. 7.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body therefore, is not in pure translation. Its motion is translation plus'something else.'

**Fig 7.2**: _Rolling motion of a cylinder It is not pure translational motion. Points \(P_{i}\), \(P_{x}\), \(P_{x}\) and \(P_{x}\) have different velocities (shown by arrows) at any instant of time, In fact, the velocity of the point of contact \(P_{x}\) is zero at any instant, if the \(\alpha\)_inder rolls without slipping._

In order to understand what this'something else' is, let us take a rigid body so constrained that it cannot have translational motion. The most common way to constrain a rigid body so that it does not have translational motion is to fix it along a straight line. The only possible motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line along which the body is fixed is termed as its **axis of rotation**. If you look around, you will come across many examples of rotation about an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter's wheel, a \(\beta\)ant wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig 7.3(a) and (b)).

**Fig 7.3**: _Rotation about a fixed axis (a) A ceiling fan (b) A potter’s wheel._

Let us try to understand what rotation is, what characterises rotation. You may notice that **in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:143]

rotation of such a fan has an oscillating (sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about the vertical through the point at which the axis is pivoted (point O in Fig. 7.5(b)).

While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more general cases of rotation, such as the rotation of a top or a pedestal fan, **one point and not one line**, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case the axis is not fixed, though it always passes through the fixed point. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed. Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis only unless stated otherwise.

The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation. Thus, the'something else' in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion. You will find Fig. 7.6(a) and (b) instructive from this point of view. Both these figures show motion of the same body along identical translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7.6(a), the motion is a pure translation; in the other case [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of translation and rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown using a rigid object like a heavy book.)

We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section: **The motion of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in some way is either a pure translation or a combination of translation and rotation. The motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed in some way is rotation.** The rotation may be about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or moving (e.g. an oscillating table fan). We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.

### Centre of Mass

We shall first see what the centre of mass of a system of particles is and then discuss its significance. For simplicity we shall start with a two particle system. We shall take the line joining the two particles to be the \(x\)- axis.

Let the distances of the two particles be \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) respectively from some origin O. Let \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) be respectiv

With the \(X\) and \(Y\) axes chosen as shown in Fig. 7.9, the coordinates of points O, A and B forming the equilateral triangle are respectively (0,0), (0.5,0), (0.25,0.25\(\sqrt{3}\)). Let the masses 100 g, 150 g and 200g be located at O, A and B be respectively. Then,

\[X=\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+m_{3}x_{3}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}}\]

\[\cdot\]

\[=\frac{\left[100(0)+150(0.5)+200(0.25)\right]\ g\ m}{\left[100+150+200\right]\ g}\]

\[\cdot\]

\[=\frac{75+50}{450}\ m=\frac{125}{450}\ m=\frac{5}{18}\ m\]

\[Y=\frac{\left[100(0)+150(0)+200(0.25\sqrt{3})\right]\ g\ m}{450\ g}\]

\[\cdot\]

\[=\frac{50\sqrt{3}}{450}\ m=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{9}\ m=\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\ m\]

The centre of mass C is shown in the figure. Note that it is not the geometric centre of the triangle OAB. Why? 

_Example 7.2_: Find the centre of mass of a triangular lamina.

_Answer_: The lamina (\(\Delta\)_LMN_) may be subdivided into narrow strips each parallel to the base _(MN)_ as shown in Fig. 7.10

By symmetry each strip has its centre of mass at its midpoint. If we join the midpoint of all the strips we get the median LP. The centre of mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has to lie on the median LP. Similarly, we can argue that it lies on the median MQ and NR. This means the centre of mass lies on the point of concurrence of the medians, i.e. on the centroid G of the triangle. 

_Example 7.3_: Find the centre of mass of a uniform L-shaped lamina (a thin flat plate) with dimensions as shown. The mass of the lamina is 3 kg.

_Answer_: Choosing the \(X\) and \(Y\) axes as shown in Fig. 7.11 we have the coordinates of the vertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the figure. We can think of the L-shape to consist of 3 squares each of length 1m. The mass of each square is 1kg, since the lamina is uniform. The centres of mass C\({}_{{}_{1}}\), C\({}_{{}_{2}}\) and C\({}_{{}_{3}}\) of the squares are, by symmetry, their geometric centres and have coordinates (1/2,1/2), (3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) respectively. We take the masses of the squares to be concentrated at these points. The centre of mass of the whole L shape (\(X\), \(Y\)) is the centre of mass of these mass points.

_Fig. 7.11_

Hence

\[X=\frac{\left[1(1/2)+1(3/2)+1(1/2)\right]\ kg\ m}{\left(1+1+1\right)kg}\ \cdot=\frac{5}{6}\ m\]

\[Y=\frac{\left[\left[1(1/2)+1(1/2)+1(3/2)\right]\ \right]\ kg\ m}{\left(1+1+1\right)kg}= \frac{5}{6}\ m\]

The centre of mass of the L-shape lies on the line OD. We could have guessed this without calculations. Can you tell why? Suppose, the three squares that make up the L shaped lamina of Fig. 7.11 had different masses. How will you then determine the centre of mass of the lamina? \(\triangle\)

### Motion of Centre of Mass

Equipped with the definition of the centre of mass, we are now in a position to discuss its physical importance for a system of particles. We may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as

\[\dot{M}\mathbf{R}=\sum m_{1}\mathbf{r}_{1}=m_{1}\mathbf{r}_{1}+m_{2}\mathbf{r }_{2}+...+m_{n}\mathbf{r}_{n} \tag{7.7}\]

Differentiating the two sides of the equation with respect to time we get

\[\dot{M}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}t}=m_{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r }_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}+m_{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}+...+m_{n }\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{n}}{\mathrm{d}t}\]

or

\[\dot{M}\mathbf{V}=m_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+m_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}+...+m_{n}\mathbf{v} _{n} \tag{7.8}\]

where \(\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{1}(=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{1}/\mathrm{d}t)\) is the velocity of the first particle \(\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{2}(=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{2}/\mathrm{d}t)\) is the velocity of the second particle etc. and \(\mathbf{V}=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}/\mathrm{d}t\) is the velocity of the centre of mass. Note that we assumed the masses \(m_{1}\), \(m_{2}\),... etc. do not change in time. We have therefore, treated them as constants in differentiating the equations with respect to time.

Differentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time, we obtain

\[\dot{M}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{V}}{\mathrm{d}t}=m_{1}\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}+m_{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t }+...+m_{n}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_{n}}{\mathrm{d}t}\]

or

\[\dot{M}\mathbf{A}=m_{1}\mathbf{a}_{1}+m_{2}\mathbf{a}_{2}+...+m_{n}\mathbf{a }_{n} \tag{7.9}\]

where \(\dot{\mathbf{a}}_{1}(=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_{1}/\mathrm{d}t)\) is the acceleration of the first particle, \(\dot{\mathbf{a}}_{2}(=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}_{2}/\mathrm{d}t)\) is the acceleration of the second particle etc. and \(\dot{\mathbf{A}}(=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{V}/\mathrm{d}t)\) is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system of particles.

Now, from Newton's second law, the force acting on the first particle is given by \(\dot{\mathbf{F}}_{1}=m_{1}\mathbf{a}_{1}\). The force acting on the second particle is given by \(\dot{\mathbf{F}}_{2}=m_{2}\mathbf{a}_{2}\) and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written as

\[\dot{M}\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{F}_{1}+\mathbf{F}_{2}+...+\mathbf{F}_{n} \tag{7.10}\]

Thus, the total mass of a system of particles times the acceleration of its centre of mass is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the system of particles.

Note when we talk of the force \(\dot{\mathbf{F}}_{1}\) on the first particle, it is not a single force, but the vector sum of all the forces on the first particle: likewise for the second particle etc. Among these forces on each particle there will be **external** forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also **internal** forces exerted by the particles on one another. We know from Newton's third law that these internal forces occur in equal and opposite pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10), their contribution is zero. Only the external forces contribute to the equation. We can then rewrite Eq. (7.10) as

\[\dot{M}\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ex}} \tag{7.11}\]

where \(\dot{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{ex}}\) represents the sum of all external forces acting on the particles of the system.

Eq. (7.11) states that **the centre of mass of a system of particles moves as if all the mass of the system was concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces were applied at that point.**

Notice, to determine the motion of the centre of mass no knowledge of internal forces of the system of particles is required: for this purpose we need to know only the external forces.

To obtain Eq. (7.11) we did not need to specify the nature of the system of particles. The system may be a collection of particles in which there may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may be a rigid body which has either puretranslational motion or a combination of translational and rotational motion. Whatever is the system and the motion of its individual particles, the centre of mass moves according to Eq. (7.11).

Instead of treating extended bodies as single particles as we have done in earlier chapters, we can now treat them as systems of particles. We can obtain the translational component of their motion, i.e. the motion centre of mass of the system, by taking the mass of the whole system to be concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces on the system to be acting at the centre of mass.

This is the procedure that we followed earlier in analysing forces on bodies and solvingproblems without explicitly outlining and justifying the procedure. We now realise that in earlier studies we assumed, without saying so, that rotational motion and/or internal motion of the particles were either absent or negligible. We no longer need to do this. We have not only found the justification of the procedure we followed earlier; but we also have found how to describe and separate the translational motion of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds of internal motion.

Figure 7.12 is a good illustration of Eq. (7.11). A projectile, following the usual parabolic trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in air. The forces leading to the explosion are internal forces. They contribute nothing to the motion of the centre of mass. The total external force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the body, is the same before and after the explosion. The centre of mass under the influence of the external force continues, therefore, along the same parabolic trajectory as it would have followed if there were no explosion.

### LINEAR MOMENTUM OF SYSTEM OF PARTICLES

Let us recall that the linear momentum of a particle is defined as

\[\textbf{p}=m\,\textbf{v} \tag{7.12}\]

Let us also recall that Newton's second law written in symbolic form for a single particle is \(\cdot\)

\[\textbf{F}=\frac{\textbf{dp}}{\textbf{d}t} \tag{7.13}\]

where **F** is the force on the particle. Let us consider a system of \(n\) particles with masses \(m_{{}_{1}}\), \(m_{{}_{2}}\),...\(m_{{}_{n}}\) respectively and velocities \(\textbf{v}_{{}_{1}}\),\(\textbf{v}_{{}_{2}}\),.......\(\textbf{v}_{{}_{n}}\) respectively. The particles may be interacting and have external forces acting on them. The linear momentum of the first particle is \(m_{{}_{1}}\textbf{v}_{{}_{1}}\), of the second particle is \(m_{{}_{2}}\textbf{v}_{{}_{2}}\) and so on.

For the system of \(n\) particles, the linear momentum of the system is defined to be the vector sum of all individual particles of the system,

\[\begin{array}{l}\textbf{P}=\textbf{p}_{{}_{1}}+\textbf{p}_{{}_{2}}+...+ \textbf{p}_{{}_{n}}\\ \cdot\\ =m_{{}_{1}}\textbf{v}_{{}_{1}}+m_{{}_{2}}\textbf{v}_{{}_{2}}+...+m_{{}_{n}} \textbf{v}_{{}_{n}}\end{array} \tag{7.14}\]

Comparing this with Eq. (7.8)

\[\textbf{P}=M\,\textbf{V} \tag{7.15}\]

Thus, **the total momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total mass of the system and the velocity of its centre of mass**. Differentiating Eq. (7.15) with respect to time,

\[\frac{\textbf{d}\textbf{p}}{\textbf{d}t}=M\,\frac{\textbf{dV}}{\textbf{d}t}=M \textbf{A} \tag{7.16}\]

Comparing Eq.(7.16) and Eq. (7.11),

\[\frac{\textbf{d}\textbf{p}}{\textbf{d}t}=\textbf{F}_{\text{ex}} \tag{7.17}\]

This is the statement of **Newton's second law extended to a system of particles.**

Suppose now, that the sum of external forces acting on a system of particles is zero. Then from Eq.(7.17)

\[\frac{\textbf{d}\textbf{p}}{\textbf{d}t}=0\quad\textbf{or}\quad\textbf{P}= \text{Constant} \tag{7.18a}\]

Thus, when the total external force acting on a system of particles is zero, the total linear momentum of the system is constant. This is the law of conservation of the total linear momentum of a system of particles. Because of Eq. (7.15), this also means that when the total external force on the system is zero the velocity of the centre of mass remains constant. [We assume throughout the discussion on systems of particles in this chapter that the total mass of the system remains constant)

Note that on account of the internal forces, i.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one another, the individual particles may have complicated trajectories. Yet, if the total external force acting on the system is zero, the centre of mass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves uniformly in a straight line like a free particle.

The vector Eq. (7.18a) is equivalent to three scalar equations,

\(P_{x}=c_{1}\), \(P_{y}=c_{2}\) and \(P_{x}=c_{3}\) (7.18 b)

Here \(P_{x}\), \(P_{y}\) and \(P_{x}\) are the components of the total linear momentum vector **P** along the x, \(y\) and **z** axes respectively; \(c_{1}\), \(c_{2}\) and \(c_{3}\) are constants.

As an example, let us consider the radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle, like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an alpha particle. The forces leading to the decay are internal to the system and the external forces on the system are negligible. So the total linear momentum of the system is the same before and after decay. The two particles produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and the alpha particle, move in different directions in such a way that their centre of mass moves along the same path along which the original decaying radium nucleus was moving [Fig. 7.13(a)].

If we observe the decay from the frame of reference in which the centre of mass is at rest, the motion of the particles involved in the decay looks particularly simple: the product particles move back to back with their centre of mass remaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b).

In many problems on the system of particles as in the above radioactive decay problem, it is convenient to work in the centre of mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame of reference.

In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a common occurrence. If there are no external forces, the centre of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7.14 (a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal mass are also shown in the figure; they look complicated. If we go to the centre of mass frame, then we find that there the two stars are moving in a circle, about the centre of mass, which is at rest. Note that the position of the stars have to be diametrically opposite to each other [Fig. 7.14(b)]. Thus in our frame of reference, the trajectories of the stars are a combination of (i) uniform motion in a straight line of the centre of mass and (ii) circular orbits of the stars about the centre of mass.

As can be seen from the two examples, separating the motion of different parts of a system into motion of the centre of mass and motion about the centre of mass is a very useful technique that helps in understanding the motion of the system.

### Vector Product of Two Vectors

We are already familiar with vectors and their use in physics. In chapter 6 [Work, Energy, Power] we defined the scalar product of two vectors. An important physical quantity, work, is defined as a scalar product of two vector quantities, force and displacement.

Figure 7.13: (a) A heavy nucleus (Ra) splits into a lighter nucleus (Rn) and an alpha particle (He). The CM of the system is in uniform motion. (b) The same splitting of the heavy nucleus (Ra) with the centre of mass at rest. The two product particles fly back to back

We shall now define another product of two vectors. This product is a vector. Two important quantities in the study of rotational motion, namely, moment of a force and angular momentum, are defined as vector products.

Definition of Vector Product

A vector product of two vectors **a** and **b** is a vector **c** such that

* magnitude of **c** = \(c\) = _ab_ sin_ _where a and b are magnitudes of **a** and **b** and _th_ is the angle between the two vectors._
* **c** is perpendicular to the plane containing **a** and **b**.
* if we take a right handed screw with its head lying in the plane of **a** and **b** and the screw perpendicular to this plane, and if we turn the head in the direction from **a** to **b**, then the tip of the screw advances in the direction of **c**. This right handed screw rule is illustrated in Fig. 7.15a.

Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of right hand around a line perpendicular to the plane of the vectors **a** and **b** and if the fingers are curled up in the direction from **a** to **b**, then the stretched thumb points in the direction of **c**, as shown in Fig, 7.15b.

A simpler version of the right hand rule is the following : Open up your right hand palm and curl the fingers pointing from **a** to **b**. Your stretched thumb points in the direction of **c**.

It should be remembered that there are two angles between any two vectors **a** and **b**. In Fig, 7.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to (as shown) and (360\({}^{\circ}\)- _th_). While applying either of the above rules, the rotation should be taken through the smaller angle (<180\({}^{\circ}\)) between **a** and **b**. It is _th_ here.

Because of the cross used to denote the vector product, it is also referred to as cross product.

* Note that scalar product of two vectors is commutative as said earlier, **a.b** = **b.a** The vector product, however, is not commutative, i.e. **a** \(\times\)**b** \(\times\)**a** The magnitude of both **a**\(\times\)**b** and **b**\(\times\)**a** is the same (_ab_ sin_ _th_); also, both of them are perpendicular to the plane of **a** and **b**. But the rotation of the right-handed screw in case of **a**\(\times\)**b** is from **a** to **b**, whereas in case of **b**\(\times\)**a** it is from **b** to **a**. This means the two vectors are in opposite directions. We have **a**\(\times\)**b** = -**b**\(\times\)**a** Another interesting property of a vector product is its behaviour under reflection. Under reflection (i.e. on taking the mirror image) we have \(x\rightarrow-x.y\rightarrow-y\) and **z**\(\rightarrow-\)**z**. As a result all the components of a vector change sign and thus \(`a\rightarrow-a.\)\(b\rightarrow-b.\) What happens to **a**\(\times\)**b** under reflection? **a**\(\times\)**b**\(\rightarrow\)(-**a**)\(\times\)(-**b**) = **a**\(\times\)**b** Thus, **a**\(\times\)**b** does not change sign under reflection.
* Both scalar and vector products are distributive with respect to vector addition. Thus, **a.**(**b**+**c**) = **a.b**+**a.c** **a**\(\times\)**(**b**+**c**) = **a**\(\times\)**b**+**a**\(\times\)**c** We may write **c** = **a**\(\times\)**b** in the component form. For this we first need to obtain some elementary cross products: (i) **a**\(\times\)**a** = **0** (**0** is a null vector, i.e. a vector with zero magnitude) This follows since magnitude of **a**\(\times\)**a** is \(a^{2}\sin 0^{\circ}\)= 0.

Figure 7.15: (a) Rule of the right handed screw for defining the direction of the vector product of two vectors, **b** Rule of the right hand for defining the vector product of two vectors, **a** and **b** Rule of the right hand for defining the direction of the vector product.

From this follow the results

\(\dot{\bf i}\times\dot{\bf i}={\bf 0},\ \dot{\bf j}\times\dot{\bf j}={\bf 0},\ \dot{\bf k} \times\dot{\bf k}={\bf 0}\)

(ii) \(\dot{\bf i}\times\dot{\bf j}=\dot{\bf k}\)

Note that the magnitude of \(\dot{\bf i}\times\dot{\bf j}\) is \(\sin 90^{\circ}\) or 1, since \(\dot{\bf i}\) and \(\dot{\bf j}\) both have unit magnitude and the angle between them is \(90^{\circ}\). Thus, \(\dot{\bf i}\times\dot{\bf j}\) is a unit vector. A unit vector perpendicular to the plane of \(\dot{\bf i}\) and \(\dot{\bf j}\) and related to them by the right hand screw rule is \(\dot{\bf k}\). Hence, the above result. You may verify similarly,

\(\dot{\bf j}\times\dot{\bf k}=\dot{\bf i}\) and \(\dot{\bf k}\times\dot{\bf i}=\dot{\bf j}\)

From the rule for commutation of the cross product, it follows:

\(\dot{\bf j}\times\dot{\bf i}=-\dot{\bf k}\), \(\dot{\bf k}\times\dot{\bf j}=-\dot{\bf i}\), \(\dot{\bf i}\times\dot{\bf k}=-\dot{\bf j}\)

Note if \(\dot{\bf i},\dot{\bf j},\dot{\bf k}\) occur cyclically in the above vector product relation, the vector product is positive. If \(\dot{\bf i},\dot{\bf j},\dot{\bf k}\) do not occur in cyclic order, the vector product is negative.

Now,

\({\bf a}\times{\bf b}=\{a_{x}\dot{\bf i}+a_{y}\dot{\bf j}+a_{z}\dot{\bf k}\} \times\{b_{x}\dot{\bf i}+b_{y}\dot{\bf j}+b_{z}\dot{\bf k}\}\)

\(\dot{\bf a}_{x}b_{y}\dot{\bf k}-a_{x}b_{y}\dot{\bf j}-a_{y}b_{x}\dot{\bf k}+a_ {y}b_{z}\dot{\bf l}+a_{z}b_{x}\dot{\bf j}-a_{z}b_{y}\dot{\bf l}\)

\(\dot{\bf a}_{y}b_{z}-a_{z}b_{x}\dot{\bf i}+\{a_{z}b_{x}-a_{z}b_{z}\}\dot{\bf j }+\{a_{x}b_{y}-a_{y}b_{x}\}\dot{\bf k}\)

We have used the elementary cross products in obtaining the above relation. The expression for \({\bf a}\times{\bf b}\) can be put in a determinant form which is easy to remember.

\({\bf a}\times{\bf b}=\begin{vmatrix}\dot{\bf i}&\dot{\bf j}&\dot{\bf k}\\ a_{x}&a_{y}&a_{x}\\ b_{x}&b_{y}&b_{z}\end{vmatrix}\)

_Example 7.4_: _Find the scalar and vector products of two vectors. \({\bf a}=(3\dot{\bf i}-4\dot{\bf j}+5\dot{\bf k})\) and \({\bf b}=(-2\dot{\bf i}+\dot{\bf j}-3\dot{\bf k})\)_

_Answer_

\(\dot{\bf a}\times{\bf b}=\begin{vmatrix}\dot{\bf i}-4\dot{\bf j}+5\dot{\bf k }\dot{\bf j}-2\dot{\bf i}+\dot{\bf j}-3\dot{\bf k}\end{vmatrix}\)

\(\dot{\bf a}\times{\bf b}=\begin{vmatrix}\dot{\bf i}&\dot{\bf j}&\dot{\bf k} \\ 3&-4&5\\ -2&1&-3\end{vmatrix}=7\dot{\bf i}-\dot{\bf j}-5\dot{\bf k}\)

Note \(\dot{\bf b}\times{\bf a}=-7\dot{\bf i}+\dot{\bf j}+5\dot{\bf k}\)

### Angular Velocity And Its Relation With Linear Velocity

In this section we shall study what is angular velocity and its role in rotational motion. We have seen that every particle of a rotating body moves in a circle. The linear velocity of the particle is related to the angular velocity. The relation between these two quantities involves a vector product which we learnt about in the last section.

Let us go back to Fig. 7.4. As said above, in rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius of the circle is \(r\), the perpendicular distance of the point P from the axis. We also show the linear velocity vector \(\mathbf{v}\) of the particle at P. It is along the tangent at P to the circle.

Let P' be the position of the particle after an interval of time \(\Delta t\) [Fig. 7.16]. The angle PCP' describes the angular displacement \(\Delta\theta\) of the particle in time \(\Delta t\). The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval \(\Delta t\) is \(\Delta\theta/\Delta t\). As \(\Delta t\) tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller values), the ratio \(\Delta\theta/\Delta t\) approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity \(\mathrm{d}\theta/\mathrm{d}t\) of the particle at the position P. We denote the instantaneous angular velocity by \(\omega\) (the Greek letter omega). We know from our study of circular motion that the magnitude of linear velocity \(v\) of a particle moving in a circle is related to the angular velocity of the particle \(\omega\) by the simple relation '\(v=\omega r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

We observe that at any given instant the relation '\(v=\omega r\) applies to all particles of the rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular distance \(r_{i}\) from the fixed axis, the linear velocity at a given instant \(v_{i}\) is given by

\[\omega=d\theta/dt\quad\mbox{\raisebox{-2.15pt}{$\stackrel{{ v_{i}}}{{v}}=\omega r_{i}$}} \tag{7.19}\]

The index \(t\) runs from 1 to \(n\), where \(n\) is the total number of particles of the body.

For particles on the axis, \(\mathbf{r=0}\), and hence \(v=\omega r=0\). Thus, particles on the axis are stationary. This verifies that the axis is _fixed_.

Note that we use the same angular velocity \(a\) for all the particles. **We therefore, refer to \(\omega\) as the angular velocity of the whole body. We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time.** Note that this characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis is **just another way** of saying as in Sec. 7.1 that each particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has the centre on the axis.

In our discussion so far the angular velocity appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept it. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular velocity vector lies along the axis of rotation, and points out in the direction in which a right handed screw would advance, if the head of the screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7.17a).

The magnitude of this vector is referred as above.

We shall now look at what the vector product \(\omega\times\mathbf{r}\) corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7.17b) which is a part of Fig. 7.17c reproduced to show the path of the particle P. The figure shows the vector \(\omega\) directed along the fixed (z-) axis and also the position vector \(\mathbf{r=OP}\) of the particle at P of the rigid body with respect to the origin O. Note that the origin is chosen to be on the axis of rotation.

Figure 7.17: (a) If the head of a right handed screw rotates with the body, the screw advances in the direction of the angular velocity \(a\) if the sense (clockwise or anticlockwise) of rotation of the body changes, so does the direction of \(\omega\)

The vector is perpendicular to \(\omega\) i.e. to \(\mathbf{CP}\), the z-axis and also to the radius of the circle described by the particle at P. It is therefore, along the tangent to the circle at P. Also, the magnitude of \(\omega\times\mathbf{CP}\) is \(\omega\)(CP) since \(\omega\) and \(\mathbf{CP}\) are perpendicular to each other. We shall denote \(\mathbf{CP}\) by \(\mathbf{r}_{\perp}\) and not by \(\mathbf{r}\), as we did earlier.

Thus, \(\omega\times\mathbf{r}\) is a vector of magnitude \(\dot{\omega}_{\perp}\) and is along the tangent to the circle described by the particle at P. The linear velocity vector \(\mathbf{v}\) at P has the same magnitude and direction. Thus,

\[\mathbf{v}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{r} \tag{7.20}\]

In fact, the relation, Eq. (7.20), holds good even for rotation of a rigid body with one point fixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 7.6(a)]. In this case \(\mathbf{r}\) represents the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed point taken as the origin.

We note that **for rotation about a fixed axis, the direction of the vector \(\omega\) does not change with time. Its magnitude may, however, change from instant to instant. For the more general rotation, both the magnitude and the direction of \(\omega\) may change from instant to instant.**

#### Angular acceleration

You may have noticed that we are developing the study of rotational motion along the lines of the study of translational motion with which we are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic variables of linear displacement and velocity (\(\mathbf{v}\)) in translational motion, we have angular displacement and angular velocity (\(\boldsymbol{\omega}\)) in rotational motion. It is then natural to define in rotational motion the concept of angular acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration defined as the time rate of change of velocity in translational motion. We define angular acceleration \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\) as the time rate of change of angular velocity; Thus,

\[\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\omega}}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{7.21}\]

If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction of \(\boldsymbol{\omega}\) and hence, that of \(\alpha\) is fixed. In this case the vector equation reduces to a scalar equation \(\cdot\)

\[\alpha=\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{7.22}\]

### Torque and angular momentum

In this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with two physical quantities which are defined as vector products of two vectors. These as we shall see, are especially important in the discussion of motion of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.

#### Moment of force (Torque)

We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body in general is a combination of rotation and translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along a line, it has only rotational motion. We know that force is needed to change the translational state of a body, i.e. to produce linear acceleration. We may then ask, what is the analogue of force in the case of rotational motion? To look into the question in a concrete situation let us take the example of opening or closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing through the hinges. What makes the door rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied the door does not rotate. But any force does not do the job. A force applied to the hinge line cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a force of given magnitude applied at rightangles to the door at its outer edge is most effective in producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion.

The rotational analogue of force is **moment of force**. It is also referred to as **torque**. (We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.) We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle. Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is angular acceleration of a rigid body.

If a force acts on a single particle at a point P whose position with respect to the origin O is given by the position vector **r** (Fig. 7.18), the moment of the force acting on the particle with respect to the origin O is defined as the vector product

\[\tau=r\times F \tag{7.23}\]

The moment of force (or torque) is a vector quantity. The symbol \(\tau\) stands for the Greek letter **tau**. The magnitude of \(\tau\) is

\[\tau=rF\sin\theta \tag{7.24a}\]

where \(r\) is the magnitude of the position vector **r**, i.e. the length OP, \(F\) is the magnitude of force **F** and \(\theta\) is the angle between **r** and **F** as shown.

Moment of force has dimensions M L\({}^{2}\) T\({}^{a}\). Its dimensions are the same as those of work or energy. Its, however, a very different physical quantity than work. Moment of a force is a vector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of moment of force is Newton-metre (Nm). The magnitude of the moment of force may be written

\[\tau=(r\sin\theta)F=r_{\rm L}F \tag{7.24b}\]

or \[\tau=rF\sin\theta=rF_{\rm L}\] (7.24c)

where \(r_{\rm L}=r\sin\theta\) is the perpendicular distance of the line of action of **F** form the origin and \(F_{\rm L}=F\sin\theta\) is the component of **F** in the direction perpendicular to **r**. Note that \(\tau=0\) if \(r=0\), \(F=0\) or \(\theta=0^{\rm o}\) or \(180^{\rm o}\). Thus, the moment of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of the force is zero, or if the line of action of the force passes through the origin.

One may note that since \(r\times F\) is a vector product, properties of a vector product of two vectors apply to it. If the direction of **F** is reversed, the direction of the moment of force is reversed. If directions of both **r** and **F** are reversed, the direction of the moment of force remains the same.

#### 7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle

Just as the moment of a force is the rotational analogue of force, the quantity angular momentum is the rotational analogue of linear momentum. We shall first define angular momentum for the special case of a single particle and look at its usefulness in the context of single particle motion. We shall then extend the definition of angular momentum to systems of particles including rigid bodies.

Like moment of a force, angular momentum is also a vector product. It could also be referred to as moment of (linear) momentum. From this term one could guess how angular momentum is defined.

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) and linear momentum **p** at a position **r** relative to the origin O. The angular momentum **l** of the particle with respect to the origin O is defined to be

\[1=r\times p \tag{7.25a}\]

The magnitude of the angular momentum vector is

\[I=r\,psin\theta \tag{7.26a}\]

where \(p\) is the magnitude of **p** and \(\theta\) is the angle between **r** and **p**. We may write

\[\mbox{or }r_{\rm L}p \tag{7.26b}\]

where \(r_{\rm L}\) (\(=r\sin\theta\)) is the perpendicular distance of the directional line of **p** from the origin and \(p_{\rm L}=p\sin\theta\) is the component of **p** in a direction perpendicular to **r**. We expect the angular momentum to be zero (\(l=0\)), if the linear momentum vanishes (\(p=0\)), if the particle is at the origin (\(r=0\)), or if the directional line of **p** passes through the origin \(\theta=0^{\rm o}\) or \(180^{\rm o}\).

_Answer_ Let the particle with velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) be at point P at some instant \(t\). We want to calculate the angular momentum of the particle about an arbitrary point O.

_Fig 7.19_

The angular momentum is \(\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{v}\). Its magnitude is \(mvr\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) as shown in Fig. 7.19. Although the particle changes position with time, the line of direction of \(\mathbf{v}\) remains the same and hence OM = \(r\sin\theta\). is a constant.

Further, the direction of \(\mathbf{1}\) is perpendicular to the plane of \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). It is into the page of the figure.This direction does not change with time.

Thus, \(\mathbf{1}\) remains the same in magnitude and direction and is therefore conserved. Is there any external torque on the particle? \(\blacktriangle\)

### Eguilibrium of a rigid body

We are now going to concentrate on the motion of rigid bodies rather than on the motion of general systems of particles.

We shall recapitulate what effect the external forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth we shall omit the adjective 'external' because unless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only external forces and torques.) The forces change the translational state of the motion of the rigid body, i.e. they change its total linear momentum in accordance with Eq. (7.17). But this is not the only effect the forces have. The total torque on the body may not vanish. Such a torque changes the rotational state of motion of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular momentum of the body in accordance with Eq. (7.28 b).

A rigid body is said to be in mechanical equilibrium, if both its linear momentum and angular momentum are not changing with time, or equivalently, the body has neither linear acceleration nor angular acceleration. This means

1. the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the forces, on the rigid body is zero;. \[\mathbf{F}_{1}+\mathbf{F}_{2}+...+\mathbf{F}_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{F}_{i}= \mathbf{0}\] (7.30a) If the total force on the body is zero, then the total linear momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7.30 a) gives the condition for the translational equilibrium of the body.
2. The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the torques on the rigid body is zero,. \[\mathbf{\tau}_{1}+\mathbf{\tau}_{2}+...+\mathbf{\tau}_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{ \tau}_{i}=\mathbf{0}\] (7.30b) If the total torque on the rigid body is zero, the total angular momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7.30 b) gives the condition for the rotational equilibrium of the body.

One may raise a question, whether the rotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7.30[b]] remains valid, if the origin with respect to which the torques are taken is shifted. One can show that if the translational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7.30[a]] holds for a rigid body, then such a shift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational equilibrium condition is independent of the location of the origin about which the torques are taken. Example 7.7 gives a proof of this result in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces acting on a rigid body in translational equilibrium. The generalisation of this result to \(n\) forces is left as an exercise.

Eq. (7.30a) and Eq. (7.30b), both, are vector equations. They are equivalent to three scalar equations each. Eq. (7.30a) corresponds to

\[\overset{\cdot}{\sum}_{i=1}^{n}F_{x}-0\overset{\cdot}{,}\overset{\cdot}{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}F_{y}-0\text{ and }\overset{\cdot}{\sum}_{i=1}^{n}F_{x}-0\] (7.31a) where \[F_{x}\], \[F_{y}\]  and \[F_{x}\] are respectively the \[x\], \[y\] and \[z\] components of the forces \[\mathbf{F}_{i}\] Similarly, Eq. (7.30b) is equivalent to three scalar equations \[\overset{\cdot}{\sum}_{i=1}^{n}\tau_{x}=0\overset{\cdot}{,}\overset{\cdot}{ \sum}_{i=1}^{n}\tau_{y}=0\text{ and }\overset{\cdot}{\sum}_{i=1}^{n}\tau_{x}=0\] (7.31b) where \[\tau_{x}\], \[\tau_{y}\]  and \[\tau_{x}\] are respectively the \[x\], \[y\] and \[z\] components of the torque \[\tau_{i}\].

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:159]

**Example 7.7**: Show that moment of a couple does not depend on the point about which you take the moments.

Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 7.22 acting on a rigid body. The forces **F** and -**F** act respectively at points B and A. These points have position vectors **r\({}_{{}_{1}}\)** and **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\)** with respect to origin O. Let us take the moments of the forces about the origin.

The moment of the couple = sum of the moments of the two forces making the couple

= **r\({}_{{}_{1}}\times\)**(-**F**) + **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\times\)****F**

= **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\times\)****F**

= **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\)**\(\times\)****F**

But **r\({}_{{}_{1}}\)**+**AB** = **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\)**, and hence **AB** = **r\({}_{{}_{2}}\)**-**r\({}_{{}_{1}}\)**.

The moment of the couple, therefore, is **AB**\(\times\)****F**.

Clearly this is independent of the origin. the point about which we took the moments of the forces.

#### Principle of moments

An ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its length. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-saw on the chllren's playground is a typical example of a lever. Two forces _F\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_ and _F\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_, parallel to each other and usually perpendicular to the lever, as shown here, act on the lever at distances _d\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_ and _d\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_ respectively from the fulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23.

The lever is a system in mechanical equilibrium. Let **R** be the reaction of the support at the fulcrum; **R** is directed opposite to the forces _F\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_ and _F\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_. For translational equilibrium,

\[R-F_{{}_{1}}-F_{{}_{2}}=0\] (i)

For considering rotational equilibrium we take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum of moments must be zero,

\[d_{{}_{1}}F_{{}_{1}}-d_{{}_{2}}F_{{}_{2}}=0\] (ii)

Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise) moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note \(R\) acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment about the fulcrum.

In the case of the lever force _F\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_ is usually some weight to be lifted. It is called the _lo\(\alpha\)d_ and its distance from the fulcrum _d\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_ is called the _lo\(\alpha\)d_arm_. Force _F\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_ is the _effort_ applied to lift the load; distance _d\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_ of the effort from the fulcrum is the _effort_arm

Eq. (ii) can be written as

\[d_{{}_{1}}F_{{}_{1}}=d_{{}_{2}}F_{{}_{2}}\] (7.32a) or load arm \[\times\] load = effort arm \[\times\] effort

The above equation expresses the principle of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio _F\({}_{{}_{1}}\)_/_F\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_ is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);

\[\mbox{M.A.}=\frac{F_{{}_{1}}}{F_{{}_{2}}}=\frac{d_{{}_{2}}}{d_{{}_{1}}} \tag{7.32b}\]

If the effort arm _d\({}_{{}_{2}}\)_ is larger than the load arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than one. Mechanical advantage greater than one means that a small effort can be used to lift a large load. There are several examples of a lever around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a balance is a lever. Try to find more such

Figure 7.21: The Earth’s magnetic field exerts equal and opposite forces on the poles of a compass needle. These two forces form a couple.

Figure 7.22:examples and identify the fulrum, the effort and effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the lever in each case.

You may easily show that the principle of moment holds even when the parallel forces \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) are not perpendicular, but act at some angle, to the lever.

#### 7.8.2 Centre of gravity

Many of you may have the experience of balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger. Figure 7.24 illustrates a similar experiment that you can easily perform. Take an irregular-shaped cardboard and a narrow tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial and error a point G on the cardboard where it can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The cardboard remains horizontal in this position.) This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG) of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides a vertically upward force due to which the cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As shown in the Fig. 7.24, the reaction of the tip is equal and opposite to Mg, the total weight of (i.e., the force of gravity on) the cardboard and hence the cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so, due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and fall. There are torques on the card board due to the forces of gravity like \(m_{\mbox{g}}\), \(m_{\mbox{g}}\),... etc, acting on the individual particles that make up the cardboard.

The CG of the cardboard is so located that the total torque on it due to the forces \(m_{\mbox{i}}\), \(m_{\mbox{g}}\),... etc. is zero.

If \(\mbox{\bf r}_{i}\) is the position vector of the \(i\)th particle of an extended body with respect to its CG, then the torque about the CG, due to the force of gravity on the particle \(\mbox{\bf is }\mbox{\bf r}_{i}=\mbox{\bf r}_{i}\times m_{\mbox{g}}\). The total gravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.

\[\mbox{\bf\char 126}_{\mbox{g}}=\sum\mbox{\bf r}_{i}=\sum\mbox{\bf r}_{i}\times m _{i}\mbox{g}=\mbox{0} \tag{7.33}\]

We may therefore, define the CG of a body as that point where the total gravitational torque on the body is zero.

We notice that in Eq. (7.33), g is the same for all particles, and hence it comes out of the summation. This gives, since g is nonzero, \(\sum m_{i}\mbox{\bf r}_{i}=\mbox{0}\). Remember that the position vectors (**r**) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in accordance with the reasoning given below Eq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7.2, if the sum is zero, the origin must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus, the centre of gravity of the body coincides with the centre of mass. We note that this is true because the body being small, g does not

centre with angular velocity \(\omega\) Each mass element of the ring is at a distance R from the axis, and moves with a speed \(Ra\) The kinetic energy is therefore, \(\cdot\). \(K=\frac{1}{2}\,Mv^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\,MR^{2}\omega^{2}\) Comparing with Eq. (7.35) we get \(I=MR^{2}\) for the ring. \(\cdot\) Next, take a rigid massless rod of length \(l\) with a pair of small masses, rotating about an axis through the centre of mass of the system and perpendicular to the rod. The total mass of the system is \(M\). \(\cdot\) Next, take a rigid massless rod of length \(l\) with a pair of small masses, rotating about an axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7.28). Each mass \(M/2\) is at a distance \(l/2\) from the axis. The moment of inertia of the masses is therefore given by \((M/2)\,(l/2)\,(l/2)^{2}\) Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about the axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod \(I=M^{2}\,/\,4\) Table 7.1 gives the moment of inertia of various familiar regular shaped solids about specific axes. As the mass of a body resists a change in its state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia in linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of inertia about a given axis of rotation resists a change in its rotational motion, it can be regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of the body; it is a measure of the way in which different parts of the body are distributed at different distances from the axis. Unlike the mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a fixed quantity but depends on the orientation and position of the axis of rotation with respect to the body as a whole. As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the **radius of gyration**. It is related to the moment of inertia and the total mass of the body. Notice from the Table 7.1 that in all cases, we can write \(I=Mk^{2}\), where \(k\) has the dimension of length. For a rod, about the perpendicular axis at its midpoint, \(k^{2}=L^{2}/12\), i.e. \(k^{2}=L/\sqrt{12}\). Similarly, \(k=R/2\) for the circular disc about its diameter. The length \(k\) is a geometric property of the body and axis of rotation. It is called the **radius of gyration**. The radius of gyration of a body about an axis may be defined as the distance from the axis of a mass point whose mass is equal to the mass of the whole body and whose moment of inertia is equal to the moment of inertia of the body about the axis. Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body depends on the mass of the body, its shape and size; distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the position and orientation of the axis of rotation. From the definition, Eq. (7.34), we can infer that the dimensions of moments of inertia we ML\({}^{2}\) and its SI units are kg m\({}^{2}\). The property of this extremely important quantity \(I\) as a measure of rotational inertia of the body has been put to a great practical use. The machines, such as steam engine and the automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational motion have a disc with a large moment of inertia, called a **flywheel**. Because of its large moment of inertia, the flywheel resists the sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle. \(\cdot\)

### theorems of perpendicular and parallel axes

These are two useful theorems relating to moment of inertia. We shall first discuss the theorem of perpendicular axes and its simple yet instructive application in working out the moments of inertia of some regular-shaped bodies.

Figure 7.28: A light rod of length \(l\) with a pair of masses rotating about an axis through the centre of mass of the system and perpendicular to the rod. The total mass of the system is \(M\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Theorem of perpendicularaxes**} \\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{**This theorem is applicable to bodies which are planar. In practice this means the theorem applies to flat bodies whose thickness is very small compared to their other dimensions (e.g. length, breadth or radius). Fig. 7.29 illustrates the theorem. It states that the moment of inertia of a planar body (lamina) about an axis perpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum of its moments of inertia about two perpendicularaxes concurrent with perpendicular axis and lying in the plane of the body.** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7.1: **Moments of Inertia of some regular shaped bodies about specific axes**The figure shows a planar body. An axis perpendicular to the body through a point O is taken as the z-axis. Two mutually perpendicular axes lying in the plane of the body and concurrent with z-axis, i.e. passing through O, are taken as the \(x\) and \(y\)-axes. The theorem states that

\[I_{x}=I_{x}+I_{y} \tag{7.36}\]

Let us look at the usefulness of the theorem through an example.

What is the moment of inertia of a disc about one of its diameters?

_Answer_ We assume the moment of inertia of the disc about an axis perpendicular to it and through its centre to be known; it is \(MR^{2}/2\), where M is the mass of the disc and \(R\) is its radius (Table 7.1)

The disc can be considered to be a planar body. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes is applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7.30, we take three concurrent axes through the centre of the disc, O as the \(x,y,z\) axes; \(x\) and \(y\)-axes lie in the plane of the disc and \(z\) is perpendicular to it. By the theorem of perpendicular axes,

\[I_{x}=I_{x}+I_{y}\]

Now, \(x\) and \(y\) axes are along two diameters of the disc, and by symmetry the moment of inertia of the disc is the same about any diameter. Hence

\[I_{x}=I_{y}\]

and \[I_{z}=2I_{x}\]

But \[I_{x}=MR^{2}/2\]

So finally, \[I_{x}=I_{x}/2=MR^{2}/4\]

Thus the moment of inertia of a disc about any of its diameter is \(MR^{2}/4\)...

Find similarly the moment of inertia of a ring about any of its diameter. Will the theorem be applicable to a solid cylinder?

fixed, there is no need to treat angular velocity as a vector. Further, the angular acceleration, \(\alpha=d\omega/dt\).

The kinematical quantities in rotational motion, angular displacement (\(\theta\)), angular velocity (\(\omega\)) and angular acceleration (\(\alpha\)) respectively correspond to kinematic quantities in linear motion, displacement (\(x\)), velocity (\(v\)) and acceleration (\(\alpha\)). We know the kinematical equations of linear motion with uniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:

\(v=v_{0}+at\). \(x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\). \(v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2\alpha x\) (c)

where \(x_{0}=\) initial displacement and \(v_{0}=\) initial velocity. The word 'initial' refers to values of the quantities at \(t=0\)

The corresponding kinematic equations for rotational motion with uniform angular acceleration are:

\(\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t\). \(\theta=\theta_{0}+\alpha bt+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^{2}\) (7.39) \(\mathrm{and}\dot{\omega}^{2}=\omega_{0}^{2}+2\alpha(\theta-\theta_{0})\) (7.40)

where \(\theta_{0}=\) initial angular displacement of the rotating body, and \(\omega_{0}=\) initial angular velocity of the body.

_Example 7.13_: Obtain Eq. (7.38) from first principles.

_Answer_: The angular acceleration is uniform, hence

\[\frac{d\omega}{dt}=\alpha=constant\] (i)

Integrating this equation,

\(\omega=\int\alpha\,\mathrm{d}t+c\). \(\mathrm{=}\alpha t+c\) (as \(\alpha\)is constant)

At \(t=0\), \(\omega=\omega_{0}\) (given)

From (i) we get at \(t=0\), \(\omega=c=\omega_{0}\)

Thus, \(\omega=\alpha t+\omega_{0}\) as required.

With the definition of \(\omega=d\theta/dt\) we may integrate Eq. (7.38) to get Eq. (7.39). This derivation and the derivation of Eq. (7.40) is left as an exercise.

_Example 7.14_: The angular speed of a motor wheel is increased from 1200 rpm to 3120 rpm in 16 seconds. (i) What is its angular acceleration, assuming the acceleration to be uniform? (ii) How many revolutions does the engine make during this time?

_Answer_:
**(i)**: **We shall use** \(\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t\)
**(ii)**: **We shall use** \(\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t\)
**(iii)**: **We shall use** \(\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t\)
**(iv)**: **We shall use** \(\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t\)
**(v)**: **Initial angular speed in rad/s**
**(v)**: **The angular speed in rad/s**
The angular acceleration of the engine = 4\(\pi\) rad/s\({}^{2}\)

(ii) The angular displacement in time \(t\) is given by

\(\theta=\omega_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}\,\alpha t^{2}\)

Number of revolutions = \(\frac{1152\pi}{2\pi}\)=576

### DYNAMICS of Rotational Motion About a Fixed Axis

Table 7.2 lists quantities a associated with linear motion and their analogues in rotational motion. We have already compared kinematics of the two motions. Also, we know that in rotational motion moment of inertia and torque play the same role as mass and force respectively in linear motion. Given this we should be able to guess what the other analogues indicated in the table are. For example, we know that in linear motion, work done is given by _Fdx_, in rotational motion about a fixed axis it should be _'d\(\theta\)_. since we already know the correspondence \(\mathrm{d}x\to\mathrm{d}\theta\) and \(F\to r\). It is, however, necessary that these correspondences are established on sound dynamical considerations. This is what we now turn to.

Before we begin, we note _a simplification that arises in the case of rotational motion about a fixed axis_. Since the axis is fixed. only those components of torques, which are along the direction of the fixed axis need to be considered in our discussion. Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis. A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position. We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the (external) torques. so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained. The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account. This means that for our calculation of torques on a rigid body:

1. We need to consider only those forces that lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Forces which are parallel to the axis will give torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account.
2. We need to consider only those components of the position vectors which are perpendicular to the axis. Components of position vectors along the axis will result in torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account.

Figure 7.34 shows a cross-section of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the page; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to consider only those forces which lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Let \(\mathbf{F}_{1}\) be one such typical force acting as shown on a particle of the body at point \(\mathrm{P}_{1}\) with its line of action in a plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience we call this to be the \(x^{\prime}\!-\!y^{\prime}\) plane (coincident with the plane of the page). The particle at \(\mathrm{P}_{1}\) describes a circular path of radius \(r_{1}\) with centre \(\mathrm{C}\) on the axis; \(\mathrm{CP}_{1}=r_{1}\).

In time \(\Delta t\), the point moves to the position \(\mathrm{P}_{1}\), \(\cdot\) The displacement of the particle \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{1}\), \(\cdot\) therefore, has magnitude \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{1}=r_{1}\mathrm{d}\theta\) and direction tangential at \(\mathrm{P}_{1}\) to the circular path as shown. Here \(\mathrm{d}\theta\) is the angular displacement of the particle. \(\mathrm{d}\theta=ZP_{1}\mathrm{CP}_{1}^{\prime}\).The work done by the force on the particle is

\(\mathrm{d}W_{1}=\mathbf{F}_{1}\). \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{1}=F_{1}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{1}\,\cos\phi_{1}=F_{1}[r_ {1}\,\mathrm{d}\theta)\mathrm{sin}\alpha_{1}\)

where \(\phi_{1}\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{F}_{1}\) and the tangent at \(P_{{}_{1}}\), and \(\alpha_{{}_{1}}\) is the angle between \(F_{{}_{1}}\) and the radius vector \(OP_{{}_{1}}\): \(\phi_{{}_{1}}+\alpha_{{}_{1}}=90^{\circ}\).

The torque due to \(F_{{}_{1}}\) about the origin is \(OP_{{}_{1}}\times F_{{}_{1}}\). Now \(OP_{{}_{1}}=OC+OP_{{}_{1}}\). [Refer to Fig. 7.17(b).] Since \(OC\) is along the axis, the torque resulting from it is excluded from our consideration. The effective torque due to \(F_{{}_{1}}\) is \(\tau_{{}_{1}}=CP\times F_{{}_{1}}\); it is directed along the axis of rotation and has a magnitude \(\tau_{{}_{1}}=r_{{}_{1}}F_{{}_{1}}\sin\alpha\). Therefore,

\(dW_{{}_{1}}=\tau_{{}_{1}}d\theta\)

If there are more than one forces acting on the body, the work done by all of them can be added to give the total work done on the body. Denoting the magnitudes of the torques due to the different forces as \(\tau_{{}_{1}}\), \(\tau_{{}_{2}}\),... etc,

\({}^{\cdot}dW=(\tau_{{}_{1}}+\tau_{{}_{2}}+...)d\theta\)

Remember, the forces giving rise to the torques act on different particles, but the angular displacement \(d\theta\) is the same for all particles. Since all the torques considered are parallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude \(\tau\) of the total torque is just the algebraic sum of the magnitudes of the torques, i.e., \(\tau=\tau_{{}_{1}}+\tau_{{}_{2}}+....\). We, therefore, have

\(dW=rd\theta\)

This expression gives the work done by the total (external) torque \(\tau\) which acts on the body rotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with the corresponding expression

\(dW\)= \(Fds\)

for linear (translational) motion is obvious.

Dividing both sides of Eq. (7.41) by \(d\iota\) gives \(\cdot\)

\(P=\frac{dW}{dt}=\tau\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\varpi\)

or \(P=\varpi\)

This is the instantaneous power. Compare this expression for power in the case of rotational motion about a fixed axis with the expression for power in the case of linear motion, \(P=Fv\)

In a perfectly rigid body there is no internal motion. The work done by external torques is therefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase the kinetic energy of the body. The rate at which work is done on the body is given by Eq. (7.42). This is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic energy increases. The rate of increase of kinetic energy is

\(\frac{\cdot}{dt}\left(\frac{I\omega^{2}}{2}\right)=I\frac{(2\omega)}{2}\frac {d\omega}{dt}\)

We assume that the moment of inertia does not change with time. This means that the mass of the body does not change, the body remains rigid and also the axis does not change its position with respect to the body.

Since \(\alpha=d\omega/dt\), we get

\(\cdot\)

\(\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{I\omega^{2}}{2}\right)=I\omega\alpha\)

Equating rates of work done and of increase in kinetic energy,

\(\cdot\varpi=I\omega\alpha\)

Further, \(\mathbf{v}\) is tangential at P to the circle which the particle describes. Using the right-hand rule one can check that \(\mathbf{CP}\times\mathbf{v}\) is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit vector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z-axis) is \(\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\). Hence

\[\mathbf{CP}\times m\ \mathbf{v}= r_{\perp}\left(mw\right)\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\] \[= m_{\perp}^{2}\omega\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\ \left(\mathrm{since}\ \dot{v}=wr_{\perp}\right)\]

Similarly, we can check that \(\mathbf{OC}\times\mathbf{v}\) is perpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote the part of \(\mathbf{1}\) along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis) by \(\mathbf{l}_{z}\), then

\[\mathbf{l}_{z}=\mathbf{CP}\times m\ \mathbf{v}=mr_{\perp}^{2}\omega\mathbf{ \frac{L}{L}}\]

and \(\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{l}_{z}+\mathbf{OC}\times m\ \mathbf{v}\)

We note that \(\mathbf{l}_{z}\) is parallel to the fixed axis, but \(\mathbf{l}\) is not. In general, for a particle, the angular momentum \(\mathbf{l}\) is not along the axis of rotation, i.e. for a particle, \(\mathbf{1}\) and \(\omega\) are not necessarily parallel. Compare this with the corresponding fact in translation. For a particle, \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) are always parallel to each other.

For computing the total angular momentum of the whole rigid body, we add up the contribution of each particle of the body.

Thus \(\mathbf{L}=\sum\mathbf{l}_{z}=\sum l_{w}+\sum\mathbf{OC}_{\perp}\times m_{z} \mathbf{v}_{\perp}\)

We denote by \(\mathbf{L}_{\perp}\) and \(\mathbf{L}_{z}\) the components of \(\mathbf{L}\) respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and along the z-axis;

\[\mathbf{L}_{\perp}=\sum\mathbf{OC}_{\perp}\times m_{z}\mathbf{v}_{\perp}\] (7.44a) where \[m_{\perp}\] and \[\mathbf{v}_{\perp}\] are respectively the mass and the velocity of the \[t^{\perp}\] particle and \[\mathbf{C}_{\perp}\] is the centre of the circle described by the particle; \[\mathbf{L}_{z}=\sum\mathbf{l}_{w}=\left(\sum_{\perp}\ m_{z}t_{\perp}^{2}\right)\omega \mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\] or \[\mathbf{L}_{z}=I\omega\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}} \tag{7.44b}\]

The last step follows since the perpendicular distance of the \(t^{\perp}\) particle from the axis is \(r_{\perp}\); and by definition the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation is \(I=\sum m_{z}r_{\perp}^{2}\).

Note \(\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_{z}+\mathbf{L}_{\perp}\) (7.44c)

The rigid bodies which we have mainly considered in this chapter are symmetric about the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is one of their symmetry axes. For such bodies, for a given \(\mathbf{OC}_{\perp}\) for every particle which has a velocity \(\mathbf{v}_{\perp}\), there is another particle of velocity \(-\mathbf{v}_{\perp}\) located diametrically opposite on the circle with centre \(C_{\perp}\) described by the particle. Together such pairs will contribute zero to \(\mathbf{L}_{\perp}\) and as a result for symmetric bodies \(\mathbf{L}_{\perp}\) is zero, and hence

\[\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_{z}=I\omega\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}} \tag{7.44d}\]

For bodies, which are not symmetric about the axis of rotation, \(\mathbf{L}\) is not equal to \(\mathbf{L}_{z}\) and hence \(\mathbf{L}\) does not lie along the axis of rotation.

Referring to table 7.1, can you tell in which cases \(\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_{z}\) will not apply?

Let us differentiate Eq. (7.44b). Since \(\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\) is a fixed (constant) vector, we get

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\mathbf{L}_{z})=\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{ \mathrm{d}t}(I\omega)\right)\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\]

Now, Eq. (7.28b) states

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\]

As we have seen in the last section, only those components of the external torques which are along the axis of rotation, need to be taken into account, when we discuss rotation about a fixed axis. This means we can take \(\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}=\mathbf{L}_{z}+\mathbf{L}_{\perp}\) and the direction of \(\mathbf{L}_{z}\)(vector \(\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\)) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a fixed axis,

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}_{z}}{\mathrm{d}t}=r\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}} \tag{7.45a}\] \[\cdot\] and \[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}_{\perp}}{\mathrm{d}t}=0 \tag{7.45b}\]

Thus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the fixed axis is constant. As \(\mathbf{L}_{z}=I\omega\mathbf{\frac{L}{L}}\), we get from Eq. (7.45a),

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(I\omega)=\tau \tag{7.45c}\]If the moment of inertia \(I\) does not change with time,

\[\frac{\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{d}t}(I\omega)=I\frac{\mathbf{d}\omega}{\mathbf{d}t}=I\alpha\]

and we get from Eq. (7.45c),

\[\tau=I\alpha \tag{7.43}\]

We have already derived this equation using the work - kinetic energy route.

#### 7.13.1 Conservation ofangular momentum

We are now in a position to revisit the principle of conservation of angular momentum in the context of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq. (7.45c), if the external torque is zero,

\[L_{\mathrm{r}}=I\omega=\mathrm{constant} \tag{7.46}\]

For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7.44d), \(L_{\mathrm{r}}\) may be replaced by \(L\).(\(L\) and \(L_{\mathrm{r}}\) are respectively the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{L}\) and \(L_{\mathrm{r}}\).)

This then is the required form, for fixed axis rotation, of Eq. (7.29a), which expresses the general law of conservation of angular momentum of a system of particles. Eq. (7.46) applies to many situations that we come across in daily life. You may do this experiment with your friend. Sit on a swivel chair with your arms folded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from, the ground. Ask your friend to rotate the chair rapidly. While the chair is rotating with considerable angular speed stretch your arms horizontally. What happens? Your angular speed is reduced. If you bring back your arms closer toyour body, the angular speed increases again. This is a situation where the principle of conservation of angular momentum is applicable. If friction in the rotational mechanism is neglected, there is no external torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and hence \(I\omega\) is constant. Stretching the arms increases \(I\) about the axis of rotation, resulting in decreasing the angular speed \(\omega\). Bringing the arms closer to the body has the opposite effect.

A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage of this principle. Also, skaters and classical, Indian or western, dancers performing a pirouette on the toes of one foot display'mastery' over this principle. Can you explain?

### Rolling motion

One of the most common motions observed in daily life is the rolling motion. All wheels used in transportation have rolling motion. For specificness we shall begin with the case of a disc, but the result will apply to any rolling body rolling on a level surface. We shall assume that the disc rolls without slipping. This means that at any instant of time the bottom of the disc which is in contact with the surface is at rest on the surface.

Figure 7.36: An acrobat employing the principle of consensus creation of angular momentum in her performance.

We have remarked earlier that rolling motion is a combination of rotation and translation. We know that the translational motion of a system of particles is the motion of its centre of mass.

Let \(\textbf{v}_{cm}\) be the velocity of the centre of mass and therefore the translational velocity of the disc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc is at its geometric centre C [Fig. 37], \(\textbf{v}_{cm}\)is the velocity of C. It is parallel to the level surface. The rotational motion of the disc is about its symmetry axis, which passes through C. Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc, like \(\text{P}_{0}\), \(\text{P}_{1}\) or \(\text{P}_{2}\), consists of two parts, one is the translational velocity \(\textbf{v}_{cm}\) and the other is the linear velocity \(\textbf{v}_{r}\) on account of rotation. The magnitude of \(\textbf{v}_{r}\)is \(v_{r}=\alpha\) where \(\alpha\)is the angular velocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis and \(r\) is the distance of the point from the axis (i.e. from C). The velocity \(\textbf{v}_{r}\)is directed perpendicular to the radius vector of the given point with respect to C. In Fig. 37, the velocity of the point \(\text{P}_{2}\) [\(\textbf{v}_{2}\)] and its components \(\textbf{v}_{r}\)and \(\textbf{v}_{cm}\)are shown: \(\textbf{v}_{r}\)here is perpendicular to \(\text{CP}_{2}\). It is easy to show that \(\textbf{v}_{z}\)is perpendicular to the line \(\text{P}_{0}\text{P}_{2}\). Therefore the line passing through \(\text{P}_{0}\) and parallel to \(\omega\)is called the instantaneous axis of rotation.

At \(\text{P}_{0}\), the line ar velocity, \(\textbf{v}_{r}\), due to rotation is directed exactly opposite to the translational velocity \(\textbf{v}_{cm}\). Further the magnitude of \(\textbf{v}_{r}\)here is \(Ra\) where \(R\) is the radius of the disc. The condition that \(\text{P}_{0}\)is instantaneously at rest requires \(v_{cm}=Ra\)Thus for the disc the condition for rolling without slipping is

\[\text{(\ref{v}_{r})} \tag{7.47}\]

Incidentally, this means that the velocity of point \(\text{P}_{1}\)at the top of the disc (\(\textbf{v}_{r}\))has a magnitude \(v_{cm}+Ra\)or \(2\)\(v_{cm}\)and is directed parallel to the level surface. The condition (7.47) applies to all rolling bodies.

#### Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion

Our next task will be to obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated into kinetic energy of translation and kinetic energy of rotation. This is a special case of a general result for a system of particles, according to which the kinetic energy of a system of particles (\(K\))can be separated into the kinetic energy of motion of the centre of mass (translation) (\(MV^{2}/2\)) and kinetic energy of rotational motion about the centre of mass of the system of particles (\(K^{\prime}\)). Thus,

\[K=K^{\prime}+MV^{2}/2 \tag{7.48}\]

We assume this general result (see Exercise 7.31), and apply it to the case of rolling motion. In our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre of mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation, of the rolling body is \(mv_{cm}^{2}/2\), where \(m\)is the mass of the body and \(v_{cm}\)is the centre of the mass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling body about the centre of mass is rotation, \(K^{\prime}\) represents the kinetic energy of rotation of the body: \(K^{\prime}=Io^{2}/2\), where \(I\)is the moment of inertia about the appropriate axis, which is the symmetry axis of the rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body, therefore, is given by

\[K=\frac{1}{2}Io^{2}+\frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^{2}\] (7.49a) Substituting \[I=mk^{2}\] where \[k=\] the corresponding radius of gyration of the body and \[v_{cm}=R\omega\], we get \[K=\frac{1}{2}\frac{mk^{2}v_{cm}^{2}}{R^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^{2}\] \[\text{or} K=\frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^{2}\left(1+\frac{k^{2}}{R^{2}}\right) \tag{7.49b}\]

Figure 37: The rolling motion (without slipping) of a disc \(\alpha\)a level surface. Note at any instant. the point of contact \(P_{0}\) of the disc with the surface is at rest: the centre of mass of the disc moves with velocity. The disc rotates with angular velocity about its axis which passes through C; \(v_{cm}=Ra\) where \(R\) is the radius of the disc.

15. Rotation about a fixed axis is directly analogous to linear motion in respect of kinematics and dynamics.
16. The angular acceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by \(I\alpha=r\). If the external torque \(\epsilon\) is zero, the component of angular momentum about the fixed axis \(I\omega\)of such a rotating body is constant.
17. For rolling motion without slipping \(v_{cm}=Ra\) where \(v_{cm}\) is the velocity of translation (i.e. of the centre of mass). \(R\) is the radius and \(m\) is the mass of the body. The kinetic energy of such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation:.

\(K=\frac{1}{2}m\;v_{cm}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}\).

POINTS TO PODER

1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external forces on the body.
2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass transnational motion of the system and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass \(K^{\prime}\) and the kinetic energy of the centre of mass \(MV^{2}/2\).

\(K=K^{\prime}+MV^{2}/2\)
3. Newton's Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in Newton's Second Law and also Newton's Third Law for particles.
4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton's second law for particles, but also Newton's third law with the provision that the forces between any two particle act along the line joining the particles.
5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total external force is zero but total torque is non-zero.
6. The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is zero.
7. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational field does not vary from one part of the body to the other.
8. The angular momentum \(\mathbf{L}\) and the angular velocity oare not necessarily parallel vectors. However, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation \(\mathbf{L}=I\omega\)holds good, where \(I\) is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.

## Chapter 8 Gravitation

### 8.1 Introduction

Early in our lives, we become aware of the tendency of all material objects to be attracted towards the earth. Anything thrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot more tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds above fall towards the earth and there are many other such phenomena. Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo (1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies, irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth with a constant acceleration. It is said that he made a public demonstration of this fact. To find the truth, he certainly did experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and arrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is close to the more accurate value obtained later.

A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars, planets and their motion has been the subject of attention in many countries since the earliest of times. Observations since early times recognised stars which appeared in the sky with positions unchanged year after year. The more interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular motions against the background of stars. The earliest recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy about 2000 years ago was a 'geocentric' model in which all celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved around the earth. The only motion that was thought to be possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle. Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy in order to describe the observed motion of the planets. The planets were described as moving in circles with the center of the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some 400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the Sun was the center around which the planets revolved - the 'heliocentric' model - was already mentioned by Aryabhatta (5\({}^{\rm th}\) century A.D.) in his treatise. A thousand years later, a Polish monk named NicolasCopernicus (1473-1543) proposed a definitive model in which the planets moved in circles around a fixed central sun. His theory was discredited by the church, but notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who had to face prosecution from the state for his beliefs.

It was around the same time as Galileo, a nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime recording observations of the planets with the naked eye. His compiled data were analysed later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571-1640). He could extract from the data three elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler's laws. These laws were known to Newton and enabled him to make a great scientific leap in proposing his universal law of gravitation.

### Kepler's Laws

The three laws of Kepler can be stated as follows:

**1. Law of orbits :** All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun situated at one of the foci of the ellipse (Fig. 8.1a). This law was a deviation from the Copernican model which allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of which the circle is a special case, is a closed curve which can be drawn very simply as follows.

Select two points F\({}_{1}\) and F\({}_{2}\). Take a length of a string and fix its ends at F\({}_{1}\) and F\({}_{2}\) by pins. With the tip of a pencil stretch the string taut and then draw a curve by moving the pencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig. 8.1b) The closed curve you get is called an ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from F\({}_{1}\) and F\({}_{2}\) is a constant. F\({}_{1}\), F\({}_{2}\) are called the foci. Join the points F\({}_{1}\) and F\({}_{2}\) and extend the line to intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown in Fig. 8.1b). The midpoint of the line PA is the centre of the ellipse O and the length PO = AO is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse. For a circle, the two foci merge into one and the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle.

**2. Law of areas :** The line that joins any planet to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time (Fig. 8.2). This law comes from the observations that planets appear to move slower when they are farther from the sun than when they are nearer.

## 3 Law of periods :

The square of the time period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced out by the planet.

The table below gives the approximate time periods of revolution of nine planets around the sun along with values of their semi-major axes.

Figure 8.1: An ellipse traced out by a planet around the sun. The closest point is P and the farthest point is A, P is called the perihelion and A the aphelion. The semimajor axis is half the distance AP.

Figure 8.2: The planet P moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area A\(A\) swept out in a small interval of time A.

## Central Forces

We know the time rate of change of the angular momentum of a single particle about the origin is

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}\]

The angular momentum of the particle is conserved, if the torque \(\mathbf{\dot{r}=r\times F}\) due to the force \(\mathbf{F}\) on it vanishes. This happens either when \(\mathbf{F}\) is zero or when \(\mathbf{F}\) is along \(\mathbf{r}\). We are interested in forces which satisfy the latter condition. Central forces satisfy this condition. A 'central' force is always directed towards or away from a fixed point, i.e., along the position vector of the point of application of the force with respect to the fixed point. (See Figure below.) Further, the magnitude of a central force \(F\) depends on \(\mathbf{r}\), the distance of the point of application of the force from the fixed point; \(F=F(\eta)\).

In the motion under a central force the angular momentum is always conserved. Two important results follow from this:

1. The motion of a particle under the central force is always confined to a plane.
2. The position vector of the particle with respect to the centre of the force [i.e. the fixed point] has a constant areal velocity. In other words the position vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the particle moves under the influence of the central force.

Try to prove both these results. You may need to know that the areal velocity is given by : \(\mathrm{d}A/\mathrm{d}t=\%\;r\sin\;\alpha\)

An immediate application of the above discussion can be made to the motion of a planet under the gravitational force of the sun. For convenience the sun may be taken to be so heavy that it is at rest. The gravitational force of the sun on the planet is directed towards the sun. This force also satisfies the requirement \(F=F(\eta)\), since \(F=G\;m_{1}m_{2}/r^{2}\) where \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) are respectively the masses of the planet and the sun and \(G\) is the universal constant of gravitation. The two results (1) and (2) described above, therefore, apply to the motion of the planet. In fact, the result (2) is the well-known second law of Kepler.

_Tr is the trajectory of the particle under the central force. At a position \(P\), the force is directed along \(\mathbf{OP}\), \(O\) is the centre of the force taken as the origin. In time \(\Delta t\), the particle moves from \(P\) to \(P^{\prime}\), at \(P^{\prime}=\Delta s=v\Delta t\). The tangent \(P\) at \(P\) to the trajectory gives the direction of the velocity at \(P\). The area swept in \(\Delta t\) is the area of sector \(\mathrm{POP^{\prime}}=\left(r\sin\alpha\right)\;P\mathrm{P^{\prime}}/2=\left( r\cos\alpha\right)\;\Delta t/2\).)_

_Answer_ (a) The angle between GC and the positive \(x\)-axis is \(30^{o}\) and so is the angle between GB and the negative \(x\)-axis. The individual forces in vector notation are

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{GA}}=\frac{Gm\left(2m\right)}{1}\mathbf{j}\\ \cdot\\ \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{GB}}=\frac{Gm\left(2m\right)}{1}\left(-\mathbf{i}\cos 30 ^{o}-\mathbf{j}\sin 30^{o}\right)\\ \cdot\\ \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{GC}}=\frac{Gm\left(2m\right)}{1}\left(+\mathbf{i}\cos 30 ^{o}-\mathbf{j}\sin 30^{o}\right)\\ \end{array}\]

From the principle of superposition and the law of vector addition, the resultant gravitational force \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{R}}\) on \(\left(2m\right)\) is

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{R}}=\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{GA}}+\mathbf{F}_ {\mathrm{GB}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{GC}}\\ \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{R}}=2Gm^{2}\mathbf{j}+2Gm^{2}\left(-\mathbf{i}\cos 30 ^{o}-\mathbf{j}\sin 30^{o}\right)\\ \end{array}\]

**Newton's Principia**

**Kepler had formulated his third law by 1619. The announcement of the underlying universal law of gravitation came about seventy years later with the publication in 1687 of Newton's masterpiece Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, often simply called the Principia.**

**Around 1685, Edmund Halley (after whom the famous Halley's comet is named), came to visit Newton at Cambridge and asked him about the nature of the trajectory of a body moving under the influence of an inverse square law. Without hesitation Newton replied that it had to be an ellipse, and further that he had worked it out long ago around 1665 when he was forced to retire to his farm house from Cambridge on account of a plague outbreak. Unfortunately, Newton had lost his papers. Halley prevailed upon Newton to produce his work in book form and agreed to bear the cost of publication. Newton accomplished this feat in eighteen months of superhuman effort. The Principia is a singular scientific masterpiece and in the words of Lagrange it is "the greatest production of the human mind." The Indian born astrophysicist and Nobel Laureate S. Chandrasekhar spent ten years writing a treatise on the Principia. His book, Newton's Principia for the Common Reader brings into sharp focus the beauty, clarity and breath taking economy of Newton's methods.**

Figure 8.5: Three equal masses are placed at the three vertices of the \(\Delta\) ABC. A mass 2m is placed at the centroid G.

The force of attraction due to a hollow spherical shell of uniform density, on a point mass situated inside it is zero. Qualitatively, we can again understand this result. Various regions of the spherical shell attract the point mass inside it in various directions. These forces cancel each other completely.

### The Gravitational Constant

The value of the gravitational constant G entering the Universal law of gravitation can be determined experimentally and this was first done by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. The apparatus used by him is schematically shown in figure.8.6

Schematic drawing of Cavendish's experimentS\({}_{i}\) and S\({}_{j}\) are large spheres which are kept on either side (shown shades) of the mass es at A and B. When the big spheres are taken to the other side of the masses (shown by dotted circles), the bar AB rotates a little since the torque reverses direction. The angle of rotation can be measured experimentally.

The bar AB has two small lead spheres attached at its ends. The bar is suspended from a rigid support by a fine wire. Two large lead spheres are brought close to the small ones but on opposite sides as shown. The big spheres attract the nearby small ones by equal and opposite force as shown. There is no net force on the bar but only a torque which is clearly equal to F times the length of the bar,where F is the force of attraction between a big sphere and its neighbouring small sphere. Due to this torque, the suspended wire gets twisted till such time as the restoring torque of the wire equals the gravitational torque. If \(\theta\) is the angle of twist of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is proportional to \(\theta\), equal to \(\tau\theta\). Where \(\tau\) is the restoring couple per unit angle of twist. \(\tau\) can be measured independently e.g. by applying a known torque and measuring the angle of twist. The gravitational force between the spherical balls is the same as if their masses are concentrated at their centers. Thus if d is the separation between the centers of the big and its neighbouring small ball, M and m their masses, the gravitational force between the big sphere and its neighbouring small ball is.

\[\cdot\quad F=G\,\frac{Mm}{d^{2}} \tag{8.6}\]

If L is the length of the bar AB, then the torque arising out of \(F\) is \(F\) multiplied by L. At equilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque and hence

\[\cdot\quad G\,\frac{Mm}{d^{2}}\,L=\tau\,\,\theta \tag{8.7}\]

Observation of \(\theta\) thus enables one to calculate G from this equation.

Since Cavendish's experiment, the measurement of G has been refined and the currently accepted value is

\[G=6.67\times 10^{-11}\,\,\,\,\,N\,\,\,m^{2}/kg^{2} \tag{8.8}\]

### Acceleration Due to Gravity of the Earth

The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made of a large number of concentric spherical shells with the smallest one at the centre and the largest one at its surface. A point outside the earth is obviously outside all the shells. Thus, all the shells exert a gravitational force at the point outside just as if their masses are concentrated at their common centre according to the result stated in the last section. The total mass of all the shells combined is just the mass of the earth. Hence, at a point outside the earth, the gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of the earth is concentrated at its center.

For a point inside the earth, the situation is different. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.7.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:190]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:191]

If we associate a potential energy \(W(h)\) at a point at a height \(h\) above the surface such that

\[W(h)=mgh\ +W_{{}_{0}} \tag{8.21}\]

(where \(W_{{}_{0}}\) = constant) :

then it is clear that

\[W_{{}_{12}}=W(h_{2})\ -W(h_{{}_{1}}) \tag{8.22}\]

The work done in moving the particle is just the difference of potential energy between its final and initial positions.Observe that the constant \(W_{{}_{0}}\) cancels out in Eq. (8.22). Setting \(h=0\) in the last equation, we get \(W(h=0)=W_{{}_{0}}\). \(h=0\) means points on the surface of the earth. Thus. \(W_{{}_{0}}\) is the potential energy on the surface of the earth.

If we consider points at arbitrary distance from the surface of the earth, the result just derived is not valid since the assumption that the gravitational force mg is a constant is no longer valid. However, from our discussion we know that a point outside the earth, the force of gravitation on a particle directed towards the center of the earth is

\[\dot{F}=\frac{GM_{{}_{E}}m}{r^{2}} \tag{8.23}\]

where \(M_{{}_{E}}\) = mass of earth, \(m\) = mass of the particle and \(r\) its distance from the center of the earth. If we now calculate the work done in lifting a particle from \(r=r_{{}_{1}}\) to \(r=r_{{}_{2}}\) (\(r_{{}_{2}}>r_{{}_{1}}\)) along a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (8.20)

\[W_{12}=\int_{{}_{0}}^{{}_{2}}\frac{G\ M\ m}{r^{2}}{\rm d}r\] \[\cdot\] \[= -G\ M_{{}_{E}}m\ \left(\frac{1}{r_{{}_{2}}}-\frac{1}{r_{{}_{1}}}\right) \tag{8.24}\]

In place of Eq. (8.21), we can thus associate a potential energy \(W(r)\) at a distance \(r\), such that \(\cdot\)

\[W(r)=-\frac{G\ M_{{}_{E}}m}{r}+W_{{}_{1}}\,. \tag{8.25}\]

valid for \(r>R\).

so that once again \(W_{{}_{12}}=W(r_{{}_{2}})-W(r_{{}_{1}})\). Setting \(r=\) infinity in the last equation. we get W (\(r=\) infinity ) = \(W_{{}_{1}}\). Thus. \(W_{{}_{1}}\) is the potential energy at infinity. One should note that only the difference of potential energy between two points has a definite meaning from Eqs. (8.22) and (8.24). One conventionally sets \(W_{{}_{1}}\) equal to zero. so that the potential energy at a point is just the amount of work done in displacing the particle from infinity to that point.

We have calculated the potential energy at a point of a particle due to gravitational forces on it due to the earth and it is proportional to the mass of the particle. The gravitational potential due to the gravitational force of the earth is defined as the potential energy of a particle of unit mass at that point. From the earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational potential energy associated with two particles of masses \(m_{{}_{1}}\) and \(m_{{}_{2}}\) separated by distance by a distance \(r\) is given by

\[V=-\frac{G\ m_{{}_{1}}m_{{}_{2}}}{r}\] (if we choose

\[V=0\]

 as

\[r\dot{-}\infty\]

)

It should be noted that an isolated system of particles will have the total potential energy that equals the sum of energies (given by the above equation) for all possible pairs of its constituent particles. This is an example of the application of the superposition principle.

Find the potential energy of a system of four particles placed at the vertices of a square of side \(l\). Also obtain the potential at the centre of the square.

Find the potential energy of a system of four particles placed at the vertices of a square of side \(l\). Also obtain the potential at the centre of the square.

Consider four masses each of mass m at the corners of a square of side \(l\): See Fig. 8.9. We have four mass pairs at distance \(l\) and two diagonal pairs at distance \(\sqrt{2}\ l\)

Hence.

\[W(r)=-4\ \frac{G\ m^{{}_{2}}}{l}-2\ \frac{G\ m^{{}_{2}}}{\sqrt{2}\ l}\]

Figure 8.9:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:195]

Considering gravitational potential energy at infinity to be zero, the potential energy at distance (R+h) from the center of the earth is.

\[P.E=-\frac{G\;m\;M_{E}}{\left[R_{E}+h\right]} \tag{8.41}\]

The K.E is positive whereas the P.E is negative. However, in magnitude the K.E. is half the P.E, so that the total E is

\[E=K.E+P.E=-\frac{G\;m\;M_{E}}{2(R_{E}+h)} \tag{8.42}\]

The total energy of an circularly orbiting satellite is thus negative, with the potential energy being negative but twice is magnitude of the positive kinetic energy.

When the orbit of a satellite becomes elliptic, both the K.E. and P.E. vary from point to point. The total energy which remains constantis negative as in the circular orbit case. This is what we expect, since as we have discussed before if the total energy is positive or zero, the object escapes to infinity. Satellites are always at finite distance from the earth and hence their energies cannot be positive or zero.

A 400 kg satellite is in a circular orbit of radius \(2R_{E}\) about the Earth. How much energy is required to transfer it to a circular orbit of radius \(4R_{E}\)? What are the changes in the kinetic and potential energies?

### India's Leap into Space

India entered the space age with the launching of the low orbit satellite Aryabhattain 1975. In the first fewyears of its programme the launch vehicles were provided by the erstwhile Soviet Union. Indigenous launch vehicles were employed in the early 1980's to send the Rohini series of satellites into space. The programme to send polar satellites into space began in late 1980's. A series of satellites labelled IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellites) have been launched and this programme is expected to continue in future. The satellites have been employed for surveying, weather prediction and for carrying out experiments in space. The INSAT (Indian National Satellite) series of satellites were designed and made operational for communications and weather prediction purposes beginning in 1982. European launch vehicles have been employed in the INSAT series. India tested its geostationary launch capability in 2001 when it sent an experimental communications satellite (GSAT-1) into space. In 1984 Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian astronaut. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the umbrella organisation that runs a number of centre. Its main launch centre at Sriharikota [SHAR] is 100 km north of Chennai. The National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) is near Hyderabad. Its national centre for research in space and allied sciences is the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) at Ahmedabad.

equatorial plane with \(T=24\) hours are called Geostationery Satellites. Clearly, since the earth rotates with the same period, the satellite would appear fixed from any point on earth. It takes very powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to such large heights above the earth but this has been done in view of the several benefits of many practical applications.

It is known that electromagnetic waves above a certain frequency are not reflected from ionosphere. Radio waves used for radio broadcast which are in the frequency range 2 MHz to 10 MHz, are below the critical frequency. They are therefore reflected by the ionosphere. Thus radio waves broadcast from an antenna can be received at points far away where the direct wave fail to reach on account of the curvature of the earth. Waves used in television broadcast or other forms of communication have much higher frequencies and thus cannot be received beyond the line of sight. A Geostationery satellite, appearing fixed above the broadcasting station can however receive these signals and broadcast them back to a wide area on earth. The INSAT group of satellites sent up by India are one such group of Geostationary satellites widely used for telecommunications in India.

Another class of satellites are called the Polar satellites (Fig. 11). These are low altitude (\(h\approx 500\) to \(800\) km) satellites, but they go around the poles of the earth in a north-south direction whereas the earth rotates around its axis in an east-west direction. Since its time period is around 100 minutes it crosses any altitude many times a day. However, since its height h above the earth is about 500-800 km, a camera fixed on it can view only small strips of the earth in one orbit. Adjacent strips are viewed in the next orbit, so that in effect the whole earth can be viewed strip by strip during the entire day. These satellites can view polar and equatorial regions at close distances with good resolution. Information gathered from such satellites is extremely useful for remote sensing, meterology as well as for environmental studies of the earth.

### Weightlessness

Weight of an object is the force with which the earth attracts it. We are conscious of our own weight when we stand on a surface, since the surface exerts a force opposite to our weight to keep us at rest. The same principle holds good when we measure the weight of an object by a spring balance hung from a fixed point e.g. the ceiling. The object would fall down unless it is subject to a force opposite to gravity. This is exactly what the spring exerts on the object. This is because the spring is pulled down a little by the gravitational pull of the object and in turn the spring exerts a force on the object vertically upwards.

Now, imagine that the top end of the balance is no longer held fixed to the top ceiling of the room. Both ends of the spring as well as the object move with identical acceleration \(g\). The spring is not stretched and does not exert any upward force on the object which is moving down with acceleration \(g\) due to gravity. The reading recorded in the spring balance is zero since the spring is not stretched at all. If the object were a human being, he or she will not feel his weight since there is no upward force on him. Thus, when an object is in free fall, it is weightless and this phenomenon is usually called the phenomenon of weightlessness.

In a satellite around the earth, every part and parcel of the satellite has an acceleration towards the center of the earth which is exactly

Figure 11: A Polar satellite. A strip on earth’s surface (shown shaded) is visible from the satellite during one cycle. For the next revolution of the satellite, the earth has rotated a little on its axis so that an adjacent strip becomes visible.

the value of earth's acceleration due to gravity at that position. Thus in the satellite everything inside it is in a state of free fall. This is just as if we were falling towards the earth from a height. Thus, in a manned satellite, people inside experience no gravity. Gravity for us defines the vertical direction and thus for them there are no horizontal or vertical directions, all directions are the same. Pictures of astronauts floating in a satellite reflect show this fact.

## Summary

1. Newton's law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between any two particles of masses \(m\), and \(m_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\) has the magnitude. \[F=G\,\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\] where \(G\) is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value \(6.672\times 10^{-11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{2}\).
2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle m due to a number of masses \(M_{r}\), \(M_{2}...M_{n}\)etc. we use the principle of superposition. Let \(F_{1}\), \(F_{2}...F_{n}\) be the individual forces due to \(M_{r}\), \(M_{2}...M_{n}\) each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition each force acts independently and uninfluenced by the other bodies. The resultant force \(F_{n}\) is then found by vector addition \[F_{n}\ =\ F_{1}+F_{2}+.....+F_{n}\ =\ \sum_{i-1}^{n}F_{i}\] where the symbol '\(\Sigma\) stands for summation.
3. Kepler's laws of planetary motion state that (a) All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points (b) The radius vector drawn from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is central and hence angular momentum is conserved. (c) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet The period \(T\) and radius \(R\) of the circular orbit of a planet about the Sun are related by \[T^{2}=\left(\frac{4\,\pi^{2}}{G\ M_{S}}\right)R^{3}\] where \(M_{n}\) is the mass of the Sun. Most planets have nearly circular orbits about the Sun. For elliptical orbits, the above equation is valid if \(R\) is replaced by the semi-major axis. \(a\).
4. The acceleration due to gravity. (a) at a height \(h\) above the Earth's surface. \[g(h)\ =\ \frac{G\ M_{E}}{\left(R_{E}\ +\ h\right)^{2}}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\ \frac{G\ M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\ \left(1\ -\ \frac{2h}{R_{E}}\right)\ \ \mbox{ for }h\!<R_{x}\] \[\cdot\] \[g(h)\ =\ g(0)\left(1\ -\ \frac{2h}{R_{E}}\right)\ \ \mbox{ where }g(0)\ =\ \frac{G\ M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\](b) at depth \(d\) below the Earth's surface is \(\cdot\) \(g(d)\ -\ \frac{G\ M_{\rm g}}{R_{\rm g}^{2}}\biggl{(}1\ -\ \frac{d}{R_{\rm g}}\biggr{)}\ -\ g(0)\ \biggl{(}1\ -\ \frac{d}{R_{\rm g}} \biggr{)}\)
5. The gravitational force is a conservative force, and therefore a potential energy function can be defined. The _gravitational potential energy_ associated with two particles separated by a distance \(r\) is given by \(\cdot\) \(V\) -- \(\frac{G\ m_{\rm g}\ m_{2}}{r}\) where \(V\) is taken to be zero at \(r\rightarrow\infty\). The total potential energy for a system of particles is the sum of energies for all pairs of particles, with each pair represented by a term of the form given by above equation. This prescription follows from the principle of superposition.
6. If an isolated system consists of a particle of mass \(m\) moving with a speed \(v\) in the vicinity of a massive body of mass \(M\), the total mechanical energy of the particle is given by \(E-\frac{1}{2}\ m\ v^{2}-\frac{G\ M\ m}{r}\) That is, the total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The total energy is a constant of motion.
7. If \(m\) moves in a circular orbit of radius \(a\) about \(M\), where \(M>>m\), the total energy of the system is \(\cdot\) \(E\) -- \(\frac{G\ M\ m}{2a}\) with the choice of the arbitrary constant in the potential energy given in the point 5., above. The total energy is negative for any bound system, that is, one in which the orbit is closed, such as an elliptical orbit. The kinetic and potential energies are \(\cdot\) \(K\) = \(\frac{G\ M\ m}{2a}\) \(V\) -- \(\frac{G\ M\ m}{a}\)
8. The escape speed from the surface of the Earth is \(\cdot\) \(v_{\rm e}=\sqrt{\frac{2\ G\ M_{\rm g}}{R_{\rm g}}}=\sqrt{2gR_{\rm g}}\) and has a value of 11.2 km s\({}^{-1}\).
9. If a particle is outside a uniform spherical shell or solid sphere with a spherically symmetric internal mass distribution, the sphere attracts the particle as though the mass of the sphere or shell were concentrated at the centre of the sphere.
10. If a particle is inside a uniform spherical shell, the gravitational force on the particle is zero. If a particle is inside a homogeneous solid sphere, the force on the particle acts toward the centre of the sphere. This force is exerted by the spherical mass interior to the particle.
11. A geostationary (geosynchronous communication) satellite moves in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane at a approximate distance of \(4.22\times 10^{4}\) km from the Earth's centre.

* POINTS TO PODER
* In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object the following quantities are conserved:
* Angular momentum
* Total mechanical energy
* Linear momentum is not conserved
* Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler's second law. However, it is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.
* In Kepler's third law (see Eq. (8.1) and \(T^{2}=K_{\rm s}R^{3}\), The constant \(K_{\rm s}\) is the same for all planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (8.38)].
* An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut and the satellite are in 'free fall' towards the Earth.
* The _gravitational potential energy_ associated with two particles separated by a distance \(r\) is given by \[V=-\frac{G\,m_{1}\,m_{2}}{r}+\mbox{constant}\] The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With this choice \[V=-\frac{G\,m_{1}\,m_{2}}{r}\] This choice implies that \(V\to 0\) as \(r\rightarrow\infty\). Choosing location of zero of the gravitational energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.
* The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always positive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential energy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.
* The commonly encountered expression \(mg\)\(h\) for the potential energy is actually an approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the point 6, above.
* Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.
* The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, unlike a metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. _Gravitational shielding is not possible._

Appendix A 7 General Guidelines for Using Symbols for Physical Quantities, Chemical Elements and Nuclides
* Symbols for physical quantities are normally single letters and printed in italic (or sloping) type. However, in case of the two letter symbols, appearing as a factor in a product, some spacing is necessary to separate this symbol from other symbols.
* Abbreviations, i.e.. shortened forms of names or expressions, such as p.e. for potential energy. are not used in physical equations. These abbreviations in the text are written in ordinary normal/roman (upright) type.
* Vectors are printed in bold and normal/roman (upright) type. However, in class room situations. vectors may be indicated by an arrow on the top of the symbol.
* Multiplication or product of two physical quantities is written with some spacing between them. Division of one physical quantity by another may be indicated with a horizontal bar or with solidus, a slash or a short oblique stroke mark (_/_) or by writing it as a product of the numerator and the inverse first power of the denominator, using brackets at appropriate places to clearly distinguish between the numerator and the denominator.
* Symbols for chemical elements are written in normal/roman (upright) type. The symbol is not followed by a full stop. For example, Ca, C, H, He, U, etc.
* The attached numerals specifying a nuclide are placed as a left subscript (atomic number) and superscript (mass number). For example, a U-235 nuclide is expressed as \(\mathbf{{}^{235}_{92}U}\) (with 235 expressing the mass number and 92 as the atomic number of uranium with chemical symbol U).
* The right superscript position is used, if required, for indicating a state of ionisation (in case of ions). For example, Ca\({}^{2+}\), PO\({}^{3-}_{4}\)

## Appendix A8 General Guidelines for using Symbols for Siunts, some other units, and superfixes

* Symbols for units of physical quantities are printed/written in Normal/Roman (upright) type.
* Standard and recommended symbols for units are written in lower case roman (upright) type, starting with small letters. The shorter designations for units such as kg, m, s, cd, etc., are symbols and not the abbreviations. The unit names are never capitalised. However, the unit symbols are capitalised only if the symbol for a unit is derived from a proper name of scientist, beginning with a capital, normal/roman letter. For example, m for the unit'metre', d for the unit 'day', atm for the unit 'atmospheric pressure', Hz for the unit 'hertz', Wb for the unit 'weber', J for the unit 'joule', A for the unit 'ampere', V for the unit 'volt', etc. The single exception is L, which is the symbol for the unit 'litre'. This exception is made to avoid confusion of the lower case letter l with the Arabic numeral l.
* Symbols for units do not contain any final full stop at the end of recommended letter and remain unaltered in the plural, using only singular form of the unit. For example, for a length of 25 centimetres the unit symbol is written as 25 cm and not 25 cms or 25 cm. or 25 cms., etc.
* Use of solidus ( /) is recommended only for indicating a division of one letter unit symbol by another unit symbol. Not more than one solidus is used. For example : m/s\({}^{2}\) or m s-2 (with a spacing between m and s-2) but not m/s/s: 1 Pl = 1 N s m\({}^{2}\) = 1 N s/m\({}^{2}\) = 1 kg/s m=1 kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-1}\), but not 1 kg/m/s:  J/K mol or J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\), but not J/K/mol: etc.
* Prefix symbols are printed in normal/roman (upright) type without spacing between the prefix symbol and the unit symbol. Thus certain approved prefixes written very close to the unit symbol are used to indicate decimal fractions or multiples of a SI unit, when it is inconveniently small or large. For example : megawatt ( 1 MW = 10\({}^{6}\) W); centimetre (1 cm = 10\({}^{-2}\) m); kilometre ( 1 km = 10\({}^{3}\) m); millivolt (1 mV= 10\({}^{-3}\) V);kilowatt-hour (1 kW h = 10\({}^{3}\) W h = 3.6 MJ = 3.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) J); microampere (1\(\mu\) A = 10\({}^{-6}\) A); micron (1\(\mu\)m = 10\({}^{-6}\) m); angstrom (1 A =0.1 nm = 10\({}^{-10}\) m); etc. The unit'micron' which equals 10\({}^{-6}\) m, i.e. a micrometre, is simply the name given to convenient sub-multiple of the metre. In the same spirit, the unit 'fermi', equal to a femtometre or 10\({}^{-15}\) m has been used as the convenient length unit in nuclear studies. Similarly, the unit 'bam', equal to 10\({}^{-28}\) m\({}^{2}\), is a convenient measure of cross-sectional areas in sub-atomic particle collisions. However, the unit'micron' is preferred over the unit'micrometre' to avoid confusion of the'micrometre' with the length measuring instrument called'micrometer'. These newly formed multiples or sub-multiples (cm, km, \(\mu\)m, \(\mu\)s, ns) of SI units, metre and second, constitute a new composite inseparable symbol for units.
* When a prefix is placed before the symbol of a unit. the combination of prefix and symbol is considered as a new symbol, for the unit, which can be raised to a positive or negative power without using brackets. These can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit. Rules for binding-in indices are not those of ordinary algebra. For example : cm\({}^{3}\) means always (cm)\({}^{3}\) = (0.01 m)\({}^{3}\) = (10\({}^{-2}\) m)\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{-6}\) m\({}^{3}\), but never 0.01 m\({}^{3}\) or 10\({}^{-2}\) m\({}^{3}\) or 1cm\({}^{3}\) (prefix c with a spacing with m\({}^{3}\) is meaningless as prefix c is to be attached to a unit symbol and it has no physical significance or independent existence without attachment with a unit symbol). Similarly. mA\({}^{2}\) means always (mA)\({}^{2}\)= (0.001A)\({}^{2}\) = (10\({}^{-3}\) A)\({}^{2}\) =10\({}^{-6}\) A\({}^{2}\), but never 0.001 A\({}^{2}\) or 10\({}^{-3}\) A\({}^{2}\) or m A\({}^{2}\); 1 cm\({}^{-1}\) = (10\({}^{-2}\)m)\({}^{-1}\)=10\({}^{2}\) m\({}^{-1}\), but not 1c m\({}^{-1}\) or 10\({}^{-2}\) m\({}^{-1}\); 1\(\mu\)s\({}^{-1}\) means always (10\({}^{-6}\)s)\({}^{-1}\)=10\({}^{6}\) s\({}^{-1}\), but not 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\) s\({}^{-1}\); 1 km\({}^{2}\) means always (km)\({}^{2}\) = (10\({}^{3}\) m)\({}^{2}\)=10\({}^{6}\) m\({}^{2}\), but not 10\({}^{3}\) m\({}^{2}\); 1mm\({}^{2}\) means always (mm)\({}^{2}\)= (10\({}^{-3}\) m)\({}^{2}\)=10\({}^{-6}\) m\({}^{2}\), but not 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{2}\).
* A prefix is never used alone. It is always attached to a unit symbol and written or fixed before (pre-fix) the unit symbol. For example : 10\({}^{3}\)/m\({}^{3}\) means 1000/m\({}^{3}\) or 1000 m\({}^{-3}\), but not k/m\({}^{3}\) or k m\({}^{-3}\). 10\({}^{6}\)/m\({}^{3}\) means 10.00.000/m\({}^{3}\) or 10.00.000 m\({}^{-3}\), but not M/m\({}^{3}\) or M m\({}^{-3}\)
* Prefix symbol is written very close to the unit symbol without spacing between them, while unit symbols are written separately with spacing when units are multiplied together. For example : m s\({}^{-1}\) (symbols m and s\({}^{-1}\), in lower case, small letter m and s, are separate and independent unit symbols for metre and second respectively, with spacing between them) means'metre per second', but not'milli per second'. Similarly. ms\({}^{-1}\) [symbol m and s are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol s, in lower case, small letter (for unit'second') without any spacing between them and making ms as a new composite unit] means 'per millisecond'. but never'metre per second'. \(\rm{mS}^{-1}\)[symbol m and S are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol S. in capital roman letter S (for unit'siemens') without any spacing between them, and making mS as a new composite unit] means 'per millisiemens', but never 'per millisecond'. \(\rm{C}\) m [symbol C and m are written separately, representing unit symbols C (for unit 'coulomb') and m (for unit'metre'), with spacing between them] means 'coulomb metre', but never 'centimetre', etc.
* The use of double prefixes is avoided when single prefixes are available. For example :\(10^{-9}\) m = 1 nm (nanometre), but not 1 mm (millil micrometre),

\(10^{-6}\) m = 1 \(\mu\)m (mi cron), but not 1 mmm(millil milli metre),

\(10^{-12}\) F = 1 pF (picofarad), but not 1\(\mu\)F (micromicofarad),

\(10^{9}\) W=1 GW (giga watt), but not 1 kMW (kilomegawatt), etc.
* The use of a combination of unit and the symbols for units is avoided when the physical quantity is expressed by combining two or more units. For example : joule per mole kelvin is written as J/mol K or J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\), but not joule/mole K or J/mol kelvin or J/mol K, etc. joule per tesla is written as J/T or J T\({}^{-1}\), but not joule /T or J per tesla or J/tesla, etc. newton metre second is written as N m s, but not Newton m second or N m second or N metre s or newton metre s, etc. joule per kilogram kelvin is written as J/kg K or J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\), but not J/kilog K or joule/kg K or J/kg kelvin or J/kilogram K, etc.
* To simplify calculations, the prefix symbol is attached to the unit symbol in the numerator and not to the denominator. For example : \(10^{6}\) N/m\({}^{2}\) is written more conveniently as MN/m\({}^{2}\), in preference to N/mm\({}^{2}\). A preference has been expressed for multiples or sub-multiples involving the factor 1000, \(10^{\pm 31}\) where n is the integer.
* Proper care is needed when same symbols are used for physical quantities and units of physical quantities. For example : The physical quantity weight (\(W\)) expressed as a product of mass (\(m\)) and acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) may be written in terms of symbols \(W\), \(m\) and \(g\) printed in italic ( or sloping) type as \(W\) = \(m\)\(g\), preferably with a spacing between \(m\) and \(g\). It should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units watt (W), metre (m) and gram (g). However, in the equation \(W\)=\(m\)\(g\), the symbol \(W\) expresses the weight with a unit symbol J, \(m\) as the mass with a unit symbol kg and \(g\) as the acceleration due to gravity with a unit symbol m/s\({}^{2}\). Similarly, in equation \(F\)=\(m\)\(a\), the symbol \(F\) expresses the force with a unit symbol N, \(m\) as the mass with a unit symbol kg, and \(a\) as the acceleration with a unit symbol m/s\({}^{2}\). These symbols for physical quantities should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units 'faroal' [F],'metre'[m] and 'are' [a]. Proper distinction must be made while using the symbols h (prefix hecto, and unit hour), c (prefix centi, and unit carat), d (prefix deci and unit day), T(prefix tera, and unit tesla), a (prefix atto, and unit are), da (prefix deca, and unit declare), etc.
* SI base unit'kilogram' for mass is formed by attaching SI prefix (a multiple equal to \(10^{3}\)) 'kilo' to a cgs (centimetre, gram, second) unit 'gram' and this may seem to result in an anomaly. Thus, while a thousandth part of unit of length (metre) is called a millimetre (mm), a thousandth part of the unit of mass [kg] is not called a milliklogram, but just a gram. This appears to give the impression that the unit of mass is a gram (g) which is not true. Such a situation has arisen because we are unable to replace the name 'kilogram' by any other suit table unit. Therefore, as an exception, name of the multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching prefixes to the word 'gram' and not to the word 'kilogram'. For example : \(10^{3}\) kg = 1 megagram ( 1Mg), but not 1 kilo kilogram (1 kkg); \(10^{-6}\) kg = 1 milligram ( 1 mg), but not 1 microkilogram ( 1\(\mu\)kg; \(10^{-3}\) kg = 1 gram (1g), but not 1 milliklogram (1 mkg), etc.

It may be emphasised again that you should use the internationally approved and recommended symbols only. Continual practice of following general rules and guidelines in unit symbol writing would make you learn mastering the correct use of SI units, prefixes and related symbols for physical quantities in a proper perspective.

* 5.22 Alternative (b) is correct, according to the First Law
* 5.23 (a) The horse-cart system has no external force in empty space. The mutual forces between the horse and the cart cancel (Third Law). On the ground, the contact force between the system and the ground (friction) causes their motion from rest. (b) Due to inertia of the body not directly in contact with the seat. (c) A lawn mower is pulled or pushed by applying force at an angle. When you push, the normal force (\(N\)) must be more than its weight, for equilibrium in the vertical direction. This results in greater friction\(f(f\approx N)\) and, therefore, a greater applied force to move. Just the opposite happens while pulling, (d) To reduce the rate of change of momentum and hence to reduce the force necessary to stop the ball.
* 5.24 A body with a constant speed of 1 cm s\({}^{-1}\) receives impulse of magnitude 0.04 kg \(\times\) 0.02 m s\({}^{-1}\) = 8 x 10\({}^{-4}\) kg m s\({}^{-1}\) after every 2 s from the walls at \(x\) = 0 and \(x\) = 2 cm.

* 5.26 Alternative (a) is correct. Note \(mg+T_{2}=m\omega_{2}^{2}/R\) ; \(T_{1}-mg\) = \(m\omega_{1}^{2}/R\) The moral is : do not confuse the actual material forces on a body (tension, gravitational force, etc) with the effects they produce : centripetal acceleration \(\omega_{2}^{2}/R\) or \(\omega_{1}^{2}/R\) in this example.
* 5.27 (a) 'Free body' : crew and passengers Force on the system by the floor = \(F\) upwards; weight of system = mg downwards; \(\therefore\). \(F-mg\) = \(ma\) F = 7.5 x 10\({}^{3}\) N upward By the Third Law, force on the floor by the crew and passengers = 7.5 x 10\({}^{3}\) N downwards. (b) 'Free body' : helicopter plus the crew and passengers Force by air on the system = R upwards; weight of system = mg downwards \(\therefore\). \(R-mg\) = \(ma\) \(R-1300\times 10\) = 1300 x 15 \(R\) = 3.25 x 10\({}^{4}\) N upwards By the Third Law, force [action] on the air by the helicopter = 3.25 x 10\({}^{4}\) N downwards.

* 5.31 The centripetal force is provided by the lateral thrust by the rail on the flanges of the wheels. By the Third Law, the train exerts an equal and opposite thrust on the rail causing its wear and tear. \[\text{Angle~{}~{}of~{}banking}=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{R~{}g}\right)=\tan^ {-1}\left(\frac{15\times 15}{30\times 10}\right)\square~{}37^{o}\]
* 5.32 Consider the forces on the man in equilibrium : his weight, force due to the rope and normal force due to the floor.

* 5.35 \(T=400\) N
* 5.36 The rope will break in case (a).
* 5.37 We assume perfect contact between bodies A and B and the rigid partition. In that case, the self-adjusting normal force on B by the partition (reaction) equals 200 N. There is no impending motion and no friction. The action-reaction forces between A and B are also 200 N. When the partition is removed, kinetic friction comes into play. Acceleration of A + B = [ 200 - ( 150 \(\times\) 0.15 ) ] / 15 =11.8 m s\({}^{2}\) Friction on A = 0.15 \(\times\) 50 = 7.5 N
* 200 - 7.5 - F\({}_{\text{AB}}\) = 5 \(\times\) 11.8
* \(F_{\text{AB}}\) = 1.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{2}\) N; opposite to motion.
* \(F_{\text{BA}}\) = 1.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{2}\) N; in the direction of motion.
* 5.35 (a) Maximum frictional force possible for opposing impending relative motion between the block and the trdley = 150 \(\times\) 0.18 = 27 N, which is more than the frictional force of 15 \(\times\) 0.5 = 7.5 N needed to accelerate the box with the traley. When the traley moves with uniform velocity, there is no force of friction acting on the block. (b) For the accelerated (non-inertial) observer, frictional force is opposed by the pseudo-force of the same magnitude, keeping the box at rest relative to the observer. When the trdley moves with uniform velocity there is no pseudo-force for the moving (inertial) observer and no friction.
* 5.36 Acceleration of the box due to friction = \(\mu g=0.15\times 10=1.5\) m s\({}^{2}\). But the acceleration of the truck is greater. The acceleration of the box relative to the truck is 0.5 m s\({}^{2}\) towards the rear end. The time taken for the box to fall off the truck = \(\sqrt{\frac{2~{}5}{0.5}}\)\(\sqrt{20}~{}\mathbf{s}\cdot\) During this time, the truck covers a distance = \(\sqrt{\frac{2~{}5}{0.5}}\)\(\sqrt{20}~{}\mathbf{s}\cdot\)
For the coin to revolve with the disc, the force of friction should be enough to provide the necessary centrpetal force, i.e \(\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\leq\mu\ m\ g\). Now \(v=r\omega\), where \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\)is the angular frequency of the disc. For a given \(\mu\) and \(\omega\), the condition is \(r\leq\mu g\ /\ \omega^{2}\). The condition is satisfied by the nearer coin ( 4 cm from the centre).
* At the uppermost point, \(N+mg=\frac{mv^{2}}{R}\), where \(N\) is the normal force (downwards) on the motorcyclist by the ceiling of the chamber. The minimum possible speed at the uppermost point corresponds to \(N=0\). i.e. \(v_{\rm mm}\ \sqrt{R\ g}\ \ \sqrt{25\ 10}\ \ \ 16\,\mbox{m}\,\mbox{s}^{-1}\)
* The horizontal force \(N\) by the wall on the man provides the needed centrpetal force : \(N\) = \(m\,R\ \omega^{2}\). The frictional force \(f\) (vertically upwards) opposes the weight \(mg\). The man remains stuck to the wall after the floor is removed if \(mg=f<\mu\ N\)i.e. \(mg<\mu\ m\,R\ \omega^{2}\). The minimum angular speed of rotation of the cylinder is \(\omega_{min}=\sqrt{g/\mu\ R}\ \ =\ 5\ \mbox{s}^{-1}\)
* Consider the free-body diagram of the bead when the radius vector joining the centre of the wire makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical downward direction. We have \(mg=N\cos\theta\) and \(m\,R\sin\theta\ \omega^{2}=N\sin\theta\). These equations give \(\cos\ \theta=g/R\omega^{2}\). Since \(\cos\ \theta\leq 1\), the bead remains at its lowermost point for \(\omega\ \leq\sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}\). For \(\omega\)=\(\sqrt{\frac{2g}{R}}\), \(\cos\ \theta=\frac{1}{2}\) i.e. \(\theta=60^{0}\).

* 7.29 (a) Frictional force at B  opposes velocity of B. Therefore, frictional force is in the same direction as the arrow. The sense of frictional torque is such as to oppose angular motion. \(\omega_{{}_{o}}\) and \(\tau\) are both normal to the paper, the first into the paper, and the second coming out of the paper. (b) Frictional force decreases the velocity of the point of contact B. Perfect rolling ensues when this velocity is zero. Once this is so, the force of friction is zero.

## Chapter 17 Mechanical Properties of Fluids

### 17.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we shall study some common physical properties of liquids and gases. Liquids and gases can flow and are therefore, called fluids. It is this property that distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.

Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water. Water is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian body constitute mostly of water. All the processes occurring in living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus understanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is important.

How are fluids different from solids? What is common in liquids and gases? Unlike a solid, a fluid has no definite shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small. In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases.

Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress of fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.

### 17.2 Pressure

A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our skin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a wider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against it with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man's chest. his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whosechest a large, light but strong wooden plank is placed first, is saved from this accident. Such everyday experiences convince us that both the force and its coverage area are important. Smaller the area on which the force acts, greater is the impact. This concept is known as pressure.

When an object is submerged in a fluid at rest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This force is always normal to the object's surface. This is so because if there were a component of force parallel to the surface, the object will also exert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a consequence of Newton's third law. This force will cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface. Since the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen. Hence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has to be perpendicular to the surface in contact with it. This is shown in Fig.10.1(a).

The normal force exerted by the fluid at a point may be measured. An idealised form of one such pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. 10.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with a spring that is calibrated to measure the force acting on the piston. This device is placed at a point inside the fluid. The inward force exerted by the fluid on the piston is balanced by the outward spring force and is thereby measured.

If \(F\) is the magnitude of this normal force on the piston of area \(A\) then the **average pressure**\(P_{av}\) is defined as the normal force acting per unit area.

\[P_{av}=\frac{F}{A} \tag{10.1}\]

In principle, the piston area can be made arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined in a limiting sense as

\[P=\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{\Delta A\to 0}\frac{F}{A} \tag{10.2}\]

Pressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the reader that it is the component of the force normal to the area under consideration and not the [vector] force that appears in the numerator in Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are [ML-T\({}^{2}\)]. The SI unit of pressure is N m\({}^{2}\). It has been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the French scientist Blaise Pascal [1623-1662] who carried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere [atm]. i.e. the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level [1 atm = 1.013 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\)Pa].

Another quantity, that is indispensable in describing fluids, is the density \(\rho\). For a fluid of mass \(m\) occupying volume \(V\).

\[\rho=\frac{m}{V} \tag{10.3}\]

The dimensions of density are [ML-\({}^{3}\)]. Its SI unit is kg m\({}^{3}\). It is a positive scalar quantity. A liquid is largely incompressible and its density is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures. Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure.

The density of water at 4\({}^{0}\)C (277 K) is 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{-3}\). The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water at 4\({}^{0}\)C. It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity. For example the relative density of aluminum is 2.7. Its density is 2.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{-3}\). The densities of some common fluids are displayed in Table 10.1.

\begin{table}

_Answer_ **Total cross-sectional area of the femurs is \(A=2\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) = 20 \(\times\) 10\({}^{4}\) m\({}^{2}\). The force acting on them is \(F=40\) kg wt = 400 N (taking \(g=10\) m s-2). This force is acting vertically down and hence, normally on the femurs. Thus, the average pressure is

* _P\({}_{\rm av}-\frac{F}{A}-2\times 10^{5}\) N m-2_

#### 10.2.1 Pascal's Law

The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all points if they are at the same height. This fact may be demonstrated in a simple way.

* _Proof of Pascal's law. ABC-DEF is an element of the interior of a fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this prismatic element is very small so that part of it can be considered at the same depth from the liquid surface and therefore. the effect of the gravity is the same at all these points. But for clarity we have enlarged this element. The forces on this element are those exerted by the rest of the fluid and they must be normal to the surfaces of the element as discussed above. Thus, the fluid exerts pressures \(P_{\rm a}\), \(P_{\rm b}\) and \(P_{\rm c}\) on this element of area corresponding to the normal forces \(F_{\rm a}\), \(F_{\rm b}\) and \(F_{\rm c}\) as shown in Fig. 10.2.2 on the faces BEFC. ADFC and ADEB denoted by \(A_{\rm a}\). \(A_{\rm b}\) and \(A_{\rm c}\) respectively. Then
* \(F_{\rm b}\sin\theta=F_{\rm c}\). \(F_{\rm b}\cos\theta=F_{\rm a}\) (by equilibrium) \(A_{\rm b}\sin\theta=A_{\rm c}\). \(A_{\rm b}\cos\theta=A_{\rm a}\) (by geometry)
* _Proof of Pascal's law. ABC-DEF is an element of the interior of a fluid at rest. This element is in the form of a right-angled prism. The element is small so that the effect of gravity can be ignored, but it has been enlarged for the sake of clarity._

Fig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of a fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this prismatic element is very small so that part of it can be considered at the same depth from the liquid surface and therefore. the effect of the gravity is the same at all these points. But for clarity we have enlarged this element. The forces on this element are those exerted by the rest of the fluid and they must be normal to the surfaces of the element as discussed above. Thus, the fluid exerts pressures \(P_{\rm a}\), \(P_{\rm b}\) and \(P_{\rm c}\) on this element of area corresponding to the normal forces \(F_{\rm a}\), \(F_{\rm b}\) and \(F_{\rm c}\) as shown in Fig. 10.2.2 on the faces BEFC. ADFC and ADEB denoted by \(A_{\rm a}\). \(A_{\rm b}\) and \(A_{\rm c}\) respectively. Then

* \(F_{\rm b}\sin\theta=F_{\rm c}\). \(F_{\rm b}\cos\theta=F_{\rm a}\) (by equilibrium) \(A_{\rm b}\sin\theta=A_{\rm c}\). \(A_{\rm b}\cos\theta=A_{\rm a}\) (by geometry)
* _Proof of Pascal's law. ABC-DEF is an element of the interior of a fluid at rest. This element is in the form of a right-angled prism. The element is small so that the effect of gravity can be ignored, but it has been enlarged for the sake of clarity._

Fig. 10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth

Consider a fluid at rest in a container. In Fig. 10.3 point 1 is at height \(h\) above a point 2. The pressures at points 1 and 2 are \(P_{\rm i}\) and \(P_{\rm 2}\) respectively. Consider a cylindrical element of fluid having area of base \(A\) and height \(h\). As the fluid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces should be zero and the resultant vertical forces should balance the weight of the element. The forces acting in the vertical direction are due to the fluid pressure at the top (\(P_{\rm i}A\)) acting downward, at the bottom (\(P_{\rm 2}A\)) acting upward. If \(mg\) is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we have

* \((P_{\rm 2}-P_{\rm i})\)\(A=mg\)

Now, if \(\rho\) is the mass density of the fluid, we have the mass of fluid to be \(m=\rho V=\rho hA\) so that

* \(P_{\rm 2}-P_{\rm i}=\rho gh\)
Pressure difference depends on the vertical distance \(h\) between the points (1 and 2), mass density of the fluid \(\rho\) and acceleration due to gravity \(g\). If the point 1 under discussion is shifted to the top of the fluid (say water), which is open to the atmosphere. P\({}_{1}\) may be replaced by atmospheric pressure (P\({}_{a}\)) and we replace P\({}_{2}\) by P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives

\[P=P_{a}+\rho gh \tag{10.7}\]

Thus, the pressure \(P\), at depth below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount \(\rho gh\). The excess of pressure, \(P-P_{a}\), at depth \(h\) is called a **gauge pressure** at that point.

The area of the cylinder is not appearing in the expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7). Thus, the height of the fluid column is important and not cross sectional or base area or the shape of the container. The liquid pressure is the same at all points at the same horizontal level (same depth). The result is appreciated through the example of **hydrostatic paradox**. Consider three vessels A, B and C [Fig.10.4] of different shapes. They are connected at the bottom by a horizontal pipe. On filling with water the level in the three vessels is the same though they hold different amounts of water. This is so, because water at the bottom has the same pressure below each section of the vessel.

_Example 10.2_.: What is the pressure on a swimmer 10 m below the surface of a lake?

_Answer_ Here

\(h\) = 10 m _and_\(\rho\) = 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\). Take g = 10 m s\({}^{2}\)

From Eq. (10.7)

\(P\) = P\({}_{a}+\rho gh\)

= 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) Pa + 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\)\(\times\) 10 m s\({}^{2}\)\(\times\) 10 m

= 2.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa

= 2 atm

This is a 100% increase in pressure from surface level. At a depth of 1 km the increase in pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed to withstand such enormous pressures.

#### Atmospheric Pressure and Gauge Pressure

The pressure of the atmosphere at any point is equal to the weight of a column of air of unit cross sectional area extending from that point to the top of the atmosphere. At sea level it is 1.013 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) devised for the first time, a method for measuring atmospheric pressure. Along glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury is inverted into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig, 10.5 (a). This device is known as mercury barometer. The space above the mercury column in the tube contains only mercury vapour whose pressure \(P\) is so small that it may be neglected. The pressure inside the column at point A must equal the pressure at point B, which is at the same level. Pressure at B = atmospheric pressure = \(P_{a}\)

\(P_{a}=\rho gh\)

where \(\rho\) is the density of mercury and \(h\) is the height of the mercury column in the tube.

Figure 10.4: Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The three vessels A, B and C contain different amounts of liquids, all up to the same height.

Figure 10.3: Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is illus treated through pess ure on a vertical cylindrical column.

In the experiment it is found that the mercury column in the barometer has a height of about 76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere (1 atm). This can also be obtained using the value of \(\rho\) in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating pressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury (Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a torr (after Torricelli).

1 torr = 133 Pa.

The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit is the bar and millibar.

1 bar = 10\({}^{\circ}\) Pa

An open-tubemanometer is a useful instrument for measuring pressure differences. It consists of a U-tube containing a suitable liquid i.e. a low density liquid (such as dl) for measuring small pressure differences and a high density liquid (such as mercury) for large pressure differences. One end of the tube is open to the atmosphere and other end is connected to the system whose pressure we want to measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure \(P\) at A is equal to pressure at point B. What we normally measure is the gauge pressure, which is \(P\)-\(P_{\rm a}\), given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional to manometer height \(h\).

_Fig 10.5 (a) The mercury barometer._

_Fig 10.5 Two pressure measuring devices._

**Pressure is same at the same level on both sides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For liquids the density varies very little over wide ranges in pressure and temperature and we can treat it safely as a constant for our present purposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits large variations of densities with changes in pressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids are therefore, largely treated as incompressible.**

_Example 10.3 The density of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m\({}^{3}\). Assume that it does not change with altitude. Then how high would the atmosphere extend?_

_Answer_ **We use Eq. (10.7)**

\(\rho gh=1.29\) kg m\({}^{3}\times\) 9.8 ms\({}^{2}\times\)\(h\) m = 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa

:_h_ = 7989 m = 8 km

In reality the density of air decreases with height. So does the value of \(g\). The atmospheric cover extends with decreasing pressure over 100 km. We should also note that the sea level atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a sign of an approaching storm. \(\dagger\)

#### 10.2.4 Hydraulic Machines

Let us now consider what happens when we change the pressure on a fluid contained in a vessel. Consider a horizontal cylinder with a piston and three vertical tubes at different points. The pressure in the horizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid column in the vertical tubes.It is necessarily the same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level in each one of them.

This indicates that when the pressure on the cylinder was increased, it was distributed uniformly throughout. We can say **whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a fluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions. This is the Pascal's law for transmission of fluid pressure and has many applications in daily life**.

A number of devices such as **hydraulic lift** and **hydraulic brakes** are based on the Pascal's law. In these devices fluids are used for transmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift as shown in Fig. 10.6 two pistons are separated by the space filled with a liquid. A piston of small cross section \(A_{1}\) is used to exert a force \(F_{1}\) directly on the liquid. The pressure \(P=\frac{\cdot}{A_{1}}\) is transmitted throughout the liquid to the larger cylinder attached with a larger piston of area \(A_{2}\), which results in an upward force of \(P\times A_{2}\). Therefore, the piston is capable of supporting a large force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck, placed on the platform) \(F_{2}=P_{A_{2}}=\frac{\cdot}{A_{1}}\). By changing the force at \(A_{1}\), the platform can be 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:237]

force on the pedal with our foot the master piston moves inside the master cylinder, and the pressure caused is transmitted through the brake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large force acts on the piston and is pushed down expanding the brake shoes against brake lining. In this way a small force on the pedal produces a large retarding force on the wheel. An important advantage of the system is that the pressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted equally to all cylinders attached to the four wheels so that the braking effort is equal on all wheels.

### Streamline flow

**So far we have studied fluids at rest.** The study of the fluids in motion is known as fluid dynamics. When a water-tap is turned on slowly, the water flow is smooth initially, but loses its smoothness when the speed of the outflow is increased. In studying the motion of fluids we focus our attention on what is happening to various fluid particles at a particular point in space at a particular time. The flow of the fluid is said to be **steady** if at any given point, the velocity of each passing fluid particle remains constant in time. This does not mean that the velocity at different points in space is same. The velocity of a particular particle may change as it moves from one point to another. Thatis, at some other point the particle may have a different velocity, but every other particle which passes the second point behaves exactly as the previous particle that has just passed that point. Each particle follows a smooth path, and the paths of the particles do not cross each other.

The path taken by a fluid particle under a steady flow is a **streamline**. It is defined as a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the fluid velocity at that point. Consider the path of a particle as shown in Fig 10.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid particle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a permanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the fluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for if they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go either one way or the other and the flow would not be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of flow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely spaced streamlines? If we intend to show streamline of every flowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g., at three points P, R and Q in Fig.10.7 (b). The plane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be determined by the same set of streamlines. This means that number of fluid particles crossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the same. If area of cross-sections at these points are \(A_{p}\),\(A_{n}\) and \(A_{0}\) and speeds of fluid particles are \(v_{p}\), \(v_{n}\) and \(v_{0}\). Then mass of fluid \(\dot{A}m_{b}\) crossing at \(A_{p}\) in a small interval of time \(\dot{A}t\) is \(\rho_{p}A_{p}v_{n}\dot{A}t\). Similarly mass of fluid \(\dot{A}m_{b}\) flowing or crossing at \(A_{n}\) in a small interval of time \(\dot{A}t\) is \(\rho_{p}A_{n}v_{n}\dot{A}t\) and mass of fluid \(\dot{A}m_{b}\) is \(\rho_{p}A_{n}v_{n}\dot{A}t\) crossing at \(A_{0}\). The mass of liquid flowing out equals the mass flowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore,

\[\rho_{p}A_{p}v_{p}\dot{A}t=\rho_{R}A_{n}v_{R}\dot{A}t=\rho_{q}A_{0}v_{q}\dot{A}t \tag{10.9}\]

For flow of incompressible fluids

\[\rho_{p}=\rho_{k}=\rho_{q}\]

Equation (10.9) reduces to

\[A_{p}v_{p}=A_{n}v_{R}=A_{0}v_{0} \tag{10.10}\]

which is called the **equation of continuity** and it is a statement of conservation of mass in flow of incompressible fluids. In general

\[Av=\text{constant} \tag{10.11}\]

\(Av\) gives the volume flux or flow rate and remains constant throughout the pipe of flow. Thus, at narrower portions where the streamlines are closely spaced, velocity increases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it is clear that \(A_{n}>A_{0}\) or \(v_{R}<v_{0}\), the fluid is accelerated while passing from R to Q. This is associated with a change in pressure in fluid flow in horizontal pipes.

Steady flow is achieved at low flow speeds. Beyond a limiting value, called critical speed, this flow loses steadiness and becomes **turbulent**. One sees this when a fast flowing

stream encounters rocks, small foamy whirlpool-like regions called 'white water rapids are formed.

Figure 10.8 displays streamlines for some typical flows. For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes a laminar flow where the velocities at different points in the fluid may have different magnitudes but their directions are parallel. Figure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent flow.

### Bernoulli's principle

Fluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we can obtain some useful properties for steady or streamline flows using the conservation of energy.

Consider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying heights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose that an incompressible fluid is flowing through the pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must change as a consequence of equation of continuity. A force is required to produce this acceleration, which is caused by the fluid surrounding it, the pressure must be different in different regions. Bernoulli's equation is a general expression that relates the pressure difference between two points in a pipe to both velocity changes (kinetic energy change) and elevation (height) changes (potential energy change). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli developed this relationship in 1738.

Consider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e. BC) and 2 (i.e. DE). Consider the fluid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal time interval \(\Delta t\), this fluid would have moved. Suppose \(v_{{}_{1}}\) is the speed at B and \(v_{{}_{2}}\) at D. then fluid initially at B has moved a distance \(v_{{}_{1}}\Delta t\) to C (\(v_{{}_{1}}\Delta t\) is small enough to assume constant cross-section along BC). In the same interval \(\Delta t\) the fluid initially at D moves to E. a distance equal to \(v_{{}_{2}}\Delta t\). Pressures \(P_{{}_{1}}\) and \(P_{{}_{2}}\) act as shown on the plane faces of areas \(A_{{}_{1}}\) and \(A_{{}_{2}}\) binding the two regions. The work done on the fluid at left end (BC) is \(W_{{}_{1}}=P_{{}_{1}}A_{{}_{1}}\{v_{{}_{1}}\Delta t\}=P_{{}_{1}}\Delta V\). Since the same volume \(\Delta V\) passes through both the regions (from the equation of continuity) the work done by the fluid at the other end (DE) is \(W_{{}_{2}}=P_{{}_{2}}A_{{}_{2}}\{v_{{}_{2}}\Delta t\}=P_{{}_{2}}\Delta V\) or. the work done on the fluid is \(-P_{{}_{2}}\Delta V\). So the total work done on the fluid is

\(W_{{}_{1}}-W_{{}_{2}}=(P_{{}_{1}}-P_{{}_{2}})\Delta V\)

Part of this work goes into changing the kinetic energy of the fluid. and part goes into changing the gravitational potential energy. If the density of the fluid is \(\rho\) and \(\Delta m=\rho A_{{}_{1}}v_{{}_{1}}\Delta t=\rho\Delta V\) is the mass passing through the pipe in time \(\Delta t\), then change in gravitational potential energy is

\(\Delta U=\rho g\Delta V\) (\(h_{{}_{2}}-h_{{}_{1}}\))

The change in its kinetic energy is

\(\Delta K=\dot{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\rho\Delta V\) (\(v_{{}_{2}}^{2}-v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\))

We can employ the work - energy theorem (Chapter 6) to this volume of the fluid and this yields

\((P_{{}_{1}}-P_{{}_{2}})\Delta V=\dot{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\rho\Delta V(v_ {{}_{2}}^{2}-v_{{}_{1}}^{2})+\rho g\Delta V\) (\(h_{{}_{2}}-h_{{}_{1}}\))

We now divide each term by \(\Delta V\) to obtain

\((P_{{}_{1}}-P_{{}_{2}})=\dot{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\rho\left(v_{{}_{2}}^{2 }-v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\right)+\rho g\left(h_{{}_{2}}-h_{{}_{1}}\right)\)

Figure 10.8: (a) Some streamlines for fluid flow. (b) A Jet of air striking a flat plate placed perpendicular to it. This is an example of turbulent flow.

We can rearrange the above terms to obtain

\[P_{1}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\rho v_{1}{}^{2}+\rho gh_{1}=P_{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2 }\right)\rho v_{2}{}^{2}+\rho gh_{2} \tag{10.12}\]

This is **Bernoulli's equation**. Since 1 and 2 refer to any two locations along the pipeline, we may write the expression in general as

\[P+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\rho v^{2}+\rho gh=\mathrm{constant} \tag{10.13}\]

In words, the Bernoulli's relation may be stated as follows: As we move along a streamline the sum of the pressure (\(P\)), the kinetic energy per unit volume \(\frac{v^{2}}{2}\) and the potential energy per unit volume (\(\rho gh\)) remains a constant.

Note that in applying the energy conservation principle, there is an assumption that no energy is lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids flow, some energy does get lost due to internal friction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid flow, the different layers of the fluid flow with different velocities. These layers exert frictional forces on each other resulting in a loss of energy. This property of the fluid is called viscosity and is discussed in more detail in a later section. The lost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into heat energy. Thus, Bernoulli's equation ideally applies to fluids with zero viscosity or non-viscous fluids. Another restriction on application of Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be incompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken into consideration. In practice, it has a large number of useful applications and can help explain a wide variety of phenomena for low viscosity incompressible fluids. Bernoulli's equation also does not hold for non-steady or turbulent flows, because in that situation velocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating in time.

When a fluid is at rest i.e. its velocity is zero everywhere, Bernoulli's equation becomes

\[P_{1}+\rho gh_{1}=P_{2}+\rho gh_{2}\] \[(P_{1}-P_{2})=\rho g\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right)\]

which is same as Eq. (10.6).

#### Speed of Efflux: Torricelli's Law

The word efflux means fluid outflow. Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body. Consider a tank containing a liquid of density \(\rho\) with a small hole in its side at a height \(y_{{}_{I}}\) from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10). The air above the liquid, whose surface is at height \(y_{{}_{2}}\), is at pressure \(P\). From the equation of continuity [Eq. (10.10)] we have

\[\begin{array}{l}v_{{}_{I}}A_{{}_{I}}=v_{{}_{2}}A_{{}_{2}}\\ v_{{}_{2}}=\frac{A_{{}_{I}}}{A_{{}_{2}}}v_{{}_{1}}\end{array}\]

Figure 10.10: Torricelli’s law. The speed of efflux. \(v_{{}_{I}}\) from the side of the container is given by the application of Bernoulli’s equation. If the container is open at the top to the atmosphere then \(v_{{}_{I}}\), \(\frac{\rho gh}{\rho gh}\).

Figure 9.9: The flow of an ideal fluid in a pipe of varying cross section. The fluid in a section of length \(v_{{}_{I}}\)At moves to the section of length \(v_{{}_{I}}\)At in time \(\Delta t\).

If the cross sectional area of the tank \(A_{{}_{2}}\) is much larger than that of the hole (\(A_{{}_{2}}>\)\(>\)\(A_{{}_{1}}\)), then we may take the fluid to be approximately at rest at the top, i.e. \(v_{{}_{2}}=0\). Now applying the Bernoulli equation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at the hole \(P_{{}_{1}}=P_{{}_{a}}\), the atmospheric pressure, we have from Eq. (10.12)

\[\cdot\] \[P_{{}_{a}}\ \ \ \ \frac{1}{2}\ \ v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\ \ \ \ \ g\,y_{{}_{1}}\ \ \ \ P\ \ \ g\,y_{{}_{2}}\] \[\cdot\] \[v_{{}_{1}}\ \ \ \sqrt{2g\ h}\ \ \ \ \ \frac{2\ P\ P_{{}_{a}}}{2\ g\ h} \tag{10.14}\]

When \(P>\)\(>\)\(P_{{}_{a}}\) and \(2\ g\ h\) may be ignored, the speed of efflux is determined by the container pressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket propulsion. On the other hand if the tank is open to the atmosphere, then \(P=P_{{}_{a}}\)and

\[v_{{}_{1}}-\sqrt{2g\,h} \tag{10.15}\]

This is the speed of a freely falling body. Equation (10.15) is known as **Torricelli's law**.

### Venturi-meter

The Venturi-meter is a device to measure the flow speed of incompressible fluid. It consists of a tube with a broad diameter and a small constriction at the middle as shown in Fig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a U-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at the broad neck point of the tube and the other at constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The manometer contains a liquid of density \(\rho_{{}_{1}}\). The speed \(v_{{}_{1}}\) of the liquid flowing through the tube at the broad neck area \(A\) is to be measured from equation of continuity Eq. (10.10) the speed at the constriction becomes \(v_{{}_{2}}=\frac{A}{a}v_{{}_{1}}\). Then using Bernoulli's equation, we get

\[\cdot\] \[P_{{}_{1}}+\frac{1}{2}\ \ \ \rho v_{{}_{1}}^{2}=P_{{}_{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\ \ \ \rho v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\ (A/\alpha)^{2}\]

So that

\[P_{{}_{1}}-P_{{}_{2}}=\frac{1}{2}\ \ \ \rho v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\ [\left(\frac{A}{a} \right)^{2}-1] \tag{10.16}\]

This pressure difference causes the fluid in the U tube connected at the narrow neck to rise in comparison to the other arm. The difference in height \(h\) measure the pressure difference.

\[P_{{}_{1}}-P_{{}_{2}}=\rho_{{}_{\rm m}}gh=\frac{1}{2}\ \ \ \rho v_{{}_{1}}^{2}\left[\left(\frac{A}{a} \right)^{2}-1\right]\]

So that the speed of fluid at wide neck is

\[v_{{}_{1}}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\rho_{{}_{\rm m}}gh}{\rho}\right)}\ \left[\left(\frac{A}{a} \right)^{2}-1\right]^{-\alpha_{{}_{0}}} \tag{10.17}\]

The principle behind this meter has many applications. The carburetor of automobile has a Venturi channel (nozzle) through which air flows with a large speed. The pressure is then lowered at the narrow neck and the petrol (gasoline) is sucked up in the chamber to provide the correct mixture of air to fuel necessary for combustion. Filter pumps or aspirators, Bunsen burner, atomisers and sprayers [See Fig. 10.12] used for perfumes or to spray in secticticl des work on the same principle.

Figure 10.11: A schematic diagram of Venturi-meter \(r\).

Example 10.7 Blood velocity: The flow of blood in a large artery of an anesthetised dog is diverted through a Venturi meter. The wider part of the meter has a cross-sectional area equal to that of the artery. A = 8 mm\({}^{2}\). The narrower part has an area a = 4 mm\({}^{2}\). The pressure drop in the artery is 24 Pa. What is the speed of the blood in the artery?

Answer We take the density of blood from Table 10.1 to be \(1.06\times 10^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\). The ratio of the areas is \(\left(\frac{A}{a}\right)=2\). Using Eq. (10.17) we obtain

\(v_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times 24Pa}{1060\,\mathrm{kg}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\times\left(2^{2}-1 \right)}}=0.125\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)\(+\)

#### Blood Flow and Heart Attack

Bernoulli's principle helps in explaining blood flow in artery. The artery may get constricted due to the accumulation of plaque on its inner walls. In order to drive the blood through this constriction a greater demand is placed on the activity of the heart. The speed of the flow of the blood in this region is raised which lowers the pressure inside and the artery may collapse due to the external pressure. The heart exerts further pressure to open this artery and forces the blood through. As the blood rushes through the opening, the internal pressure once again drops due to same reasons leading to a repeat collapse. This may result in heart attack.

#### Dynamic Lift

Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body, such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning ball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball, or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through air. This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli's principle.

1. **Ball moving without spin**: Fig. 10.13(a) shows the streamlines around a non-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid. From the symmetry of streamlines it is clear that the velocity of fluid (air) above and below the ball at corresponding points is the same resulting in zero pressure difference. The air therefore, exerts no upward or downward force on the ball.
2. **Ball moving with spin**: A ball which is spinning drags air along with it. If the surface is rough more air will be dragged. Fig 10.13(b) shows the streamlines of air for a ball which is moving and spinning at the same time. The ball is moving forward and relative to it the air is moving backwards. Therefore, the velocity of air above the ball relative to it is larger and below it is smaller. The stream lines thus get crowded above and rarified below. This difference in the velocities of air results in the pressure difference between the lower and upper faces and their is a net upward force on the ball. This dynamic lift due to spinning is called **Magnus effect**.

Aerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13 (c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when it moves horizontally through air. The cross-section of the wings of an aeroplane looks somewhatlike the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c) with streamlines around it. When the aerofoil moves against the wind, the orientation of the wing relative to flow direction causes the streamlines to crowd together above the wing more than those below it. The flow speed on top is higher than that below it. There is an upward force resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and this balances the weight of the plane. The following example illustrates this._

```
1Example10.8A fully loaded Boeing aircraft has a mass of \(3.3\times 10^{5}\) kg, Its total wing area is 500 m\({}^{2}\). It is in level flight with a speed of 960 km/h. (a) Estimate the pressure difference between the lower and upper surfaces of the wings (b) Estimate the fractional increase in the speed of the air on the upper surface of the wing relative to the lower surface. [The density of air is = 1.2 kg m\({}^{2}\)]
```

_Answer_ (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is balanced by the upward force due to the pressure difference \(\Delta P\times A=3.3\times 10^{5}\) kg \(\times\) 9.8 \(\Delta P=\{3.3\times 10^{5}\) kg \(\times\) 9.8 m s\({}^{-2}\}\) / 500 m\({}^{2}\) = 6.5 \(\times 10^{3}\) Nm\({}^{2}\)

(b) We ignore the small height difference between the top and bottom sides in Eq. (10.12). The pressure difference between them is then

where \(v_{2}\) is the speed of air over the upper surface and \(v_{1}\) is the speed under the bottom surface.

\[v_{2}-v_{1}\quad\frac{2\ P}{v_{2}\ v_{1}}\]

Taking the average speed \(v_{2}=\{v_{2}+v_{1}\}/2=960\) km/h = 267 m s\({}^{-1}\), we have \(v_{2}-v_{1}\ /v_{\rm uv}\quad\frac{P}{v_{\rm uv}^{2}}=\ 0.08\)

The speed above the wing needs to be only 8 % higher than that below. \(\Box\)

### Viscosity

Most of the fluids are notideal ones and offer some resistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion is like aninternal friction analogous to friction when a solid moves on a surface. It is called viscosity. This force exists when there is relative motion between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider a fluid like oil enclosed between two glass plates as shown in Fig. 10.15 (a). The bottom plate is fixed while the top plate is moved with a constant velocity \(\blacktriangledown\) relative to the fixed plate. If oil is replaced by honey, a greater force is required to move the plate with the same velocity. Hence we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The fluid in contact with a surface has the same velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer of the liquid in contact with top surface moves with a velocity \(\blacktriangledown\) and the layer of the liquid in contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The velocities of layers increase uniformly from bottom (zero velocity to the top layer (velocity \(\blacktriangledown\)). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls it forward while lower layer pulls it backward. This results in force between the layers. This type of flow is known as laminar. The layers of liquid slide over one another as the pages of a book do when it is placed flat on a table and a horizontal force is applied to the top cover. When a fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then velocity of the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is maximum and decreases gradually as we move towards the walls where it becomes zero. Fig. 10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface in a tube is constant.

On account of this motion, a portion of liquid, which at some instant has the shape ABCD, take the shape of AEFD after short interval of time (\(\Delta t\)). During this time interval the liquid has undergone ashear strain of \(\Delta x/l\). Since, the strain in a flowing fluid increases with time continuously. Unlike a solid, here the stress is found experimentally to depend on 'rate of change of strain' or'strain rate' i.e. \(\Delta x/(l\ \Delta t)\) or \(v/l\) instead of strain itself. The coefficient of viscosity (pronounced 'eta') for a fluid is defined as the ratio of shearing stress to the strain rate. \(\cdot\)

\[\frac{F\ /\ A}{v/l}\quad\frac{FI}{v\ A} \tag{10.18}\]

The SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (PI). Its other units are N s m\({}^{2}\) or Pa s. The dimensions

### 10.7 Surface tension

You must have noticed that, oil and water do not mix; water wets you and me but not ducks; mercury does not wet glass but water sticks to it, oil rises up a cotton wick, inspite of gravity, Sap and water rise up to the top of the leaves of the tree, halrs of a paint brush do not cling together when dry and even when dipped in water but form a fine tip when taken out of it. All these and many more such experiences are related with the free surfaces of liquids. As liquids have no definite shape but have a definite volume, they acquire a free surface when poured in a container. These surfaces possess some additional energy. This phenomenon is known as surface tension and it is concerned with only liquid as gases do not have free surfaces. Let us now understand this phenomena.

### 10.7.1 Surface Energy

A liquid stays together because of attraction between molecules. Consider a molecule well inside aliquot. The intermolecular distances are such that it is attracted to all the surrounding molecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results in a negative potential energy for the molecule, which depends on the number and distribution of molecules around the chosen one. But the average potential energy of all the molecules is the same. This is supported by the fact that to take a collection of such molecules (the liquid) and to disperse them far away from each other in order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of evaporation required is quite large. For water it is of the order of 40 kJ/mol.

Let us consider a molecule near the surface Fig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is surrounded by liquid molecules. There is some negative potential energy due to these, but obviously it is less than that of a molecule in bulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately it is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a liquid surface have some extra energy in comparison to molecules in the interior. A liquid thus tends to have the least surface area which external conditions permit. Increasing surface area requires energy. Most surface phenomenon can be understood in terms of this fact. What is the energy required for having a molecule at the surface? As mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy required to remove it entirely from the liquid i.e., half the heat of evaporation.

Finally, what is a surface? Since a liquid consists of molecules moving about, there cannot be a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the liquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around z = 0 as we move along the direction indicated Fig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few molecular sizes.

**10.7.2** Surface Energy and Surface Tension

As we have discussed that an extra energy is associated with surface of liquids, the creation of more surface (spreading of surface) keeping other things like volume fixed requires additional energy. To appreciate this, consider a horizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide over parallel guides Fig (10.17).

Suppose that we move the bar by a small distance \(d\) as shown. Since the area of the surface increases, the system now has more energy, this means that some work has been done against an internal force. Let this internal force be \(F\), the work done by the applied force is \(F\)**-\(d\)** = \(Fd\). From conservation of energy, this is stored as additional energy in the film. If the surface energy of the film is \(S\) per unit area, the extra area is \(2\,dl\). A film has two sides and the liquid in between, so there are two surfaces and the extra energy is

\[S\,(2\,dl)=Fd \tag{10.23}\]

Or, \(S\)=\(Fd/2\,dl=F/2l\) (10.24)

This quantity \(S\) is the magnitude of surface tension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit area of the liquid in interface and is also equal to the force per unit length exerted by the fluid on the movable bar.

So far we have talked about the surface of one liquid. More generally, we need to consider fluid surface in contact with other fluids or solid surfaces. The surface energy in that case depends on the materials on both sides of the surface. For example, if the molecules of the materials attract each other, surface energy is reduced while if they repel each other the surface energy is increased. Thus, more appropriately, the surface energy is the energy of the interface between two materials and depends on both of them.

We make the following observations from above:

1. Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in the plane of the interface between the plane of the liquid and any other substance; it also is the extra energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to molecules in the interior.
2. At any point on the interface besides the boundary, we can draw a line and imagine equal and opposite surface tension forces \(S\) per unit length of the line acting perpendicular to the line, in the plane of the interface. The line is in equilibrium. To be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or molecules at the surface. The atoms to the left pull the line towards them; those to the right pull it towards them! This line of atoms is in equilibrium under tension. If the line really marks the end of the interface, as in

Figure 10.16: Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid at the surface and balance of forces. (a) Molecule inside a liquid. Forces on a molecule due to others are shown. Direction of arrows indicates attraction of repulsion. (b) Same. for a molecule at a surface. (c) Balance of attractive (A) and repulsive (R) forces.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:248]

\(S_{\rm in}\) cos \(\theta\) + \(S_{\rm sl}\) = \(S_{\rm sa}\) (10.26)

The angle of contact is an obtuse angle if \(S_{\rm sl}>S_{\rm in}\) as in the case of water-leaf interface while it is an acute angle if \(S_{\rm sl}<S_{\rm n}\) as in the case of water-plastic interface. When \(\theta\) is an obtuse angle then molecules of liquids are attracted strongly to themselves and weakly to those of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a liquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not wet the solid. This is what happens with water on a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on any surface. On the other hand, if the molecules of the liquid are strongly attracted to those of the solid, this will reduce \(S_{\rm sl}\) and therefore, cos \(\theta\) may increase or \(\theta\) may decrease. In this case \(\theta\) is an acute angle. This is what happens for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene oil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps, detergents and dying substances are wetting agents. When they are added the angle of contact becomes small so that these may penetrate well and become effective. Water proofing agents on the other hand are added to create a large angle of contact between the water and fibres.

#### Dropsand Bubbles

One consequence of surface tension is that free liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects of gravity can be neglected. You must have seen this especially clearly in small drops just formed in a high-speed spray orjet, and in soap bubbles blown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops and bubbles spherical? What keeps soap bubbles stable?

As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid-air interface has energy, so for a given volume the surface with minimum energy is the one with the least area. The sphere has this property. Though it is out of the scope of this book, but you can check that a sphere is better than at least a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and other forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective, liquid drops would be spherical.

Another interesting consequence of surface tension is that the pressure inside a spherical drop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure outside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is in equilibrium. If its radius increase by \(\Delta r\). The extra surface energy is

\[[4\pi(r+\Delta r)^{\frac{3}{2}}-4\pi r^{2}]\ S_{\rm in}=8\pi r\ \Delta r\ S_{\rm in} \tag{10.27}\]

If the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is balanced by the energy gain due to expansion under the pressure difference \((P_{i}-P_{o})\) between the inside of the bubble and the outside. The work done is

\(W=(P_{i}-P_{o})\ 4\pi r^{2}\Delta r\) (10.28)

so that

\((P_{i}-P_{o})=(2\ S_{\rm in}/r)\) (10.29)

In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the convex side has a higher pressure than the concave side. For example, an air bubble in a liquid, would have higher pressure inside it. See Fig 10.20 (b).

A bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop and a cavity: in this it has two interfaces. Applying the above argument we have for a bubble

\((P_{i}-P_{o})=(4\ S_{\rm in}/r)\) (10.30)

This is probably why you have to blow hard, but not too hard, to form a soap bubble. Alittle extra air pressure is needed inside!

#### Capillary Rise

One consequence of the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface is the well-known effect that water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means

(b) Enlarged picture near interface.

* _Example 10.12_ The lower end of a capillary tube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00 cm below the surface of water in a beaker. What is the pressure required in the tube in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at its end in water? The surface tension of water at temperature of the experiments is 7.30 \(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) N m-1.1 atmospheric pressure = 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa, density of water = 1000 kg/m, g = 9.80 m s\({}^{-2}\). Also calculate the excess pressure.

_Answer_ The excess pressure in a bubble of gas in a liquid is given by 2\(S\)/r, where \(S\) is the surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You should note there is only one liquid surface in this case. [For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for excess pressure in that case is 4\(S\)/r.] The radii of the bubble is r. Now the pressure outside the bubble \(P_{o}\) equals atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of water column. That is \(P_{o}\) = (1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa + 0.08 m \(\times\) 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\) \(\times\) 9.80 m s\({}^{-2}\)) = 1.01 784 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa

Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is \(P_{i}\) = \(P_{o}\) + 2\(S\)/r = 1.01784 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa + (2 \(\times\) 7.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\) Pa m/10\({}^{-3}\) m) = (1.01784 + 0.00146) \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa

where the radius of the bubble is taken to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube, since the bubble is hemispherical! (The answer has been rounded off to three significant figures.) The excess pressure in the bubble is 146 Pa+

## Summary

* The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the shape of its container.
* A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible and it expands to occupy all the space available to it.
* If \(F\) is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area \(A\) then the average pressure \(P_{av}\) is defined as the ratio of the force to area \(P_{av}=\frac{F}{A}\)
* The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m-2. Other common units of pressure are 1 atm = 1.01\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) Pa 1 bar = 10\({}^{5}\) Pa 1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa
* _Pascal's law_ states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at the same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.
* The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression \(P=P_{a}+pgh\) where \(p\) is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.
* The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of non uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow. \(vA\) = constant (\(v\) is the velocity and \(A\) is the area of crossection) The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.
* _Bernoulli's principle_ states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the pressure (\(P\)), the kinetic energy per unit volume (\(\rho v^{2}\)/2) and the potential energy per unit volume (\(\rho gy\)) remains a constant. \(P+\rho v^{2}/2+\rho gy\) = constant

## Appendix 10.1 : What is blood pressure?

In evolutionary history there occurred a time when animals started spending a significant amount of time in the upright position. This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The venous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You will recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and animals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity. But animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in the lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart.

_Fig. 10.26_: _Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while standing or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle._

Figure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body. Since viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli's equation, Eq. (10.13),

\[P\quad\frac{1}{2}\quad v^{2}\quad g\quad\varrho\quad\text{Constant}\]

to understand these pressure values. The kinetic energy term (\(\varrho\)\(v^{2}\)/2) can be ignored since the velocities in the three arteries are small (\(=0.1\) m s-i) and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain \(P_{\varrho}\) the heart \(P_{\varrho}\) and the foot \(P_{\varrho}\)are related by

\[P_{\varrho}=P_{\varrho}+\ \varrho\ g\ h_{\varrho}=P_{\varrho}+\ \varrho\ g\ h_{\varrho} \tag{10.34}\]

where \(\varrho\) is the density of blood.

Typical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are \(h_{\varrho}=1.3\) m and \(h_{\varrho}=1.7\) m. Taking \(\varrho=1.06\times 10^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\) we obtain that \(P_{\varrho}=26.8\) kPa (kilopascals) and \(P_{\varrho}=9.3\) kPa given that \(P_{\varrho}=13.3\) kPa. Thus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing, but are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more commonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa. Thus the average pressure at the heart is \(P_{\varrho}=13.3\) kPa = 100 mm of Hg.

The human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves, which open when blood flows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned at least partially by the pumpingaction associated with breathing and by the flexing of the skeletal muscles during walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of insufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized and he regains consciousness.

An instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a fast, painless and non-invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patient's health. The measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First, it is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly, the upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there (called the brachial artery) easy to compress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist. Each pulse takes a little less than a second. During each pulse the pressure in the heart and the circulatory system goes through amaximum as the blood is pumped by the heart (**systolic pressure**) and a minimum as the heart relaxes (**diastolic pressure**). The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It works on the principle that **blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from laminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent flow is dissipative, and its sound can be picked up on the stethoscope.

The gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a dial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed. The pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to listen to noises arising in the brachial artery. When the pressure is just below the **systolic** (peak) pressure, the artery opens briefly. During this brief period, the blood velocity in the highly constricted artery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The resulting noise is heard as a **tapping sound** on the stethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is lowered further, the artery remains open for a longer portion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains closed during the **diastolic** (minimum pressure) phase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the tapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the sack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is open during the entire heart cycle. The flow is however, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a tapping sound we hear a steady, continuous road on the stethoscope.

The blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic/diastolic pressures. For a resting healthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical attention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and must be controlled.

## Chapter 1 Thermal Properties of Matter

### 1.1 Introduction

We all have common-sense notions of heat and temperature. Temperature is a measure of 'hotness' of a body. A kettle with boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice. In physics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperature, etc., more carefully. In this chapter, you will learn what heat is and how it is measured, and study the various processes by which heat flows from one body to another. Along the way, you will find out why blacksmiths heat the iron ring before fitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a bullock cart and why the wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun goes down. You will also learn what happens when water boils or freezes, and its temperature does not change during these processes even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or out of it.

### 1.2 Temperature and Heat

We can begin studying thermal properties of matter with definitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative measure, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil is said to have a high temperature, and ice cube to have a low temperature. An object that has a higher temperature than another object is said to be hotter. Note that hot and cold are relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive temperature by touch. However, this temperature sense is somewhat unreliable and its range is too limited to be useful for scientific purposes.

We know from experience that a glass of ice-cold water left on a table on a hot summer day eventually warms up whereas a cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that when the temperature of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in this case, and its surrounding medium are different, heat transfer takes place between the system and the surrounding medium, until the body and the surrounding medium are at the same temperature. We also know that in the case of glass, tumbler of ice cold water, heat flows from the environment tothe glass tumbler, whereas in the case of hot tea, it flows from the cup of hot tea to the environment. So, we can say that heat is the form of energy transferred between two (or more) systems or a system and its surroundings by virtue of temperature difference. The SI unit of heat energy transferred is expressed in joule (J) while SI unit of temperature is kelvin (K). and 'C is a commonly used unit of temperature. When an object is heated, many changes may take place. Its temperature may rise, it may expand or change state. We will study the effect of heat on different bodies in later sections.

### Measurement of temperature

A measure of temperature is obtained using a thermometer. Many physical properties of materials change sufficiently with temperature to be used as the basis for constructing thermometers. The commonly used property is variation of the volume of a liquid with temperature. For example, a common thermometer (the liquid-in-glass type) with which you are familiar. Mercury and alcohol are the liquids used in most liquid-in-glass thermometers.

Therometers are calibrated so that a numerical value may be assigned to a given temperature. For the definition of any standard scale, two fixed reference points are needed. Since all substances change dimensions with temperature. an absolute reference for expansion is not available. However, the necessary fixed points may be correlated to physical phenomena that always occur at the same temperature. The ice point and the steam point of water are two convenient fixed points and are known as the freezing and boiling points. These two points are the temperatures at which pure water freezes and boils under standard pressure. The two familiar temperature scales are the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the Celisust temperature scale. The ice and steam point have values 32 \({}^{\circ}\)F and 212 \({}^{\circ}\)F respectively, on the Fahrenheit scale and 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the Celisus scale. On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal intervals between two reference points, and on the celisus scale, there are 100.

A relationship for converting between the two scales may be obtained from a graph of Fahrenheit temperature (\(t_{p}\)) versus celisus temperature (\(t_{c}\)) in a straight line (Fig. 11.1), whose equation is

\[\frac{t_{r}-32}{180}=\frac{t_{c}}{100} \tag{11.1}\]

### Ideal-gas equation and absolute temperature

Liquid-in-glass thermometers show different readings for temperatures other than the fixed points because of differing expansion properties. A thermometer that uses a gas, however, gives the same readings regardless of which gas is used. Experiments show that all gases at low densities exhibit same expansion behaviour. The variables that describe the behaviour of a given quantity (mass) of gas are pressure, volume, and temperature (\(P\), \(V\). and \(T\))(where \(T=t+273.15\); \(t\) is the temperature in \({}^{\circ}\)C). When temperature is held constant, the pressure and volume of a quantity of gas are related as \(PV\) = constant. This relationship is known as Boyle's law. after Robert Boyle (1627-1691) the English Chemist who discovered it. When the pressure is held constant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is related to the temperature as \(V/T\) = constant. This relationship is known as Charles' law, after the French scientist Jacques Charles (1747-1823). Low density gases obey these laws, which may be combined into a single relationship.

Notice that since \(PV=\) constant and \(V/T=\) constant for a given quantity of gas, then \(PV/T\) should also be a constant. This relationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be written in a more general form that applies notjust to a given quantity of a single gas but to any quantity of any dilute gas and is known as **ideal-gas equation**:

\[\frac{PV}{T}=\mu R\]

or \(PV=\mu RT\) (11.2)

where, \(\mu\) is the number of moles in the sample of gas and \(R\) is called universal gas constant:

\(R=8.31\) J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)

In Eq. 11.2, we have learnt that the pressure and volume are directly proportional to temperature : \(PV\propto T\). This relationship allows a gas to be used to measure temperature in a constant volume gas thermometer. Holding the volume of a gas constant, it gives \(P\sim\)\(T\). Thus, with a constant-volume gas thermometer, temperature is read in terms of pressure. A plot of pressure versus temperature gives a straight line in this case, as shown in Fig. 11.2.

However, measurements on real gases deviate from the values predicted by the ideal gas law at low temperature. But the relationship is linear over a large temperature range, and it looks as though the pressure might reach zero with decreasing temperature if the gas continued to be a gas. The absolute minimum temperature for an ideal gas, therefore, inferred by extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in Fig. 11.3. This temperature is found to be - 273.15 \({}^{\circ}\)C and is designated as **absolute zero**. Absolute zero is the foundation of the Kelvin temperature scale or absolute scale temperature named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin. On this scale, - 273.15 \({}^{\circ}\)C is taken as the zero point, that is 0 K (Fig. 11.4).

The size of the unit for Kelvin temperature is the same celsius degree, so temperature on these scales are related by

\[T=t_{\rm C}+273.15 \tag{11.3}\]

### Thermal Expansion

You may have observed that sometimes sealed bottles with metallic lids are so tightly screwed that one has to put the lid in hot water for sometime to open the lid. This would allow the metallic cover to expand, thereby loosening it to un screw easily. In case of liquids, you may have observed that mercury in a thermometer rises, when the thermometer is put in a slightly warm water. If we take out the thermometer from the

Figure 11.2: Pressure versus temperature of a low density gas kept at constant volume.

Figure 11.4: Comparison of the Kelvin, Celsius and Farrenheit temperature scales.

warm water the level of mercury falls again. Similarly, in the case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a cool room may expand to full size when placed in warm water. On the other hand, a fully inflated balloon when immersed in cold water would start shrinking due to contraction of the air inside.

It is our common experience that most substances expand on heating and contract on cooling. A change in the temperature of a body causes change in its dimensions. The increase in the dimensions of a body due to the increase in its temperature is called thermal expansion. The expansion in length is called **linear expansion**. The expansion in area is called **area expansion**. The expansion in volume is called **volume expansion** (Fig. 11.5).

If the substance is in the form of a long rod, then for small change in temperature, \(\Delta T\), the fractional change in length, \(\Delta l/l\), is directly proportional to \(\Delta T\).

\[\frac{\Delta l}{l}=\alpha_{{}_{1}}\Delta T \tag{11.4}\]

where \(\alpha_{{}_{i}}\) is known as the **coefficient of linear expansion** and is characteristic of the material of the rod. In Table 11.1 are given typical average values of the coefficient of linear expansion for some materials in the temperature range 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C. From this Table, compare the value of \(\alpha_{{}_{i}}\) for glass and copper. We find that copper expands about five times more than glass for the same rise in temperature. Normally, metals expand more and have relatively high values of \(\alpha_{{}_{i}}\).

Similarly, we consider the fractional change in volume. \(\frac{\Delta V}{V}\), of a substance for temperature change \(\Delta T\) and define the **coefficient of volume expansion**. \(\alpha_{{}_{V}}\) as

\[\alpha_{{}_{V}}=\left(\frac{\Delta V}{V}\right)\frac{1}{\Delta T} \tag{11.5}\]

Here \(\alpha_{{}_{V}}\) is also a characteristic of the substance but is not strictly a constant. It depends in general on temperature (Fig 11.6). It is seen that \(\alpha_{{}_{V}}\) becomes constant only at a high temperature.

Table 11.2 gives the values of co-efficient of volume expansion of some common substances in the temperature range 0 -100 \({}^{\circ}\)C. You can see that thermal expansion of these substances (solids and liquids) is rather small, with

Figure 11.6: Coefficient of volume expansion of copper as a function of temperature.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Materials & \(\alpha_{{}_{1}}\)(0.1.8) \\ Aluminium & 2.5 \\ Brass & 1.8 \\ Iron & 1.2 \\ Copper & 1.7 \\ Silver & 1.9 \\ Gold & 1.4 \\ Glass (pyrex) & 0.32 \\ Lead & 0.29 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11.1: Values of coefficient of linear expansion forsome materialsmaterials like pyrex glass and invar (a special iron-nickel alloy) having particularly low values of \(\alpha_{v}\). From this Table we find that the value of \(\alpha_{v}\) for alcohol (ethyl) is more than mercury and expands more than mercury for the same rise in temperature.

Water exhibits an anomalous behavour; it contracts on heating between 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The volume of a given amount of water decreases as it is cooled from room temperature, until its temperature reaches 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. [Fig. 11.7(a)]. Below 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. the volume increases, and therefore the density decreases [Fig. 11.7(b)].

This means that water has a maximum density at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. This property has an important environmental effect: Bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake cools toward 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, water near the surface loses energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and sinks; the warmer, less dense water near the bottom rises. However, once the colder water on top reaches temperature below 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, it becomes less dense and remains at the surface, where it freezes. If water did not have this property, lakes and ponds would freeze from the bottom up, which would destroy much of their animal and plant life.

Gases at ordinary temperature expand more than solids and liquids. For liquids, the coefficient of volume expansion is relatively independent of the temperature. However, for gases it is dependent on temperature. For an ideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion at constant pressure can be found from the ideal gas equation :

\(PV=\mu RT\)

At constant pressure

\(P\Delta V=\mu R\ \Delta T\)

\(\frac{\Delta V}{V}=\frac{\Delta T}{T}\)

i.e. \(\alpha_{v}=\frac{1}{T}\) for ideal gas (11.6)

At 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. \(\alpha_{v}=3.7\times 10^{-3}\) K\({}^{-1}\), which is much larger than that for solids and liquids. Equation (11.6) shows the temperature dependence of \(\alpha_{v}\); it decreases with increasing temperature. For a gas at room temperature and constant pressure \(\alpha_{v}\) is about 33 00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\)K\({}^{-1}\), as

Figure 11.7: Thermal expansion of water

\end{table}
Table 11.2: Values of coefficient of volume expansion forsome substancesmuch as order(s) of magnitude larger than the coefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids.

There is a simple relation between the coefficient of volume expansion (\(\alpha_{v}\)) and coefficient of linear expansion (\(\alpha\)). Imagine a cube of length, \(l\), that expands equally in all directions, when its temperature increases by \(\Delta T\). We have

\(\Delta l=\alpha_{l}\,1\,\Delta T\)

so, \(\Delta V=(l+\Delta)^{\alpha_{l}}-\mathbb{F}^{\circ}\); \(3\,\mathbb{F}\,\Delta l\)

In equation (11.7), terms in \(\{\Delta l\}^{2}\) and \(\{\Delta l\}^{3}\) have been neglected since \(\Delta l\) is small compared to \(l\). So

\[\Delta V=\frac{3V\,\Delta l}{l}=3V\alpha_{l}\,\Delta T \tag{11.8}\]

which gives

\[\alpha_{v}=3\alpha_{l} \tag{11.9}\]

What happens by preventing the thermal expansion of a rod by fixing its ends rigidly? Clearly, the rod acquires a compressive strain due to the external forces provided by the rigid support at the ends. The corresponding stress set up in the rod is called **thermal stress**. For example, consider a steel rail of length 5 m and area of cross section 40 cm\({}^{2}\) that is prevented from expanding while the temperature rises by 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The coefficient of linear expansion of steel is \(\alpha_{\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}}=1.2\times 10^{\circ 5}\) K\({}^{-1}\). Thus, the compressive strain is \(\frac{\Delta l}{l}=\alpha_{\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{ \tiny{I}}}\Delta T=1.2\times 10^{\circ}\times 10=1.2\times 10^{\circ}\). Youngs modulus of steel is \(Y_{\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}} =2\times 10^{\circ 1}\) N m\({}^{-2}\). Therefore, the thermal stress developed is \(\frac{\Delta F}{A}=Y_{steel}\left(\frac{\Delta l}{l}\right)=2.4\times 10^{ \circ}\) N m\({}^{-2}\), which corresponds to an external force of

\[\Delta F=AY_{\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}\text{\tiny{I}}}\left(\frac{\Delta l }{l}\right)=2.4\times 10^{ \circ}\times 40\times 10^{\circ}\simeq 10^{\circ}\text{N}.\]

If two such steel rails, fixed at their outer ends, are in contact at their inner ends, a force of this magnitude can easily bend the rails.

**Example 11.1**: Show that the coefficient of area expansions. (\(\Delta A/A\))/\(\Delta T\), of a rectangular sheet of the solid is twice its linear expansivity, \(\alpha_{l}\).

Consider a rectangular sheet of the solid material of length \(a\) and breadth \(b\) (Fig. 11.8 ). When the temperature increases by \(\Delta T\), \(a\) increases by \(\Delta a=\alpha_{l}\,a\Delta T\) and \(b\) increases by \(\Delta b\) = \(\alpha_{l}b\,\Delta T\). From Fig. 11.8. the increase in area \(\Delta A\) = \(\Delta A_{1}+\Delta A_{2}+\Delta A_{3}\)

\(\Delta A\) = \(a\,\Delta b\) + \(b\,\Delta a+(\Delta a)\) (\(\Delta b\))

= \(a\,\alpha_{l}b\,\Delta T+b\,\alpha_{l}\,a\,\Delta T+\{\alpha\}^{2}\,ab\) (\(\Delta T\))

= \(q\,ab\,\Delta T\,(2+q\,\Delta T)=\alpha_{l}\,A\,\Delta T\,(2+\alpha_{l}\, \Delta T)\)

Since \(\alpha_{l}\); \(10^{\circ}\) K\({}^{-1}\), from Table 11.1, the product \(\alpha_{l}\,\Delta T\) for fractional temperature is small in comparision with 2 and may be neglected. Hence,

\[\left(\frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)\frac{1}{\Delta T}=2\alpha_{l}\]

**Example 11.2**: A blackssmith fixes iron ring on the rim of the wooden wheel of a bullock cart. The diameter of the rim and the iron ring are 5.243 m and 5.231 m respectively at 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C. To what temperature should the ring be heated so as to fit the rim of the wheel?

**Given.**\(T_{1}\) = 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C

\(L_{\text{\tiny{I}}_{1}}\) = 5.231 m

\(L_{\text{\tiny{I}}_{2}}\) = 5.243 m

**So.**\(L_{\text{\tiny{I}}_{2}}\) = \(L_{\text{\tiny{I}}_{1}}\) [1+\(\alpha_{l}\,(T_{2}-T_{1})\)]

5.243 m = 5.231 m [1 + 1.20\(\times\)1

### Specific Heat Capacity

Take some water in a vessel and start heatingt on a burner, Soon you will notice that bubbles begin to move upward. As the temperature is raised the motion of water particles increases till it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling. What are the factors on which the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance depend? In order to answer this question in the first step, heat a given quantity of water to raise its temperature by, say 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C and note the time taken. Again take the same amount of water and raise its temperature by 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C using the same source of heat. Note the time taken by using a stopwatch. You will find it takes about twice the time and therefore, double the quantity of heat required raising twice the temperature of same amount of water.

In the second step, now suppose you take double the amount of water and heat it, using the same heating arrangement, to raise the temperature by 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C, you will find the time taken is again twice that required in the first step.

In the third step, in place of water, now heat the same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil, and raise the temperature again by 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Now note the time by the same stopwatch. You will find the time taken will be shorter and therefore, the quantity of heat required would be less than that required by the same amount of water for the same rise in temperature.

The above observations show that the quantity of heat required to warm a given substance depends on its mass, \(m\), the change in temperature, \(\Delta T\) and the nature of substance. The change in temperature of a substance, when a given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected by it, is characterised by a quantity called the **heat capacity** of that substance. We define heat capacity, \(S\) of a substance as

\[\cdot\]

\[S=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}\]

where \(\Delta Q\) is the amount of heat supplied to the substance to change its temperature from \(T\) to \(T+\Delta T\).

You have observed that if equal amount of heat is added to equal masses of different substances, the resulting temperature changes will not be the same. It implies that every substance has a unique value for the amount of heat absorbed or rejected to change the temperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This quantity is referred to as the **specific heat capacity** of the substance.

If \(\Delta Q\) stands for the amount of heat absorbed or rejected by a substance of mass \(m\) when it undergoes a temperature change \(\Delta T\), then the specific heat capacity, of that substance is given by

\[s=\frac{S}{m}=\frac{1}{m}\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}\]

The **specific heat capacity** is the property of the substance which determines the change in the temperature of the substance (undergoing no phase change) when a given quantity of heat is absorbed (or rejected) by it. It is defined as the amount of heat per unit mass absorbed or rejected by the substance to change its temperature by one unit. It depends on the nature of the substance and its temperature. The SI unit of specific heat capacity is \(J\) kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

If the amount of substance is specified in terms of moles \(\mu\), instead of mass \(m\) in kg, we can define heat capacity per mole of the substance by

\[C=\frac{S}{\mu}=\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}\]

where \(C\) is known as **molar specific heat capacity** of the substance. Like \(S\), \(C\) also depends on the nature of the substance and its temperature. The SI unit of molar specific heat capacity is \(J\) mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

However, in connection with specific heat capacity of gases, additional conditions may be needed to define \(C\). In this case, heat transfer can be achieved by keeping either pressure or volume constant. If the gas is held under constant pressure during the heat transfer, then it is called the **molar specific heat capacity at constant pressure** and is denoted by \(C_{p}\). On the other hand, if the volume of the gas is maintained during the heat transfer, then the corresponding molar specific heat capacity is called **molar specific heat capacity at constant volume** and is denoted by \(C_{v}\). For details see Chapter 12. Table 11.3 lists measured specific heat capacity of some substances at atmospheric pressure and ordinary temperature while Table 11.4 lists molar specific heat capacities of some gases. From Table 11.3 you can note that waterhas the highest specific heat capacity compared to other substances. For this reason water is used as a coolant in automobile radiators as well as a heater in hot water bags. Owing to its high specific heat capacity, the water warms up much more slowly than the land during summer and consequently wind from the sea has a cooling effect. Now, you can tell why in desert areas. the earth surface warms up quickly during the day and cools quickly at night.

### Calorimetry

A system is said to be isolated if no exchange or transfer of heat occurs between the system and its surroundings. When different parts of an isolated system are at different temperature, a quantity of heat transfers from the part at higher temperature to the part at lower temperature. The heat lost by the part at higher temperature is equal to the heat gained by the part at lower temperature.

Calorimetry means measurement of heat. When a body at higher temperature is brought in contact with another body at lower temperature, the heat lost by the hot body is equal to the heat gained by the colder body. provided no heat is allowed to escape to the surroundings. A device in which heat measurement can be made is called a calorimeter. It consists a metallic vessel and stirrer of the same material like copper or aluminum. The vessel is kept inside a wooden jacket which contains heat insulating materials like glass wool etc. The outer jacket acts as a heat shield and reduces the heat loss from the inner vessel. There is an opening in the outer jacket through which a mercury thermometer can be inserted into the calorimeter. The following example provides a method by which the specific heat capacity of a given solid can be determinated by using the principle, heat gained is equal to the heat lost.

[width=1.5]

**Example 11.3**: A sphere of aluminium of 0.047 kg placed for sufficient time in a vessel containing boiling water, so that the sphere is at 100. It is then immediately transfered to 0.14 kg copper calorimeter containing 0.25 kg of water at 20. The temperature of water rises and attains a steady state at 23. Calculate the specific heat capacity of aluminum.

_Answer_ **In solving this example we shall use the fact that at a steady state, heat given by an aluminium sphere will be equal to the heat absorbed by the water and calorimeter.**

**Mass of aluminium sphere () = 0.047 kg**

**Initial temp. of aluminium sphere = 100.**

**Final temp. = 23.**

**Change in temp () =(100.**

**C - 23.**

**C ) = 77.**

**Let specific heat capacity of aluminium be.**

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}||p{113.8pt}||p{113.8pt}||} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c||}{Subsurface} & \multicolumn{1}{c||}{Specific heat capacity} & \multicolumn{1}{c||}{Subsurface} & \multicolumn{1}{c||}{Specific heat capacity} \\  & (kgkg) & & (0.8kg) \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 11.3: Specific heat capacity of some substances at room temperature and atmospheric pressure The amount of heat lost by the aluminium sphere = heat gained by water + heat gained by calorimeter. So, 0.047 kg \(\times\) s\({}_{\rm Au}\times 77\)\({}^{\circ}\)C = (0.25 kg \(\times\) 4.18 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\circ}\) J kg\({}^{\rm-1}\) K\({}^{\rm-1}\) + 0.14 kg \(\times\) 0.386 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\circ}\) J kg\({}^{\rm-1}\) K\({}^{\rm-1}\))(3 \({}^{\circ}\)C) \(s_{\rm Au}\) = 0.911 kJ kg\({}^{\rm-1}\) K\({}^{\rm-1}\) +

### Change of state

Matter normally exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. A transition from one of these states to another is called a change of state. Two common changes of states are solid to liquid and liquid to gas (and vice versa). These changes can occur when the exchange of heat takes place between the substance and its surroundings. To study the change of state on heating or cooling, let us perform the following activity.

Take some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the temperature of ice (0\({}^{\circ}\)C). Start heating it slowly on a constant heat source. Note the temperature after every minute. Continuously stir the mixture of water and ice. Draw a graph between temperature and time (Fig. 9). You will observe no change in the temperature so long as there is ice in the beaker. In the above process, the temperature of the system does not change even though heat is being continuously supplied. The heat supplied is being utilised in changing the state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).

The change of state from solid to liquid is called **melting** and from liquid to solid is called **fusion**. It is observed that the temperature remains constant until the entire amount of the solid substance melts. That is, **both the solid and liquid states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium during the change of states from solid to liquid.** The temperature at which the solid and the liquid states of the substance in thermal equilibrium with each other is called its **melting point**. It is characteristic of the substance. It also depends on pressure. The melting point of a substance at standard atomspheric pressure is called its **normal melting point**. Let us do the following activity to understand the process of melting of ice.

Take a slab of ice. Take a metallic wire and fix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put the wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 9. You will observe that the wire passes through the ice slab. This happens due to the fact that just below the wire, ice melts at lower temperature due to increase in pressure. When the wire has passed, water above the wire freezes again. Thus the wire passes through the slab and the slab does not split. This phenomenon of refreezing is called **regelation**. Skating is possible on snow due to the formation of water below the **skates**. Water is formed due to the increase of pressure and it acts as lubricant.

Figure 9: A plot of temperature versus us times showing the changes in the state of ice on heating (not to scale).

Figure 11.10**

**After the whole of ice gets converted into water and as we continue further heating, we shall see that temperature begins to rise. The temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C when it again becomes steady. The heat supplied is now being utilised to change water from liquid state to vapour or gaseous state.**

**The change of state from liquid to vapour (or gas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that the temperature remains constant until the entire amount of the liquid is converted into vapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium, during the change of state from liquid to vapour. The temperature at which the liquid and the vapour states of the substance coexist is called its boiling point. Let us do the following activity to understand the process of boiling of water.**

**Take a round-bottom flask, more than half filled with water. Keep it over a burner and fix a Triple Point**

**The temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state (phase change). A graph between the temperature** \(T\) **and the Pressure** \(P\) **of the substance is called a phase diagram or** \(P-T\) **diagram. The following figure shows the phase diagram of water and CO**\({}_{2}\)**. Such a phase diagram divides the** \(P-T\) **plane into a solid-region, the vapour-region and the liquid-region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion curve (AO) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states in which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO represent states in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent states in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent states in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which the fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the three phases of a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the triple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.11\(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\)\(R\).**thermometer and steam outlet through the cork of the flask (Fig. 11.11). As water gets heated in the flask, note first that the air, which was dissolved in the water, will come out as small bubbles. Later, bubbles of steam will form at the bottom but as they rise to the cooler water near the top. they condense and disappear. Finally, as the temperature of the entire mass of the water reaches 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, bubbles of steam reach the surface and boiling is said to occur. The steam in the flask may not be visible but as it comes out of the flask. it condenses as tiny droplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.

_Fig. 11.11 Boiling process._

If now the steam outlet is closed for a few seconds to increase the pressure in the flask. you will notice that boiling stops. More heat would be required to raise the temperature (depending on the increase in pressure) before boiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases with increase in pressure.

Let us now remove the burner. Allow water to cool to about 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Remove the thermometer and steam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight cork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the stand. Pour ice-cdd water on the flask. Water vapours in the flask condense reducing the pressure on the water surface inside the flask. Water begins to boil again. now at a lower temperature. Thus boiling point decreases with decrease in pressure.

This explains why cooking is difficult on hills. At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower. reducing the boiling point of water as compared to that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling point is increased inside a pressure cooker by increasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster. The boiling point of a substance at standard atmospheric pressure is called its **normal boiling point**.

However, all substances do not pass through the three states: solid-liquid-gas. There are certain substances which normally pass from the solid to the vapour state directly and vice versa. The change from solid state to vapour state without passing through the liquid state is called **sublimation**, and the substance is said to sublime. Dry ice (solid CO\({}_{2}\)) sublimes. so also iodine. During the sublimation process both the solid and vapour states of a substance coexist in thermal equilibrium.

#### Latent Heat

In Section 11.8, we have learnt that certain amount of heat energy is transferred between a substance and its surroundings when it undergoes a change of state. The amount of heat per unit mass transferred during change of state of the substance is called latent heat of the substance for the process. For example, if heat is added to a given quantity of ice at -10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. the temperature of ice increases until it reaches its melting point (0 \({}^{\circ}\)C). At this temperature, the addition of more heat does not increase the temperature but causes the ice to melt. or changes its state. Once the entire ice melts, adding more heat will cause the temperature of the water to rise. A similar situation occurs during liquid gas change of state at the boiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water causes vaporisation, without increase in temperature.

The heat required during a change of state depends upon the heat of transformation and the mass of the substance undergoing a change of state. Thus, if mass \(m\) of a substance undergoes a change from one state to the other, then the quantity of heat required is given by

\(\mathcal{G}=m\,L\)

or \(L=\mathcal{G}/m\) (11.13)

where \(L\) is known as latent heat and is a characteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is J kg-1. The value of \(L\) also depends on the pressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard atmospheric pressure. The latent heat for a solid-liquid state change is called the **latent heat of fusion** (\(L_{t}\)), and that for a liquid-gas state change is called the **latent heat of vaporisation** (\(L_{t}\)). These are often referred to as the heat of fusion and the heat of vaporisation. A plot of temperature versus heat energy for a quantity of water is shown in Fig. 11.12. The latent heats of some substances, their freezing and boiling points, are given in Table 11.5.

Note that when heat is added (or removed) during a change of state, the temperature remains constant. Note in Fig. 11.12 that the slopes of the phase lines are not all the same, which indicates that specific heats of the various states are not equal. For water, the latent heat of fusion and vaporisation are \(L_{t}=3.33\times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{J}\) kg-1 and \(L_{t}=22.6\times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{J}\) kg-1 respectively. That is \(3.33\times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{J}\) of heat are needed to melt 1 kg of ice at \(0\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\), and \(22.6\times 10^{6}\,\mathrm{J}\) of heat are needed to convert 1 kg of water to steam at \(100\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\). So, steam at \(100\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) carries \(22.6\times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{J}\) kg-1 more heat than water at \(100\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\). This is why burns from steam are usually more serious than those from boiling water.

_Example 11.4_: When \(0.15\) kg of ice of \(0\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) mixed with \(0.30\) kg of water at \(50\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) in a container, the resulting temperature is \(6.7\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\). Calculate the heat of fusion of ice. [\(\mathrm{s}_{water}=4186\,\mathrm{J}\) kg-1]

_Answer_

Heat lost by water = \(m_{w}\,\{\theta_{t}\!-\!\theta_{t}\!\}_{w}\)

= (0.30 kg)(4186 J kg-1 K-1) (50.0 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\)-6.7 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\))

= 54376.14 J

Heat required to melt ice = \(m_{2}L_{t}=\{0.15\) kg\(\}\)\(L_{t}\)

Heat required to raise temperature of ice water to final temperature = \(m_{5}S_{w}\,\{\theta_{t}\!-\!\theta_{t}\!\}_{w}\)

= (0.15 kg) (4186 J kg-1 K-1) (6.7 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\)-0 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\))

= 4206.93 J

Heat lost = heat gained

54376.14 J = (0.15 kg) \(L_{t}\) + 4206.93 J

\(L_{t}=3.34\times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{J}\) kg-1.

Table 11.5: Temperatures of the change of state and latent heats for various substances at 1 atm pressure 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:271]

experimentally that in this steady state, the rate of flow of heat(or heat current) \(H\) is proportional to the temperature difference (\(T_{c}-T_{\rm p}\)) and the area of cross section \(A\) and is inversely proportional to the length \(L\) :

\[H=K\dot{A}\frac{T_{c}-T_{\rm p}}{L} \tag{11.14}\]

The constant of proportionality \(K\) is called the **thermal conductivity** of the material. The greater the value of \(K\) for a material, the more rapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of \(K\) is J S-1 m-1 K-1 or W m-1 K-1. The thermal conductivities of various substances are listed in Table 11.5. The se values vary slightly with temperature, but can be considered to be constant over a normal temperature range.

Compare the relatively large thermal conductivities of the good thermal conductors, the metals, with the relatively small thermal conductivities of some good thermal insulators, such as wood and glass wool. You may have noticed that some cooking pots have copper coating on the bottom. Being a good conductor of heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat over the bottom of a pot for uniform cooking. Plastic foams, on the other hand, are good insulators, mainly because they contain pockets of air. Recall that gases are poor conductors, and note the low thermal conductivity of air in the Table 11.5. Heat retention and transfer are important in many other applications. Houses made of concrete roofs get very hot during summer days, because thermal conductivity of concrete (though much smaller than that of a metal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people usually prefer to give a layer of earth or foam insulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer is prohibited and keeps the room cooler. In some situations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear reactor, for example, elaborate heat transfer systems need to be installed so that the enormous energy produced by nuclear fission in the core transits out sufficiently fast, thus preventing the core from overheating.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:273]

#### Convection

Convection is a mode of heat transfer by actual motion of matter. It is possible only in fluids. Convection can be natural or forced. In natural convection, gravity plays an important part. When a fluid is heated from below, the hot part expands and, therefore, becomes less dense. Because of buoyancy, it rises and the upper colder part replaces it. This again gets heated, rises up and is replaced by the colder part of the fluid, The process goes on, This mode of heat transfer is evidently different from conduction, Convection involves bulk transport of different parts of the fluid. In forced convection, material is forced to move by a pump or by some other physical means, The common examples of forced convection systems are forced-air heating systems in home, the human circulatory system, and the cooling system of an automobile engine. In the human body, the heart acts as the pump that circulates blood through different parts of the body, transferring heat by forced convection and maintaining it at a uniform temperature.

Natural convection is responsible for many familiar phenomena. During the day, the ground heats up more quickly than large bodies of water do. This occurs both because the water has a greater specific heat and because mixing currents disperse the absorbed heat throughout the great volume of water. The air in contact with the warm ground is heated by conduction. It expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the warm air rises (air currents) and other air moves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea breeze near a large body of water. Cooler air descends, and a thermal convection cycle is set up. which transfers heat away from the land. At night, the ground loses its heat more quickly, and the water surface is warmer than the land. As a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 11.17).

The other example of natural convection is the steady surface wind on the earth blowing in from north-east towards the equator, the so called trade wind. A resonable explanation is as follows : the equatorial and polar regions of the earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the earth's surface near the equator is hot while the air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is cool. In the absence of any other factor, a convection current would be set up, with the air at the equatorial surface rising and moving out towards the poles, descending and streaming in towards the equator. The rotation of the earth, however, modifies this convection current, Because of this, air close to the equator has an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it is zero close to the poles. As a result, the air descends not at the poles but at 30' N (North) latitude and returns to the equator. This is called trade wind.

#### Convection cycles

Figure 11.17: Convection cycles.

#### Radiation

Conduction and convection require some material as a transport medium. These modes of heat transfer cannot operate between bodies separated by a distance in vacuum. But the earth does receive heat from the sun across a huge distance and we quickly feel the warmth of the fire nearby even though air conducts poorly and before convection can set in. The third mechanism for heat transfer needs no medium; it is called radiation and the energy so radiated by electromagnetic waves is called radiant energy. In an electromagnetic wave electric and magnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like any wave, electromagnetic waves can have different wavelengths and can travel in vacuum with the same speed, namely the speed of light i.e., \(3\times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{\shortminusminus 1}\). You will learn these matters in more details later, but you now know why heat transfer by radiation does not need any medium and why it is so fast. This is how heat is transfered to the earth from the sun through empty space. All bodies emit radiant energy, whether they are solid, liquid or gases. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by virtue of its temperature like the radiation by a red hot iron or light from a filament lamp is called thermal radiation.

When this thermal radiation falls on other bodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed. The amount of heat that a body can absorb by radiation depends on the colour of the body.

We find that black bodies absorb and emit radiant energy better than bodies of lighter colours. This fact finds many applications in our daily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes in summer so that they absorb the least heat from the sun. However, during winter, we use dark coloured clothes which absorb heat from the sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of the utensils for cooking food are blackened so that they absorb maximum heat from the fire and give it to the vegetables to be cooked.

Similarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is a device to minimise heat transfer between the contents of the bottle and outside. It consists of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner and outer walls coated with silver. Radiation from the inner wall is reflected back into the contents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly reflects back any incoming radiation. The space between the walls is evacuated to reduce conduction and convection losses and the flask is supported on an insulator like cork. The device is, therefore, useful for preventing hot contents (like milk) from getting cold, or alternatively to store cold contents (like ice).

### Newton's law of cooling

We all know that hot water or milk when left on a table begins to cool gradually. Ultimately it attains the temperature of the surroundings. To study how a given body can cool on exchanging heat with its surroundings, let us perform the following activity.

Takesome water, say 300 ml, in a calorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with two holed lid. Fix a thermometer through a hole in the lid and make sure that the bulb of thermometer is immersed in the water. Note the reading of the thermometer. This reading \(T_{i}\) is the temperature of the surroundings. Heat the water kept in the calorimeter till it attains a temperature, say, 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C above room temperature (i.e., temperature of the surroundings). Then stop heating the water by removing the heat source. Start the stopwatch and note thereading of the thermometer after fixed interval of time, say after every one minute of stirring gently with the stirrer. Continue to note the temperature (\(T_{2}\)) of water till it attains a temperature about 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C above that of the surroundings. Then plot a graph by taking each value of temperature \(\Delta T=T_{2}-T_{1}\) along y axis and the corresponding value of \(t\) along x-axis (Fig. 18).

Figure 18: Curve showing cooling of hot water with time.

From the graph you will infer how the cooling of hot water depends on the difference of its temperature from that of the surroundings. You will also notice that initially the rate of cooling is higher and decreases as the temperature of the body falls.

The above activity shows that a hot body loses heat to its surroundings in the form of heat radiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings. Newton was the first to study, in a systematic manner, the relation between the heat lost by a body in a given enclosure and its temperature.

According to Newton's law of cooling, the rate of loss of heat, - \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{\mathcal{G}}/\mathrm{d}t\) of the body is directly proportional to the difference of temperature \(\Delta T=(T_{2}-T_{1})\) of the body and the surroundings. The law holds good only for small difference of temperature. Also, the loss of heat by radiation depends upon the nature of the surface of the body and the area of the exposed surface. We can write

\[-\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{\mathcal{G}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=k\{T_{2}\quad T_{1}\} \tag{11.15}\]

where \(k\) is a positive constant depending upon the area and nature of the surface of the body. Suppose a body of mass \(m\) and specific heat capacity \(s\) is at temperature \(T_{2}\). Let \(T_{1}\) be the temperature of the surroundings. If the temperature falls by a small amount \(\mathrm{d}T_{2}\) in time \(\mathrm{d}t\), then the amount of heat lost is

\[\mathrm{d}\mathrm{\mathcal{G}}=m\mathrm{s}\,\mathrm{d}T_{2}\]

.Rate of loss of heat is given by

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{\mathcal{G}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=m\mathrm{s}\,\frac{dT_{2} }{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{11.16}\]

From Eqs. (11.15) and (11.16) we have

\[-m\,s\,\frac{dT_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}=k\{T_{2}-T_{1}\}\]

\[\frac{dT_{2}}{T_{2}-T_{1}}=\frac{k}{m\mathrm{s}}\,dt=-\,K\,dt \tag{11.17}\]

where \(K=k/m\,s\)

On integrating,

\[\log_{e}\,(T_{2}-T_{1})=-\,K\,t+c \tag{11.18}\]

or \(T_{2}=T_{1}+C^{\prime}\) e\({}^{-\kappa}\); where \(C^{\prime}=\mathrm{e}^{c}\)

Equation (11.19) enables you to calculate the time of cooling of a body through a particular range of temperature.

For small temperature differences, the rate of cooling, due to conduction, convection, and radiation combined, is proportional to the difference in temperature. It is a valid approximation in the transfer of heat from a radiator to a room, the loss of heat through the wall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on the table.

Newton's law of cooling can be verified with the help of the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 11.19(a). The set-up consists of a double walled vessel (V) containing water in between the two walls. A copper calorimeter (C) containing hot water is placed inside the double walled vessel. Two thermometers through the corks are used to note the temperatures \(T_{2}\) of water in calorimeter and \(T_{1}\) of hot water in between the double walls respectively. Temperature of hot water in the calorimeter is noted after equal intervals of time. A graph is plotted between \(\log_{e}\,(T_{2}-T_{1})\) and time \((t)\). The nature of the graph is observed to be a straight line having a negative slope as shown in Fig. 11.19(b). This is in support of Eq. (11.18).

**Example 11.8**: A pan filled with hot food

cools from 94 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 86 \({}^{\circ}\)C in 2 minutes when

the room temperature is at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. How long

will it take to cool from 71 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 69 \({}^{\circ}\)C?

_Answer_: The average temperature of 94 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 86 \({}^{\circ}\)C is 90 \({}^{\circ}\)C, which is 70 \({}^{\circ}\)C above the room temperature. Under these conditions the pan

cools 8 \({}^{\circ}\)C in 2 minutes.

Using Eq. (11.17), we have

**Change in temperature**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:277]

where \(m\) is the mass of the substance and \(\Delta Q\) is the heat required to change its temperature by \(\Delta T\). The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by \(C\)\(\frac{1\)\(\mathcal{Q}\)\(T\) where \(\mu\) is the number of moles of the substance.
8. The latent heat of fusion (\(L\)) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance from solid into liquid at the same temperature and pressure. The latent heat of vaporisation (\(L_{y}\)) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance from liquid to the vapour state without change in the temperature and pressure.
9. The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.
10. In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through molecular collisions, without any flow of matter. For a bar of length \(L\) and uniform cross section \(A\) with its ends maintained at temperatures \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{D}\) the rate of flow of heat \(H\)is: \(H=K\)\(\frac{T_{c}-T_{D}}{L}\) where \(K\)is the thermal conductivity of the material of the bar.

Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the excess temperature of the body over the surroundings : \(\frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}t}=-k\left[T_{2}-T_{1}\right]\) Where \(T_{1}\) is the temperature of the surrounding medium and \(T_{2}\) is the temperature of the body.

**POINTS TO PODER**

1. The relation connecting Kelvin temperature (T) and the Celsius temperature \(\xi\) \[T=\xi+273.15\] and the assignment \(T=273.16\) K for the triple point of water are exact relations (by choice). With this choice, the Celsius temperature of the melting point of water and boiling point of water (both at 1 atm pressure) are very close to, but not exactly equal to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C respectively. In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points were exactly at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the preferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperature.
2. Aliquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout the system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume (i.e. density). This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.
3. Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts of the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference in some way is not heat.
4. Convection involves flow of matter _within a fluid_ due to unequal temperatures of its parts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the surface of the bar and water and not by convection within water.

3. The absolute temperature (Kelvin scale) \(T\) is related to the temperature \(\xi_{\rm c}\) on the Celsius scale by \[\xi_{\rm c}=T-273.15\] Why do we have 273.15 in this relation, and not 273.16?
4. What is the temperature of the triple-point of water on an absolute scale whose unit interval size is equal to that of the Fahrenheit scale?

## Chapter 17 Thermodynamics

### 17 Introduction

In previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of matter. In this chapter we shall study laws that govern thermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is converted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing produces the 'heat'. Conversely, in a steam engine, the 'heat' of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons, which in turn rotate the wheels of the train.

In physics, we need to define the notions of heat, temperature, work, etc. more carefully. Historically, it took a long time to arrive at the proper concept of 'heat'. Before the modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid filling in the pores of a substance. On contact between a hot body and a cold body, the fluid (called caloric) flowed from the colder to the hotter body!This is similar to what happens when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water up to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of water in the two tanks are the same. Likewise, in the 'caloric' picture of heat, heat flows until the 'caloric levels' (i.e., the temperatures) equalise.

In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in favour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin Thomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of heat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the amount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the horses employed for turning the drill) but not on the sharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this was not observed. A most natural explanation of the observations was that heat was a form of energy and the experiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form to another-from work to heat.

are equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the concept of temperature in thermodynamics? The Zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue.

### Zeroth law of thermodynamics

Imagine two systems \(A\) and \(B\), separated by an adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third system \(C\), via a conducting wall [Fig. 12.2(a)]. The states of the systems (i.e., their macroscopic variables) will change until both \(A\) and \(B\) come to thermal equilibrium with \(C\). After this is achieved, suppose that the adiabatic wall between \(A\) and \(B\) is replaced by a conducting wall and \(C\) is insulated from \(A\) and \(B\) by an adiabatic wall [Fig. 12.2(b)]. It is found that the states of \(A\) and \(B\) change no further i.e. they are found **to be in thermal equilibrium with each other**. This observation forms the basis of the **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**, which states that 'two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other'. R.H. Fowler formulated this law in 1931 long after the first and second Laws of thermodynamics were stated and so numbered.

The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two systems \(A\) and \(B\), are in thermal equilibrium, there must be a physical quantity that has the same value for both. This thermodynamic variable whose value is equal for two systems in thermal equilibrium is called temperature (\(T\)). Thus, if \(A\) and \(B\) are separately in equilibrium with \(C\), \(T_{A}=T_{C}\) and \(T_{B}=T_{C}\). This implies that \(T_{A}=T_{B}\) i.e. the systems \(A\) and \(B\) are also in thermal equilibrium.

We have arrived at the concept of temperature formally via the Zeroth Law. The next question is : how to assign numerical values to temperatures of different bodies? In other words, how do we construct a scale of temperature? Thermometry deals with this basic question to which we turn in the next section.

### Heat, internal energy and work

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to the concept of temperature that agrees with our commonsense notion. Temperature is a marker

(b) The same systems \(A\) and \(B\) separated by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall that allows heat to flow from one to another. In this case, thermal equilibrium is attained in due course.

of the 'hotness' of a body. It determines the direction of flow of heat when two bodies are placed in thermal contact. Heat flows from the body at a higher temperature to the one at lower temperature. The flowstops when the temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then in thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail how to construct temperature scales to assign temperatures to different bodies. We now describe the concepts of heat and other relevant quantities like internal energy and work.

The concept of internal energy of a system is not difficult to understand. We know that every bulk system consists of a large number of molecules. Internal energy is simply the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies of these molecules. We remarked earlier that in thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the system, as a whole, is not relevant. Internal energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies in the frame of reference relative to which the centre of mass of the system is at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered) energy associated with the random motion of molecules of the system. We denote the internal energy of a system by \(U\).

Though we have invoked the molecular picture to understand the meaning of internal energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned, \(U\)is simply a macroscopic variable of the system. The important thing about internal energy is that it depends only on the state of the system, not on how that state was achieved. Internal energy \(U\) of a system is an example of a thermodynamic'state variable' - its value depends only on the given state of the system, not on history i.e. not on the 'path' taken to arrive at that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given mass of gas depends on its state described by specific values of pressure, volume and temperature. It does not depend on how this state of the gas came about. Pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy are thermodynamic state variables of the system (gas) (see section 12.7). If we neglect the small intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies associated with various random motions of its molecules. We will see in the next chapter that in a gas this motion is not only translational (i.e. motion from one point to another in the volume of the container); it also includes rotational and vibrational motion of the molecules (Fig. 12.3).

What are the ways of changing internal energy of a system? Consider again, for simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of gas contained in a cylinder with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 12.4. Experience shows there are two ways of changing the state of the gas (and hence its internal energy). One way is to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a higher temperature than that of the gas. The temperature difference will cause a flow of energy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas, thus increasing the internal energy of the gas. The other way is to push the piston down i.e. to do work on the system, which again results in increasing the internal energy of the gas. Of course, both these things could happen in the reverse direction. With surroundings at a lower temperature, heat would flow from the gas to the surroundings. Likewise, the gas could push the piston up and do work on the surroundings. In short, heat and work are two different modes of altering the state of a thermodynamic system and changing its internal energy.

The notion of heat should be carefully distingulshed from the notion of internal energy. Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in transit. This is not just a play of words. The distinction is of basic significance. The state of a thermodynamic system is characterised by its internal energy, not heat. A statement like '**a gas in a given state has a certain amount of heat**' is as meaningless as the statement that '**a gas in a given state has a certain amount of work**'. In contrast, '**a gas in a given state has a certain amount of internal energy**' is a perfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the statements '**a certain amount of heat is supplied to the system' or 'a certain amount of work was done by the system' are perfectly meaningful.

To summarise, heat and work in thermodynamics are not state variables. They are modes of energy transfer to a system resulting in change in its internal energy, which, as already mentioned, is a state variable.

In ordinary language, we often confuse heat with internal energy. The distinction between them is sometimes ignored in elementary physics books. For proper understanding of thermodynamics, however, the distinction is crucial.

### First Law of Thermodynamics

We have seen that the internal energy \(U\) of a system can change through two modes of energy transfer : heat and work. Let

\(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) = Heat supplied to the system by the surroundings

\(\Delta W\) = Work done by the system on the surroundings

\(\Delta U\) = Change in internal energy of the system

The general principle of conservation of energy then implies that

\(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) = \(\Delta U+\Delta W\) (12.1)

i.e. the energy (\(\Delta\mathcal{G}\)) supplied to the system goes in partly to increase the internal energy of the system (\(\Delta U\)) and the rest in work on the environment (\(\Delta W\)). Equation (12.1) is known as the **First Law of Thermodynamics**. It is simply the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system in which the energy transfer from or to the surroundings is taken into account.

Let us put Eq. (12.1) in the alternative form

\[\Delta\mathcal{G}\ -\Delta W=\Delta U \tag{12.2}\]

Now, the system may go from an initial state to the final state in a number of ways. For example, to change the state of a gas from (\(P_{{}_{1}}\), \(V_{{}_{1}}\)) to (\(P_{{}_{2}}\), \(V_{{}_{2}}\)), we can first change the volume of the gas from \(V_{{}_{1}}\) to \(V_{{}_{2}}\), keeping its pressure constant i.e. we can first go the state (\(P_{{}_{1}}\), \(V_{{}_{2}}\)) and then change the pressure of the gas from \(P_{{}_{1}}\) to \(P_{{}_{2}}\), keeping volume constant, to take the gas to (\(P_{{}_{2}}\), \(V_{{}_{2}}\)). Alternatively, we can first keep the volume constant and then keep the pressure constant. Since \(U\) is a state variable, \(\Delta U\) depends only on the initial and final states and not on the path taken by the gas to go from one to the other. However, \(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) and \(\Delta W\) will, in general, depend on the path taken to go from the initial to final states. From the First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (12.2), it is clear that the combination \(\Delta\mathcal{G}-\Delta W\), is however, path independent. This shows that if a system is taken through a process in which \(\Delta U=0\) (for example, isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, see section 12.8),

\(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) = \(\Delta W\)

i.e., heat supplied to the system is used up entirely by the system in doing work on the environment.

If the system is a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston, the gas in moving the piston

Figure 12.4: Heat and work are two distinct modes of energy transfer to a system that results in change in its internal energy. (a) Heat is energy transfer due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. (b) Work is energy transfer brought about by means (e.g. moving the piston by raising or lowering some weight connected to it that do not involve such a temperature difference.

does work. Since force is pressure times area, and area times displacement is volume, work done by the system against a constant pressure \(P\) is

\[\Delta W=P\ \Delta V\]

where \(\Delta V\) is the change in volume of the gas. Thus, for this case, Eq. (12.1) gives

\[\Delta\mathcal{G}=\Delta U+P\ \Delta V \tag{12.3}\]

As an application of Eq. (12.3), consider the change in internal energy for 1 g of water when we go from its liquid to vapour phase. The measured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g, i.e., for 1 g of water \(\Delta\mathcal{G}=2256\) J. At atmospheric pressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm\({}^{3}\) in liquid phase and 1671 cm\({}^{3}\) in vapour phase.

Therefore,

\[\Delta W=P\left(V_{g}-V_{1}\right)=1.013\times 10^{5}\times(1670)\times 10^{6}= 169.2\,\mathrm{J}\]

Equation (12.3) then gives

\[\Delta U=2256-169.2\ =\ 2086.8\,\mathrm{J}\]

We see that most of the heat goes to increase the internal energy of water in transition from the liquid to the vapour phase.

### Specific Heat Capacity

Suppose an amount of heat \(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) supplied to a substance changes its temperature from \(T\) to \(T+\Delta T\). We define heat capacity of a substance (see Chapter 1.1) to be

\[S=\frac{\Delta\mathcal{G}}{\Delta T} \tag{12.4}\]

We expect \(\Delta\mathcal{G}\) and, therefore, heat capacity \(S\) to be proportional to the mass of the substance. Further, it could also depend on the temperature, i.e., a different amount of heat may be needed for a unit rise in temperature at different temperatures. To define a constant characteristic of the substance and independent of its amount, we divide \(S\) by the mass of the substance \(m\) in kg :

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \\ \mathbf{s}\end{array}\quad\frac{S}{m}\quad\frac{1}{m}\ \frac{\mathcal{G}}{T} \tag{12.5}\]

\(\mathbf{s}\) is known as the specific heat capacity of the substance. It depends on the nature of the substance and its temperature. The unit of specific heat capacity is J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

If the amount of substance is specified in terms of moles \(\mu\) (instead of mass \(m\) in kg ), we can define heat capacity per mole of the substance by

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \\ \mathbf{C}\end{array}\quad\frac{S}{m}\quad\frac{1}{T} \tag{12.6}\]

\(C\) is known as molar specific heat capacity of the substance. Like \(s\), \(C\) is independent of the amount of substance. \(C\) depends on the nature of the substance, its temperature and the conditions under which heat is supplied. The unit of \(C\) is J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\). As we shall see later (in connection with specific heat capacity of gases), additional conditions may be needed to define \(C\) or s. The idea in defining \(C\) is that simple predictions can be made in regard to molar specific heat capacities.

Table 12.1 lists measured specific and molar heat capacities of solids at atmospheric pressure and ordinary room temperature.

We will see in Chapter 13 that predictions of specific heats of gases generally agree with experiment. We can use the same law of equipartition of energy that we use there to predict molar s specific heat capacities of solids. Consider a solid of \(N\) atoms, each vibrating about its mean position. An oscillator in one dimension has average energy of \(2\times\nu_{2}\ k_{g}T\) = \(k_{g}T\). In three dimensions, the average energy is \(3\ k_{g}T\). For a mole of a solid, the total energy is

\[U=3\ k_{g}T\times N_{A}=3\ RT\]

Now, at constant pressure, \(\Delta\mathcal{G}=\Delta U+P\ \Delta V\equiv\Delta U,\) since for a solid \(\Delta V\) is negligible. Therefore,

\[C=\frac{\Delta\mathcal{G}}{\Delta T}=\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T}=3R \tag{12.7}\]

As Table 12.1 shows, the experimentally measured values which generally agrees with

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Reference** & **Description** & **Description** \\
**A** & **Description** & **Description** \\

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:289]

not be uniform throughout. Similarly, a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction (e.g. a mixture of petrol vapour and air when ignited by a spark) is not an equilibrium state; again its temperature and pressure are not uniform [Fig. 12.6(b)]. Eventually, the gas attains uniform temperature and pressure and comes to thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings.

In short, thermodynamic state variables describe equilibrium states of systems. The various state variables are not necessarily independent. The connection between the state variables is called the equation of state. For example, for an ideal gas, the equation of state is the ideal gas relation

\[P\,V=\mu\,R\,T\]

For a fixed amount of the gas i.e. given \(\mu\), there are thus, only two in dependent variables, say \(P\) and \(V\) or \(T\) and \(V\). The pressure-volume curve for a fixed temperature is called an _isothermal_. Real gases may have more complicated equations of state.

The thermodynamic state variables are of two kinds: **extensive** and **intensive**. Extensive variables indicate the'size' of the system. Intensive variables such as pressure and temperature do not. To decide which variable is extensive and which intensive, think of a relevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that it is divided into two equal parts. The variables that remain unchanged for each part are intensive. The variables whose values get halved in each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for example, that internal energy \(U\), volume \(V\), total mass \(M\) are extensive variables. Pressure \(P\), temperature \(T\), and density \(\rho\) are intensive variables. It is a good practice to check the consistency of thermodynamic equations using this classification of variables. For example, in the equation

\[\Delta\mathcal{O}=\Delta U+P\,\Delta V\]

quantities on both sides are extensive*. [The product of an intensive variable like \(P\) and an extensive quantity \(\Delta V\) is extensive.]

Footnote *: _As emphasised earlier_. \(\mathcal{O}\) _is not a state variable._ _However_. \(\Delta\mathcal{O}\) _is clearly_ _proportional to the total mass of system and hence is extensive._

### Thermodynamic Processes

#### 12.8.1 Quasi-static process

Consider a gas in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure of the gas in that case equals the external pressure and its temperature is the same as that of its surroundings. Suppose that the external pressure is suddenly reduced (say by lifting the weight on the movable piston in the container). The piston will accelerate outward. During the process, the gas passes through states that are not equilibrium states. The non-equilibrium states do not have well-defined pressure and temperature. In the same way, if a finite temperature difference exists between the gas and its surroundings, there will be a rapid exchange of heat during which the gas will pass through non-equilibrium states. In due course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium state with well-defined temperature and pressure equal to those of the surroundings. The free expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction, mentioned in section 12.7 are also examples where the system goes through non-equilibrium states.

Non-equilibrium states of a system are difficult to deal with. It is, therefore, convenient to imagine an idealised process in which at every stage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a process is, in principle, infinitely slow-hence the name quasi-static (meaning nearly static).** The system changes its variables (\(P\), \(T\), \(V\)) so slowly that it remains in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings throughout. In a quasi-static process, at every stage, the difference in the pressure of the system and the external pressure is infinitesimally small. The same is true of the temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. To take a gas from the state (\(P\), \(T\)) to another state (\(P^{\prime}\), \(T^{\prime}\)) via a quasi-static process, we change the external pressure by a very small amount, allow the system to equalise its pressure with that of the surroundings and continue the process infinitely slowly until the system achieves the pressure \(P^{\prime}\). Similarly, to change the temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal temperature difference between the system and the surrounding reservoirs and by choosing reservoirs of progressively different temperatures \(T\) to \(T^{\prime}\). the system achieves the temperature \(T^{\prime}\).

A quasi-static process is obviously a hypothetical construct. In practice, processes that are sufficiently slow and do not involve accelerated motion of the piston, large temperature gradient, etc. are reasonably approximation to an ideal quasi-static process. We shall from now on deal with quasi-static processes only, except when stated otherwise.

A process in which the temperature of the system is kept fixed throughout is called an isothermal process. The expansion of a gas in a metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of fixed temperature is an example of an isothermal process. (Heat transferred from the reservoir to the system does not materially affect the temperature of the reservoir, because of its very large heat capacity.) In _isobaric processes_ the pressure is constant while _in isochoric processes_ the volume is constant. Finally, if the system is insulated from the surroundings and no heat flows between the system and the surroundings, the process is _adiabatic_. The definitions of these special processes are summarised in Table. 12.2

We now consider these processes in some detail :

#### Isothermal process

For an isothermal process (\(T\) fixed), the ideal gas equation gives

\[PV=\mbox{constant}\]

i.e., pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely as its volume. This is nothing but Boyle's Law.

Suppose an ideal gas goes isothermally (at temperature \(T\)) from its initial state (\(P_{{}_{1}}\), \(V_{{}_{2}}\)) to the final state (\(P_{{}_{2}}\), \(V_{{}_{2}}\)). At any intermediate stage with pressure \(P\) and volume change from \(V\) to \(V+\Delta V\) (\(\Delta V\) small)

\[\Delta W=P\Delta V\]

Taking (\(\Delta V\to\)0) and summing the quantity \(\Delta W\) over the entire process,

\[\begin{array}{l}V_{{}_{2}}\\ W=V_{{}_{1}}\\ \cdot\\ =RT\frac{V_{{}_{2}}}{V}\frac{\mbox{d}V}{V}\end{array}\quad RT\ \ \ln\frac{V_{{}_{2}}}{V_{{}_{1}}} \tag{12.12}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Expected processes & Feature \\ Isothermal & Temperature constant \\ Isobaric & Pressure constant \\ Isochoric & Volume constant \\ \hline Adiabatic & No heat flow between the system and the surroundings (\(\Delta\)Q = 0) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12.2: Some special thermodynamic processes

Figure 12.7: In aquasi-static process, the temperature of the surrounding reservoir and the external pressure differ only infinitesimally from the temperature and pressure of the system

where in the second step we have made use of the ideal gas equation \(PV=\mu RT\) and taken the constants out of the integral. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. Thus, there is no change in the internal energy of an ideal gas in an isothermal process. The First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that heat supplied to the gas equals the work done by the gas : \(Q=W\). Note from Eq. (12.12) that for \(V_{2}>V_{1}\), \(W>0\); and for \(V_{2}<V_{1}\), \(W<0\). That is, in an isothermal expansion, the gas absorbs heat and does work while in an isothermal compression, work is done on the gas by the environment and heat is released.

#### Adiabatic process

In an adiabatic process, the system is insulated from the surroundings and heat absorbed or released is zero. From Eq. (12.1), we see that work done by the gas results in decrease in its internal energy (and hence its temperature for an ideal gas). We quote without proof (the result that you will learn in higher courses) that for an adiabatic process of an ideal gas.

\[PV^{\tau}=\mbox{const} \tag{133}\]

where \(\gamma\) is the ratio of specific heats (ordinary or molar) at constant pressure and at constant volume.

\[\gamma=\frac{C_{p}}{C_{v}}\]

Thus if an ideal gas undergoes a change in its state adiabatically from (\(P_{1}\), \(V_{1}\)) to (\(P_{2}\), \(V_{2}\)) :

\[P_{1}\,V_{1}^{\gamma}=P_{2}\,V_{2}^{\gamma} \tag{134}\]

Figure 8 shows the \(P\)-\(V\) curves of an ideal gas for two adiabatic processes connecting two isotherms.

We can calculate, as before, the work done in an adiabatic change of an ideal gas from the state (\(P_{1}\), \(V_{1}\), \(T_{1}\)) to the state (\(P_{2}\), \(V_{2}\), \(T_{2}\)).

\[W=P\,dV\] \[V_{1}\] \[=const\,nt\quad\frac{V_{2}}{V}\frac{dV}{V}\quad consta\,nt\quad \frac{V^{-\tau+1}}{1}\left|\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\right.\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{constant}{(1-\gamma)}\times\left[\frac{1}{V_{2}^{\gamma-1 }}-\frac{1}{V_{1}^{\gamma-1}}\right] \tag{135}\]

From Eq. (134), the constant is \(P_{1}V_{1}^{\gamma}\) or \(P_{2}V_{2}^{\gamma}\).

\[W =\frac{1}{1-}\quad\frac{P_{2}\,V_{2}}{V_{2}^{\gamma}}\quad\frac{P_ {1}V_{1}}{V_{1}^{\gamma}} \tag{136}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{1}{1-}\quad P_{2}\,V_{2}\quad P_{1}V_{1}\quad\frac{R(T_{1 }-T_{2})}{-}\]

As expected, if work is done by the gas in an adiabatic process (\(W>0\)), from Eq. (136), \(T_{2}<T_{1}\). On the other hand, if work is done on the gas (\(W<0\)), we get \(T_{2}>T_{1}\) i.e., the temperature of the gas rises.

#### Isochoric process

In an isochoric process, \(V\) is constant. No work is done on or by the gas. From Eq. (135), the heat absorbed by the gas goes entirely to change its internal energy and its temperature. The change in temperature for a given amount of heat is determined by the specific heat of the gas at constant volume.

#### Isobaric process

In an isobaric process, \(P\) is fixed. Work done by the gas is

\[W=P\,(V_{2}-V_{1})=\mu\,R\,(T_{2}-T_{2}) \tag{137}\]

Since temperature changes, so does internal energy. The heat absorbed goes partly to increase internal energy and partly to do work. The change in temperature for a given amount of heat is determined by the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure.

#### Cyclic process

In a cyclic process, the system returns to its initial state. Since internal energy is a state variable, \(\Delta U=0\) for a cyclic process. FromEq. (12.1), the total heat absorbed equals the work done by the system.

### Heat Engines

Heat engine is a device by which a system is made to undergo a cyclic process that results in conversion of heat to work.

1. It consists of a **working substance**-the system. For example, a mixture of fuel vapour and air in a gasoline or diesel engine or steam in a steam engine are the working substances.
2. The working substance goes through a cycle consisting of several processes. In some of these processes, it absorbs a total amount of heat \(Q_{1}\) from an external reservoir at some high temperature \(T_{1}\).
3. In some other processes of the cycle, the working substance releases a total amount of heat \(Q_{2}\) to an external reservoir at some lower temperature \(T_{2}\).
4. The work done (\(W\)) by the system in a cycle is transferred to the environment via some arrangement (e.g. the working substance may be in a cylinder with a moving piston that transfers mechanical energy to the wheels of a vehicle via a shaft). The basic features of a heat engine are schematically represented in Fig. 12.9.

Schematic representation of a heat engine. The engine takes heat \(Q_{1}\) from a hot reservoir at temperature \(T_{1}\), releases heat \(Q_{2}\) to a cold reservoir at temperature \(T_{2}\) and delivers work \(W\)to the surroundings.

The cycle is repeated again and again to get useful work for some purpose. The discipline of thermodynamics has its roots in the study of heat engines. A basic question relates to the efficiency of a heat engine. The efficiency (\(\eta\) of a heat engine is defined by

\[\cdot\]

\[\eta=\frac{W}{Q_{1}} \tag{12.18}\]

where \(Q_{1}\) is the heat input i.e., the heat absorbed by the system in one complete cycle and \(W\) is the work done on the environment in a cycle. In a cycle, a certain amount of heat (\(Q_{2}\)) may also be rejected to the environment. Then, according to the First Law of Thermodynamics, over one complete cycle,

\[W=Q_{1}-Q_{2} \tag{12.19}\]

i.e.,

\[\eta=1-\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} \tag{12.20}\]

For \(Q_{2}=0\), \(\eta=1\), i.e., the engine will have 100% efficiency in converting heat into work. Note that the First Law of Thermodynamics i.e., the energy conservation law does not rule out such an engine. But experience shows that such an ideal engine with \(\eta=1\) is never possible, even if we can eliminate various kinds of losses associated with actual heat engines. It turns out that there is a fundamental limit on the efficiency of a heat engine set by an independent principle of nature, called the Second Law of Thermodynamics (section 12.11).

The mechanism of conversion of heat into work varies for different heat engines. Basically, there are two ways : the system (say a gas or a mixture of gases) is heated by an external furnace, as in a steam engine; or it is heated internally by an exothermic chemical reaction as in an internal combustion engine. The various steps involved in a cycle also differ from one engine to another. For the purpose of general analysis, it is useful to conceptualise a heat engine as having the following essential ingredients.

### Refrigerators and Heat Pumps

A refrigerator is the reverse of a heat engine. Here the working substance extracts heat \(Q_{2}\) from the cold reservoir at temperature \(T_{2}\), some external work \(W\) is done on it and heat \(Q_{1}\) is released to the hot reservoir at temperature \(T_{1}\) (Fig. 12.10).

**Pioneers ofThermodynamics**

**Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) (1824-1907), born in Belfast, Ireland, is among the foremost British scientists of the nineteenth century. Thomson played a key role in the development of the law of conservation of energy suggested by the work of James Joule [1818-1889], Julius Mayer [1814-1878] and Hermann Helmholtz [1821-1894]. He collaborated with Joule on the so-called Joule-Thomson effect : cooling of a gas when it expands into vacuum. He introduced the notion of the absolute zero of temperature and proposed the absolute temperature scale, now called the Kelvin scale in his honour. From the work of Sadi Carnot [1796-1832], Thomson arrived at a form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Thomson was a versatile physicist, with notable contributions to electromagnetic theory and hydrodynamics.**

**Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888), born in Poland, is generally regarded as the discoverer of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Based on the work of Carnot and Thomson, Clausius arrived at the important notion of entropy that led him to a fundamental version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that states that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. Clausius also worked on the kinetic theory of gases and obtained the first reliable estimates of molecular size, speed, mean free path, etc.**

**where** \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\) **is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir and** \(W\) **is the work done on the system-the refrigerant. (**\(\alpha\) **for heat pump is defined as** \(\mathcal{G}_{1}/W\)**) Note that while** \(\eta\)**by definition can never exceed** \(1\)**,** \(\alpha\) **can be greater than** \(1\)**. By energy conservation, the heat released to the hot reservoir is**

\[\mathcal{G}_{1}=W+\mathcal{G}_{2}\] \[\cdot \tag{12.22}\]

**i.e.,** \[\mathcal{G}_{2}\over\mathcal{G}_{1}-\mathcal{G}_{2}\] (12.22)

**In a heat engine, heat cannot be fully converted to work; likewise a refrigerator cannot work without some external work done on the system, i.e., the coefficient of performance in Eq. (12.21) cannot be infinite.**

**12.11 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS**

**The First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle of conservation of energy. Common experience shows that there are many conceivable processes that are perfectly allowed by the First Law and yet are never observed. For example, nobody has ever seen a book lying on a table jumping to a height by itself. But such a thingwould be possible if the principle ofconservation of energy were the only restriction. The table could coolsontaneously, converting some of its internal energy into an equal amount of mechanical energy of the book, which would then hop to a height with potential energy equal to the mechanical energy it acquired. But this never happens. Clearly, some additional basic principle of nature forbids the above, even though it satisfies the energy conservation principle. This principle, which disallows many phenomena consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat engine and the co-efficient of performance of a refrigerator. In simple terms, it says that efficiency of a heat engine can never be unity. According to Eq. (12.20), this implies that heat released to the cold reservoir can never be made zero. For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that the co-efficient of performance can never be infinite. According to Eq. (12.21), this implies that external work (\(W\)) can never be zero. The following two statements, one due to Kelvin and Planck denying the possibility of a perfect heat engine, and another due to Clausius denying the possibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat pump, are a concise summary of these observations.

#### Second Law of Thermodynamics

##### Kelvin-Planck statement

No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the complete conversion of the heat into work.

##### Clausius statement

No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter object.

It can be proved that the two statements above are completely equivalent.

##### 12.12 Reversible and irreversible processes

Imagine some process in which a thermodynamic system goes from an initial state \(i\) to a final state \(f\). During the process the system absorbs heat \(Q\) from the surroundings and performs work \(W\) on it. Can we reverse this process and bring both the system and surroundings to their initial states with no other effect anywhere? Experience suggests that for most processes in nature this is not possible. The spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. Several examples can be cited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter than its other parts. When the vessel is removed, heat is transferred from the base to the other parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform temperature (which in due course cools to the temperature of the surroundings). The process cannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base. It will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, if it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible. The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed. Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse and bring the gas back to the cylinder. The stirring of a liquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will convert the work done into heat, increasing the internal energy of the reservoir. The process cannot be reversed exactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion of heat entirely into work, violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Irreversibility is a rule rather an exception in nature.

Irreversibility arises mainly from two causes: one, many processes (like a free expansion, or an explosive chemical reaction) take the system to non-equilibrium states; two, most processes involve friction, viscosity and other dissipative effects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and losing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor and the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming to a stop due to viscosity and losing its mechanical energy with corresponding gain in the internal energy of the liquid). Since dissipative effects are present everywhere and can be minimised but not fully eliminated, most processes that we deal with are irreversible.

A thermodynamic process (state \(i\) -state\(f\) ) is reversible if the process can be turned back such that both the system and the surroundings return to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. From the preceding discussion, a reversible process is an idealised notion. A process is reversible only if it is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the surroundings at every stage) and there are no dissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process.

Why is reversibility such a basic concept in thermodynamics? As we have seen, one of the concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency with which heat can be converted into work. The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100% efficiency. But what is the highest efficiency possible for a heat engine working between two reservoirs at temperatures \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\)? It turns out that a heat engine based on idealised reversible processes achieves the highest efficiency possible. All other engines involving irreversibility in any way (as would be the case for practical engines) have lower than this limiting efficiency.

#### Carnot Engine

Suppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature \(T_{1}\) and a cold reservoir at temperature \(T_{2}\). What is the maximum efficiency possible for a heat engine operating between the two reservoirs and what cycle of processes should be adopted to achieve the maximum efficiency? Sadi Carnot, a French engineer, first considered this question in 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the correct answer, even though the basic concepts of heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly established.

We expect the ideal engine operating between two temperatures to be a reversible engine. Irreversibility is associated with dissipative effects, as remarked in the preceding section, and lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if it is quasi-static and non-dissipative. We have seen that a process is not quasi-static if it involves finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir. This implies that in a reversible heat engine operating between two temperatures, heat should be absorbed (from the hot reservoir) isothermally and released (to the cold reservoir) isothermally. We thus have identified two steps of the reversible heat engine : isothermal process at temperature \(T_{1}\) absorbing heat \(Q_{1}\) from the hot reservoir, and another isothermal process at temperature \(T_{2}\) releasing heat \(Q_{2}\) to the cold reservoir. To complete a cycle, we need to take the system from temperature \(T_{1}\) to \(T_{2}\) and then back from temperature \(T_{2}\) to \(T_{1}\). Which processes should we employ for this purpose that are reversible? A little reflection shows that we can only adopt reversible adiabatic processes for these purposes, which involve no heat flow from any reservoir. If we employ any other process that is not adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take the system from one temperature to another, we shall need a series of reservoirs in the temperature range \(T_{2}\) to \(T_{1}\) to ensure that at each stage the process is quasi-static. (Remember again that for a process to be quasi-static and reversible, there should be no finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir.) But we are considering a reversible engine that operates between only two temperatures. Thus adiabatic processes must bring about the temperature change in the system from \(T_{1}\) to \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{2}\) to \(T_{1}\) in this engine.

A reversible heat engine operating between two temperatures is called a Carnot engine. We have just argued that such an engine must have the following sequence of steps constituting one cycle, called the Carnot cycle, shown in Fig. 12.11. We have taken the working substance of the Carnot engine to be an ideal gas.

11. In a refrigerator or a heat pump, the system extracts heat \(Q_{2}\) from the cold reservoir and releases \(Q_{1}\), amount of heat to the hot reservoir. with work \(W\) done on the system. The co-efficient of performance of a refrigerator is given by \[\alpha=\frac{Q_{2}}{W}=\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}-Q_{2}}\]
12. The second law of thermodynamics disallows some processes consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics. It states _Kelvin-Planck statement_ No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and complete conversion of the heat into work. _Causius statement_ No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter object. Put simply. the Second Law implies that no heat engine can have efficiency \(n\)equal to \(1\) or no refrigerator can have co-efficient of performance \(\alpha\) equal to infinity.
13. A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings return to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. Spontaneous us processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a quasi-static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.
14. Carnot engine is a reversible engine operating between two temperatures \(T_{1}\) (source] and \(T_{2}\) (sink). The Carnot cycle consists of two isothermal processes connected by two adiabatic processes. The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by \[\eta=1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\qquad\qquad\{\text{Carnot engine}\}\] No engine operating between two temperatures can have efficiency greater than that of the Carnot engine.

**POINTS TO PODER**

1. Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energy, not to the kinetic energy of motion of its centre of mass. A bullet fired from a gun is not at a higher temperature because of its high speed.
2. Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables describing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time. Equilibrium of a system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero.
3. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are not in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics).
4. Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is supplied.
5. In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even though at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding reservoir. This is possible because of the infinitesimal difference in temperature between the system and the reservoir.

## Chapter 13 Kinetic Theory

### 13.1 Introduction

Boyle discovered the law named after him in 1661. Boyle, Newton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of gases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic particles. The actual atomic theory got established more than 150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces, which are short range forces that are important for solids and liquids. can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory was developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell. Boltzmann and others. It has been remarkably successful. It gives a molecular interpretation of pressure and temperature of a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro's hypothesis. It correctly explains specific heat capacities of many gases. It also relates measurable properties of gases such as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses. This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.

### 13.2 Molecular Nature of Matter

Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century considers the discovery that "Matter is made up of atoms" to be a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation (due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to environmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that happens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed then Feynman would like the 'Atomic Hypothesis' to be communicated to the next generation of creatures in the universe. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

Speculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in many places and cultures. Kanada in India and Democritus

### Atomic Hypothesis in AncientIndia and Greece

Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules. In the Vaiesshika school of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter. It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a mustard seed and the Meru mountain. The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu -- Sanskrit word for the smallest particle) postulated were Bhooml [Earth], Ap [water], Teas (fire) and Vayu [air] that have characteristic mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule dyvanuka, three atoms form a trypanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms. The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture or by methods that are not known to us. The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic size, of the order of \(10^{-10}\)m.

In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The word 'atom' means 'indivisible' in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in shape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed by their combination. The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to 'hook' on to each other, which is why liquid /water flows easily. The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held together to form hard substances. The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns. These fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further, perhaps because they were intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the hallmark of modern science.

In Greece had suggested that matter may consist of indivisible constituents. The scientific 'Atomic Theory' is usually credited to John Dalton. He proposed the atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions obeyed by elements when they combine into compounds. The first law says that any given compound has, a fixed proportion by mass of its constituents. The second law says that when two elements form more than one compound, for a fixed mass of one element, the masses of the other elements are in ratio of small integers.

To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about 200 years ago, that the smallest constituents of an element are atoms. Atoms of one element are identical but differ from those of other elements. A small number of atoms of each element combine to form a molecule of the compound. Gay Lussac's law, also given in early \(19^{\text{th}}\) century, states: When gases combine chemically to yield another gas, their volumes are in the ratios of small integers. Avogadro's law (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules. Avogadro's law, when combined with Dalton's theory explains Gay Lussac's law. Since the elements are often in the form of molecules, Dalton's atomic theory can also be referred to as the molecular theory of matter. The theory is now well accepted by scientists. However even at the end of the nineteenth century there were famous scientists who did not believe in atomic theory!

From many observations, in recent times we now know that molecules (made up of one or more atoms) constitute matter. Electron microscopes and scanning tunnelling microscopes enable us to even see them. The size of an atom is about an angstrom (\(10\cdot 10\) m). In solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are spaced about a few angstroms {2 A} apart. In liquids the separation between atoms is also about the same. In liquids the atoms are not as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move around. This enables a liquid to flow. In gases the interatomic distances are in tens of angstroms. The average distance a molecule can travel without colliding is called the **mean free path**. The mean free path, in gases, is of the order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms are much freer in gases and can travel long distances without colliding. If they are not enclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and liquids the closeness makes the interatomic force important. The force has a long range attraction and a short range repulsion. The atoms attract when they are at a few angstroms but repel when they come closer. The static appearance of a gasis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the equilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic equilibrium, molecules collide and change their speeds during the collision. Only the average properties are constant.

Atomic theory is not the end of our quest, but the beginning. We now know that atoms are not indivisible or elementary. They consist of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made up of protons and neutrons. The protons and neutrons are again made up of quarks. Even quarks may not be the end of the story. There may be string like elementary entities. Nature always has surprises for us, but the search for truth is often enjoyable and the discoveries beautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves to understanding the behaviour of gases (and a little bit of solids), as a collection of moving molecules in incessant motion.

### BEHAVIOUR OF GASES

Properties of gases are easier to understand than those of solids and liquids. This is mainly because in a gas, molecules are far from each other and their mutual interactions are negligible except when two molecules collide. Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquefy (or solidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation between their pressure, temperature and volume given by (see Ch. 11)

_PV = KT_ (13.1)

for a given sample of the gas. Here \(T\) is the temperature in kelvin or (absolute) scale. \(K\) is a constant for the given sample but varies with the volume of the gas. If we now bring in the idea of atoms or molecules then \(K\) is proportional to the number of molecules, (say) \(N\) in the sample. We can write \(K\) = _Nk_. Observation tells us that this \(k\) is same for all gases. It is called Boltzmann constant and is denoted by \(k_{{}_{B}}\).

As \(\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{N_{1}T_{1}}\)\(\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{N_{2}T_{2}}\) = constant = \(k_{{}_{B}}\) (13.2)

if \(P\), \(V\) and \(T\) are same, then \(N\) is also same for all gases. This is Avogadro's hypothesis, that the number of molecules per unit volume is same for all gases at a fixed temperature and pressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gas is 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\). This is known as Avogadro number and is denoted by \(N_{{}_{A}}\). The mass of 22.4 litres of any gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams at S.T.P(standard temperature 273 K and pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is called a mole (see Chapter 2 for a more precise definition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of numbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed temperature and pressure from chemical reactions. Kinetic theory justifies this hypothesis.

The perfect gas equation can be written as

_PV = \(\mu\) RT_ (13.3)

where \(\mu\) is the number of moles and \(R\) = \(N_{{}_{A}}\)\(k_{{}_{B}}\) is a universal constant. The temperature _Ti_ is absolute temperature. Choosing kelvin scale for 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:306]

We next consider some examples which give us information about the volume occupied by the molecules and the volume of a single molecule.

The density of water is 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\). The density of water vapour at 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 1 atm pressure is 0.6 kg m\({}^{-3}\). The volume of a molecule multiplied by the total number gives,what is called, molecular volume. Estimate the ratio (or fraction) of the molecular volume to the total volume occupied by the water vapour under the above conditions of temperature and pressure.

_Answer_ For a given mass of water molecules, the density is less if volume is large. So the volume of the vapour is 1000/0.6 =/(6 x10 - 4) times larger. If densities of bulk water and water molecules are same, then the fraction of molecular volume to the total volume in liquid state is 1. As volume in vapour state has increased, the fractional volume is less by the same amount, i.e. 6x10\({}^{+}\).

Estimate the volume of a water molecule using the data in Example 13.1.

_Answer_ In the liquid (or solid) phase, the molecules of water are quite closely packed. The density of water molecule may therefore, be regarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk water = 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\). To estimate the volume of a water molecule, we need to know the mass of a single water molecule. We know that 1 mole of water has a mass approximately equal to

\([2+16]\)g = 18 g = 0.018 kg.

Since 1 mole contains about \(6\times 10^{23}\) molecules (Avogadro's number), the mass of a molecule of water is \(\{0.018\}/(6\times 10^{23})\) kg = \(3\times 10^{-26}\) kg. Therefore, a rough estimate of the volume of a water molecule is as follows :

Volume of a water molecule

= \(\{3\times 10^{-28}\) kg/ (1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\))

= \(3\times 10^{-29}\) m\({}^{3}\)

= \(\{4/3\}\)\(\pi\) [Radius]\({}^{3}\)

Hence, Radius = 2 x10\({}^{-10}\) m = 2 A

What is the average distance between atoms (interatomic distance) in water? Use the data given in Examples 13.1 and 13.2.

_Answer_ : A given mass of water in vapour state has 1.67x10\({}^{3}\) times the volume of the same mass of water in liquid state (Ex. 13.1). This is also the increase in the amount of volume available for each molecule of water. When volume increases by \(10^{3}\) times the radius increases by \(V^{1/3}\) or 10 times, i.e., 10 x 2 A = 20 A. So the average distance is 2 x 20 = 40 A.

A vessel contains two non-reactive gases : neon (monatomic) and oxygen (diatomic). The ratio of their partial pressures is 3:2. Estimate the ratio of (l) number of molecules and (ll) mass density of neon and oxygen in the vessel. Atomic mass of Ne = 20.2 u, molecular mass of O\({}_{2}\) = 32.0 u.

_Answer_ Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is the pressure it would have for the same volume and temperature if it alone occupied the vessel. (The total pressure of a mixture of non-reactive gases is the sum of partial pressures due to its constituent gases.) Each gas (assumed ideal) obeys the gas law. Since \(V\)and \(T\) are common to the two gases, we have \(P_{1}V\)= \(\mu_{1}RT\) and \(P_{2}V\)= \(\mu_{2}RT\), i.e. (\(P_{1}/P_{2}\))= \(\{\mu_{1}\)/ \(\mu_{2}\)}. Here 1 and 2 refer to neon and oxygen respectively. Since (\(P_{1}/P_{2}\)) = \(\{3/2\}\) (given), \(\{\mu_{1}\)/ \(\mu_{2}\)} = \(3/2\).

1. By definition \(\mu_{{}_{1}}=(N_{{}_{1}}/N_{{}_{A}})\) and \(\mu_{{}_{2}}=(N_{{}_{2}}/N_{{}_{A}})\) where \(N_{{}_{1}}\) and \(N_{{}_{2}}\) are the number of molecules of 1 and 2, and \(N_{{}_{A}}\) is the Avogadro's number. Therefore, \((N_{{}_{1}}/N_{{}_{2}})=\{\mu_{{}_{1}}/\mu_{{}_{2}}\}=3/2\).
2. We can also write \(\mu_{{}_{1}}=(m_{{}_{1}}/M_{{}_{1}})\) and \(\mu_{{}_{2}}=(m_{{}_{2}}/M_{{}_{2}})\) where \(m_{{}_{1}}\) and \(m_{{}_{2}}\) are the masses of 1 and 2; and \(M_{{}_{1}}\) and \(M_{{}_{2}}\) are their molecular masses. (Both \(m_{{}_{1}}\) and \(M_{{}_{1}}\); as well as \(m_{{}_{2}}\) and \(M_{{}_{2}}\) should be expressed in the same units). If \(\rho_{{}_{1}}\) and \(\rho_{{}_{2}}\) are the mass densities of 1 and 2 respectively. we have..

### Kinetic Theory of An Ideal Gas

Kinetic theory of gases is based on the molecular arpicture of matter. A given amount of gas is a collection of a large number of molecules (typically of the order of Avogadro's number) that are in incessant random motion. At ordinary pressure and temperature, the average distance between molecules is a factor of 10 or more than the typical size of a molecule (2 A). Thus the interaction between the molecules is negligible and we can assume that they move freely in straight lines according to Newton's first law. However, occasionally, they come close to each other, experience intermolecular forces and their velocities change. These interactions are called collisions. The molecules collide incessantly against each other or with the walls and change their velocities. The collisions are considered to be elastic. We can derive an expression for the pressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.

We begin with the idea that molecules of a gas are in incessant random motion, colliding against one another and with the walls of the container. All collisions between molecules among themselves or between molecules and the walls are elastic. This implies that total kinetic energy is conserved. The total momentum is conserved as usual.

#### Pressure of an Ideal Gas

Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side 1. Take the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube, as shown in Fig. 13.4. A molecule with velocity \((v_{x^{\prime}}\,v_{y^{\prime}}\,v_{z}\,)\) hits the planar wall parallel to \(yz\)-plane of area \(A\) (\(=l^{2}\)). Since the collision is elastic, the molecule rebounds with the same velocity; its \(y\) and z components of velocity do not change in the collision but the \(x\)-component reverses sign. That is, the velocity after collision is \((-v_{x^{\prime}}\,v_{y^{\prime}}\,v_{z}\,)\). The change in momentum of the molecule is : \(-mv_{x}-(mv_{x})=-2\,mv_{x}\,\). By the principle of conservation of momentum, the momentum imparted to the wall in the collision = \(2\,mv_{x}\,\).

To calculate the force (and pressure) on the wall, we need to calculate momentum imparted to the wall per unit time. In a small time interval \(\Delta t\), a molecule with \(x\)-component of velocity \(v_{x}\) will hit the wall if it is within the distance \(v_{x}\,\Delta t\) from the wall. That is, all molecules within the volume \(Av_{x}\Delta t\) only can hit the wall in time \(\Delta t\). But, on the average, half of these are moving towards the wall and the other half away from the wall. Thus the number of molecules with velocity \((v_{x^{\prime}}\,v_{y^{\prime}}\,v_{z}\,)\) hitting the wall in time \(\Delta t\) is \(\%A\,\,v_{x}\,\Delta t\) where \(n\) is the number of molecules per unit volume. The total momentum transferred to the wall by these molecules in time \(\Delta t\) is :

\(\underline{\partial}=(2\,mv_{x}\,)\,(\%\,\,n\,A\,\,v_{x}\,\Delta t\,)\) (13.10)

The force on the wall is the rate of momentum transfer \(\underline{\partial}/\Delta t\) and pressure is force per unit area :

\(P=\underline{\partial}\,/(A\,\Delta t)=n\,m\,v_{x}^{2}\) (3.11)

Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have the same velocity; there is a distribution in velocities. The above equation therefore, stands for pressure due to the group of molecules with speed \(v_{x}\,\) in the \(x\)-direction and n stands for the number density of that group of molecules. The

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:309]

\(PV=(2/3)Nx\)\(\nu_{2}\)\(\dot{\overline{v^{2}}}\) (13.15b) where \(N\) (\(=nV\)) is the number of molecules in the sample.

The quantity in the bracket is the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules in the gas. Since the internal energy \(E\) of an ideal gas is purely kinetic1,

Footnote 1: \(E\) denotes the translational part of the internal energy \(U\) that may include energies due to other degrees of freedom also. See section 13.5.

\(E=N\times(1/2)m\)\(\overline{v^{2}}\) (13.16)

Equation (13.15) then gives :

\(PV=(2/3)E\) (13.17)

We are now ready for a kinetic interpretation of temperature. Combining Eq. (13.17) with the ideal gas Eq. (13.3), we get

\(E=(3/2)k_{{}_{B}}NT\) (13.18) or \(E/N=\nu_{2}\)\(m\)\(\overline{v^{2}}=(3/2)k_{{}_{B}}T\) (13.19) i.e., the average kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas; it is independent of pressure, volume or the nature of the ideal gas. This is a fundamental result relating temperature, a macroscopic measurable parameter of a gas (a thermodynamic variable as it is called) to a molecular quantity, namely the average kinetic energy of a molecule. The two domains are connected by the Boltzmann constant. We note in passing that Eq. (13.18) tells us that internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, not on pressure or volume. With this interpretation of temperature, kinetic theory of an ideal gas is completely consistent with the ideal gas equation and the various gas laws based on it.

For a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the total pressure gets contribution from each gas in the mixture. Equation (13.14) becomes

\(P=(1/3)[n_{{}_{1}}m_{{}_{1}}\overline{v_{{}_{1}}^{2}}+n_{{}_{2}}m_{{}_{2}} \overline{v_{{}_{2}}^{2}}+...]\) (13.20)

In equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of the molecules of different gases will be equal. That is,

\(\nu_{2}\)\(m_{{}_{1}}\)\(\overline{v_{{}_{1}}^{2}}=\nu_{2}\)\(m_{{}_{2}}\)\(\overline{v_{{}_{2}}^{2}}=(3/2)k_{{}_{B}}T\)

so that

\(P=(n_{{}_{1}}+n_{{}_{2}}+...)k_{{}_{B}}T\) (13.21)

which is Dalton's law of partial pressures.

From Eq. (13.19), we can get an idea of the typical speed of molecules in a gas. At a temperature \(T=300\) K, the mean square speed of a molecule in nitrogen gas is :

\(m\)\(\overline{M_{{}_{N_{2}}}}\)\(\overline{N_{{}_{A}}}\)\(\overline{6.02}\)\(\overline{10^{26}}\)\(\overline{4.65}\)\(\overline{10^{-26}}\) kg.

\(\overline{v^{2}}=3k_{{}_{B}}T/m\)\(\overline{v^{2}}=(516)^{2}m^{2}s^{2}\)

The square root of \(\overline{v^{2}}\) is known as root mean square (rms) speed and is denoted by \(v_{\rm rms}\),

(We can also write \(\overline{v^{2}}\) as \(<v^{2}>\).)

\(v_{\rm rms}=516\) m s-1

The speed is of the order of the speed of sound in air. It follows from Eq. (13.19) that at the same temperature, lighter molecules have greater rms speed.

Example 13.5: A flask contains argon and chlorine in the ratio of 2:1 by mass. The temperature of the mixture is 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Obtain the ratio of (i) average kinetic energy per molecule, and (ii) root mean square speed \(v_{\rm rms}\) of the molecules of the two gases. Atomic mass of argon = 39.9 u; Molecular mass of chlorine = 70.9 u.

Answer: The important point to remember is that the average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any (ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic like chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to (3/2) \(k_{{}_{B}}T\). It depends only on temperature, and is independent of the nature of the gas.

(i) Since argon and chlorine both have the same temperature in the flask, the ratio of average kinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases is 1:1.

(ii) Now \(\nu_{2}\)\(m\)\(\overline{v_{{}_{\rm rms}}}^{2}=\nu_{2}\)\(\overline{v_{{}_{\rm rms}}}^{2}=(3/2)k_{{}_{B}}T\) where \(m\) is the mass of a molecule of the gas. Therefore,

\(\overline{\overline{v_{{}_{\rm rms}}}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}_{}_{}_{{}_{}_{{}}_{{}_{}_

**Maxwell Distribution Function**

In a given mass of gas, the velocities of all molecules are not the same, even when bulk parameters like pressure, volume and temperature are fixed. Collisions change the direction and the speed of molecules. However in a state of equilibrium, the distribution of speeds is constant or fixed.

Distributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large number of objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not feasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children up to age 20 years, adults between ages of 20 and 60, old people above 60. If we want more detailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0-1, 1-2,..., 99-100 of age groups. When the size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval will also reduce, roughly half the original number in the one year interval. The number of persons \(\mathrm{d}N[x]\) in the age interval \(x\) and \(x+\mathrm{d}x\) is proportional to \(\mathrm{d}x\) or \(\mathrm{d}N[x]=n_{x}\mathrm{d}x\). We have used \(n_{x}\) to denote the number of persons at the value of \(x\).

In a similar way the molecular speed distribution gives the number of molecules between the speeds \(v\) and \(v+\mathrm{d}v\), \(\mathrm{d}N[v]=4\,p\,N\,a^{3}e^{\mathrm{d}v^{2}}\,v^{3}\,\mathrm{d}v=n_{x} \mathrm{d}v\). This is called Maxwell distribution. The plot of \(n_{v}\) against \(v\) is shown in the figure. The fraction of the molecules with speeds \(v\) and \(v+\mathrm{d}v\) is equal to the area of the strip shown. The average of any quantity like \(v^{2}\) is defined by the integral \(<\!\!v^{2}\!>\,(1/N)\,\)\(\mid\,v^{2}\,\mathrm{d}N[v]=\hat{\mathbb{A}}(3k_{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{     \mathrm{      }}}}}}}}}}}}} \ \mathrm{T/m)\) which agrees with the result derived from more elementary considerations.

**calculation. Any other proportion by mass of argon and chlorine would give the same answers to (i) and (ii), provided the temperature remains unaltered.**

**Example 13.6**: Uranium has two isotopes of masses 235 and 238 units. If both are presentin Uranium hexafluoride gas which would have the larger average speed? If atomic mass of fluorine is 19 units, estimate the percentage difference in speeds at any temperature.

_Answer_ **At a fixed temperature the average energy = \(\!\!\!V_{2}\,m<\!\!v^{2}\!>\,\) is constant. So smaller the mass of the molecule, faster will be the speed. The ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of the masses. The masses are 349 and 352 units. So \(v_{349}\)\(/\)\(v_{352}\)\(=\)\(\{\)\(352/\)\(349\)\(\}^{1/2}\)\(=\)\(1.0044\). Hence difference \(\frac{V}{V}=0.44\,\%\).**

**[**\({}^{235}\)U is the isotope needed for nuclear fission. To separate it from the more abundant isotope \({}^{238}\)U, the mixture is surrounded by a porous cylinder. The porous cylinder must be thick and narrow, so that the molecule wanders through individually, colliding with the walls of the long pore. The faster molecule will leak out more thanthe slower one and so there is more of the lighter molecule (enrichment) outside the porous cylinder (Fig. 13.5). The method is not very efficient and has to be repeated several times for sufficient enrichment.]. \(\blacktriangle\)

When gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to square root of the masses (see Exercise 13.12 ). Can you guess the explanation from the above answer?

**Example 13.7**: (a) When a molecule (or an elastic ball) hits a ( massive) wall, it rebounds with the same speed. When a ball hits a massive bat held firmly, the same thing happens. However, when the bat is moving towards the ball, the ball rebounds with a different speed. Does the ball move faster or slower? (Ch.6 will refresh your memory on elastic collisions.)

(b) When gas in a cylinder is compressed by pushing in a piston, its temperature rises. Guess at an explanation of this in terms of kinetic theory using (a) above.

(c) What happens when a compressed gas pushes a piston out and expands. What would you observe?

(d) Sachin Tendulkar uses a heavy cricket bat while playing. Does it help him in anyway?

**Answer (a) Let the speed of the ball be \(u\) relative to the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving towards the ball with a speed \(V\) relative to the wicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat is \(V+u\) towards the bat. When the ball rebounds (after hitting the massive bat) its speed, relative to bat, is \(V+u\) moving away from the bat. So relative to the wicket the speed of the rebound ball is \(V+(V+u)=2V+u\), moving away from the wicket. So the ball speeds up after the collision with the bat. The rebound speed will be less than \(u\) if the bat is not massive. For a molecule this would imply an increase in temperature.**

You should be able to answer (b) (c) and (d) based on the answer to (a).

**13.5 LAW OF EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY**

The kinetic energy of a single molecule is

\[\cdot\quad\quad\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^{2}\quad\frac{1}{2}mv_{y}^{2}\quad\frac{1}{2} mv_{x}^{2} \tag{13.22}\]

For a gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature \(T\) the average value of energy denoted by \(\cdot\)\(\cdot\)\(\cdot\) is

\[\cdot\quad\quad\left(\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^{2}\right)\quad\frac{1}{2}mv_{y}^{2} \quad\left(\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^{2}\right)\quad\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T \tag{13.23}\]

Since there is no preferred direction, Eq. (13.23) implies

\[\cdot\quad\quad\left(\frac{1}{2}\ mv_{x}^{2}\right)\quad\quad\frac{1}{2}\ k_{B}T\quad\cdot\quad\left(\frac{1}{2}\ mv_{y}^{2}\right)\quad\quad\frac{1}{2}\ k_{B}T\;. \tag{13.24}\]

A molecule free to move in space needs three coordinates to specify its location. If it is constrained to move in a plane it needs two;and if constrained to move along a line, it needs just one coordinate to locate it. This can also be expressed in another way. We say that it has one degree of freedom for motion in a line, two for motion in a plane and three for motion in space. Motion of a body as a whole from one point to another is called translation. Thus, a molecule free to move in space has three translational degrees of freedom. Each translational degree of freedom contributes a term that contains square of some variable of motion, e.g., \(\forall\omega\ mv_{x}^{2}\) and similar terms in \(v_{y}\) and \(v_{z}\). In, Eq. (13.24) we see that in thermal equilibrium, the average of each such term is \(\forall\omega\ k_{B}T\).

Figure 13.5: Molecules going through a porous wall.

Molecules of a monatomic gas like argon have only translational degrees of freedom. But what about a diatomic gas such as O\({}_{2}\) or N\({}_{2}\)? A molecule of O\({}_{2}\) has three translational degrees of freedom. But in addition it can also rotate about its centre of mass. Figure 13.6 shows the two independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal to the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about which the molecule can rotate1. The molecule thus has two rotational degrees of freedom, each of which contributes a term to the total energy consisting of translational energy \({}_{{}_{\ell}}\) and rotational energy \({}_{{}_{\ell}}\).

Footnote 1: Rotation along the line joining the atoms has very small moment of inertia and does not come into play for quantum mechanical reasons. See end of section 13.6.

(13.25)

where \(\alpha\) and \(\omega_{2}\) are the angular speeds about the axes 1 and 2 and \(I_{1}\), \(I_{2}\) are the corresponding moments of inertia. Note that each rotational degree of freedom contributes a term to the energy that contains square of a rotational variable of motion.

We have assumed above that the O, molecule is a 'rigid rotator', i.e. the molecule does not vibrate. This assumption, though found to be true (at moderate temperatures) for O\({}_{2}\), is not always valid. Molecules like CO even at moderate temperatures have a mode of vibration, i.e. its atoms oscillate along the interatomic axis like a one-dimensional oscillator, and contribute a vibrational energy term \(\varepsilon_{{}_{v}}\) to the total energy:

(13.26)

where k is the force constant of the oscillator and y the vibrational co-ordinate.

Once again the vibrational energy terms in Eq. (13.26) contain squared terms of vibrational variables of motion \(y\) and \(\mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}t\).

At this point, notice an important feature in Eq.(13.26). While each translational and rotational degree of freedom has contributed only one'squared term' in Eq.(13.26), one vibrational mode contributes two'squared terms' : kinetic and potential energies.

Each quadratic term occurring in the expression for energy is a mode of absorption of energy by the molecule. We have seen that in thermal equilibrium at ab solute temperature T, for each translational mode of motion, the average energy is \(\forall\lambda\,k_{{}_{B}}T\). A most elegant principle of classical statistical mechanics (first proved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each mode of energy: translational, rotational and vibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total energy is equally distributed in all possible energy modes, with each mode having an average energy equal to \(\forall\lambda\,k_{{}_{B}}T\). This is known as the law of equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each translational and rotational degree of freedom of a molecule contributes \(\forall\lambda\,k_{{}_{B}}T\) to the energy while each vibrational frequency contributes \(2\times\forall\lambda\,k_{{}_{B}}T=k_{{}_{B}}T\), since a vibrational mode has both kinetic and potential energy modes.

The proof of the law of equipartition of energy is beyond the scope of this book. Here we shall apply the law to predict the specific heats of gases theoretically. Later we shall also discuss briefly, the application to specific heat of solids.

### Specific Heat Capacity

#### Monatomic Gases

The molecule of a monatomic gas has only three translational degrees of freedom. Thus, the average energy of a molecule at temperature \(T\) is \((3/2)k_{{}_{B}}T\). The total internal energy of a mole of such a gas is

Figure 13.6: The two independent axes of rotation of a diatomic molecule

\[\cdot\] \[U\quad\frac{3}{2}k_{{}_{B}}T\quad N_{{}_{A}}\quad\frac{3}{2}RT \tag{13.27}\]

The molar specific heat at constant volume. \(C_{{}_{v}}\) is

\[C_{{}_{v}}(\mbox{monatomic gas})=\frac{\cdot}{\mbox{d}U}\cdot\frac{\cdot}{2}RT \tag{13.28}\]

For an ideal gas.

\(C_{{}_{p}}-C_{{}_{v}}=R\) (13.29)

where \(C_{{}_{p}}\) is the molar specific heat at constant pressure. Thus,

\[C_{{}_{p}}=\frac{\dot{5}}{2}\ R \tag{13.30}\]

The ratio of specific heats \(\frac{C_{{}_{p}}}{C_{{}_{v}}}\) \(\frac{5}{3}\) (13.31)

#### 13.6.2 Diatomic Gases

As explained earlier, a diatomic molecule treated as a rigid rotator like a dumbbell has 5 degrees of freedom : 3 translational and 2 rotational. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the total internal energy of a mole of such a gas is

\[\cdot\] \[U\quad\frac{5}{2}k_{{}_{B}}T\quad N_{{}_{A}}\quad\frac{5}{2}RT \tag{13.32}\]

The molar specific heats are then given by

\[C_{{}_{v}}(\mbox{rigid diatomic})=\frac{\dot{5}}{2}R.\ C_{{}_{p}}=\frac{\dot{7}}{2}R \tag{13.33}\]

\[\gamma(\mbox{rigid diatomic})=\frac{7}{5} \tag{13.34}\]

If the diatomic molecule is not rigid but has in addition a vibrational mode

\[\cdot\] \[U\quad-\left(\frac{5}{2}k_{{}_{B}}T+k_{{}_{B}}T\right)N_{{}_{A}} \quad-\frac{7}{2}RT\] \[\cdot\] \[C_{{}_{v}}\quad\frac{7}{2}R.\ C_{{}_{p}}\quad\frac{9}{2}R,\qquad \frac{9}{7}R \tag{13.35}\]

#### 13.6.3 Polyatomic Gases

In general a polyatomic molecule has 3 translational. 3 rotational degrees of freedom and a certain number (\(f\)) of vibrational modes. According to the law of equipartition of energy, it is easily seen that one mole of such a gas has

\[U=\frac{\dot{3}}{2}\ k_{{}_{B}}T+\frac{\dot{3}}{2}\ k_{{}_{B}}T+fk_{{}_{B}}T \ \rangle\ N_{{}_{A}}\]

i.e. \(C_{{}_{v}}=(3+f)\ R\), \(C_{{}_{p}}=(4+f)\ R\),

\[\frac{f}{f} \tag{13.36}\]

Note that \(C_{{}_{p}}-C_{{}_{v}}=R\) is true for any ideal gas, whether mono, di or polyatomic.

Table 13.1 summarises the theoretical predictions for specific heats of gases ignoring any vibrational modes of motion. The values are in good agreement with experimental values of specific heats of several gases given in Table 13.2. Of course, there are discrepancies between predicted and actual values of specific heats of several other gases (not shown in the table), such as Cl\({}_{{}_{2}}\), C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{{}_{6}}\) and many other polyatomic gases. Usually, the experimental values for specific heats of these gases are greater than the predicted values given in Table 13.1 suggesting that the agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes of motion in the calculation. The law of equipartition of energy is thus well

**verified experimentally at ordinary temperatures.**

**Example 13.8**: Acylinder of fixed capacity 44.8 litres contains helium gas at standard temperature and pressure. What is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of the gas in the cylinder by 15.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C? (\(R=8.31\) J mol-1 K-1).

_Answer_ **Using the gas law** \(PV=\mu RT\)**, you can easily show that 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at standard temperature (273 K) and pressure (1 atm = 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa) occupies a volume of 22.4 litres. This universal volume is called molar volume. Thus the cylinder in this example contains 2 mol of helium. Further, since helium is monatomic, its predicted (and observed) molar specific heat at constant volume. \(C_{v}=(3/2)\)\(R\), and molar specific heat at constant pressure. \(C_{p}=(3/2)\)\(R\)\(+\)\(R=(5/2)\)\(R\). Since the volume of the cylinder is fixed, the heat required is determined by \(C_{v}\) Therefore.

Heat required = no. of moles \(\times\) molar specific heat \(\times\) rise in temperature

 = 2 \(\times\) 1.5 \(R\)\(\times\) 15.0 = 45 \(R\)

 = 45 \(\times\) 8.31 = 374 J. \(\qed\)

**13.6.4**: Specific Heat Capacity of Solids

We can use the law of equipartition of energy to determine specific heats of solids. Consider a solid of \(N\) atoms, each vibrating about its mean position. An oscillation in one dimension has average energy of 2 \(\times\) % \(k_{B}T=k_{B}T\). In three dimensions, the average energy is 3 \(k_{B}T\). For a mole of solid, \(N=N_{A}\), and the total energy is

\(U=3\)\(k_{B}T\)\(\times\)\(N_{A}=3\)\(RT\)

Now at constant pressure \(\Delta Q=\Delta U+P\Delta V\) = \(\Delta U\). since for a solid \(\Delta V\) is negligible. Hence.

\(C\)\(T\)\(T\)\(T\)\(3R\)

**Table 13.3**: Specific Heat Capacity of some solids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure

**Example 13.6.5**: Specific Heat Capacity of Water

We treat water like a solid. For each atom average energy is 3\(k_{B}T\). Water molecule has three atoms.

two hydrogen and one oxygen. So it has

\(U=3\times 3\)\(k_{B}T\)\(\times\)\(N_{A}\) = 9 \(RT\)

and \(C=\Delta Q/\Delta T=\Delta U/\Delta T=9R\).

This is the value observed and the agreement is very good. In the calorie. gram, degree units, water is defined to have unit specific heat. As 1 calorie = 4.179 joules and one mole of water is 18 grams, the heat capacity per mole is \(\sim\) 75 J mol-1 K-1 \(\sim\) 9R. However with more complex molecules like alcohol or acetone the arguments, based on degrees of freedom, become more complicated.

Lastly, we should note an important aspect of the predictions of specific heats, based on the classical law of equipartition of energy. The predicted specific heats are independent of temperature. As we go to low temperatures, however, there is a marked departure from this prediction. Specific heats of all substances approach zero as \(T\to 0\). This is related to the fact that degrees of freedom get frozen and ineffective at low temperatures. According to classical physics degrees of freedom must remain unchanged at all times. The behaviour of specific heats at low temperatures shows the inadequacy of classical physics and can be explained only by invoking quantum considerations, as was first shown by Einstein. Quantum mechanics requires a minimum. nonzero amount of energy before a degree of freedom comes into play. This is also the reason why vibrational degrees of freedom come into play only in some cases.

**13.7**: MEAN FREE PATH

Molecules in a gas have rather large speeds of the order of the speed of sound. Yet a gas leaking from a cylinder in a kitchen takes considerable time to diffuse to the other corners of the room. The top of a cloud of smoke holds together for hours. This happens because molecules in a gas have a finite though small size, so they are bound to undergo collisions. As a result, they cannot

## 11 Seeing is Believing

Can one see atoms rushing about. Almost but not quite. One can see pollen grains of a flower being pushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is \(\sim 10^{-5}\) m. In 1827, a Scottish botanist Robert Brown, while examining, under a microscope, pollen grains of a flower suspended in water noticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag, random fashion.

Kinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is continuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random, the number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in the opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the total number of hits for an object of ordinary size, and we do not notice any movement of the object.

When the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular hits from different directions is not altogether negligible, i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the suspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium (water or some other fluid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The suspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly. This motion called now 'Brownian motion' is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so molecules have been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes.

In 1987 Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the molecules but also their detailed interactions. He did this by illuminating them with flashes of laser light for very short durations, of the order of tens of femtoseconds and photographing them. (1 femtosecond = 10\({}^{-15}\) s). One could study even the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. That is really seeing!

**move straight unhindered; their paths keep getting incessantly deflected.**

Suppose the molecules of a gas are spheres of diameter \(d\). Focus on a single molecule with the average speed <>0. It will suffer collision with any molecule that comes within a distance \(d\) between the centres. In time \(\Delta t\), it sweeps a volume \(\pi d^{2}\) <> \(\Delta t\) wherein any other molecule will collide with it (see Fig. 11.7). If \(n\) is the number of molecules per unit volume, the molecule suffers \(n\pi d^{2}\) <> \(\Delta t\) collisions in time \(\Delta t\). Thus the rate of collisions is \(n\pi d^{2}\) <>\(\nu\) or the time between two successive collisions is on the average,

\[\tau=1/(n\pi<\nu>d^{2}) \tag{11.38}\]

The average distance between two successive collisions, called the mean free path l, is :

\[l=<\nu>\tau=1/(n\pi d^{2}) \tag{11.39}\]

In this derivation, we imagined the other molecules to be at rest. But actually all molecules are moving and the collision rate is determined by the average relative velocity of the molecules. Thus we need to replace <>\(\nu\) by <\(\nu\)> in Eq. (11.38). A more exact treatment gives?

\[l\ 1/\sqrt{2}\ n\ \ d^{2} \tag{11.40}\]

Let us estimate \(l\) and \(\tau\) for air molecules with average speeds <>\(\nu\) = ( 485m/s). At STP

\[n=\frac{0.02\ \ \ 10^{23}}{22.4\ \ \ 10^{-3}}\]

= \(2.7\times 10^{25}\) m -3.

Taking, \(d=2\times 10^{-10}\) m,

\(\tau=6.1\times 10^{-10}\) s

and \(l=2.9\times 10^{-7}\) m = \(1500d\)

Figure 11.7: The volume swept by a molecule in time \(\Delta t\) in which any molecule will collide with it.

As expected, the mean free path given by Eq. (13.40) depends inversely on the number density and the size of the molecules. In a highly evacuated tube \(n\) is rather small and the mean free path can be as large as the length of the tube.

**Example 13.9**: Estimate the mean free path for a water molecule in water vapour at 373 K. Use information from Exercises 13.1 and Eq. (13.41) above.

_Answer_ **The \(d\) for water vapour is same as that of air. The number density is inversely proportional to absolute temperature.**

SUMMARY

1. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure {P}, volume {V} and absolute temperature {T} is _PV_ = \(\mu\)_RT_ = \(k_{{}_{B}}\)_NT_ where \(\mu\) is the number of moles and \(N\) is the number of molecules. \(R\) and \(k_{{}_{B}}\)are universal constants. \(R\) = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1, \(k_{{}_{B}}\) = \(\frac{R}{N_{{}_{A}}}\) = 1.38 x 10^-23 J K-1 Real gases satisfy the ideal gas equation only approximately, more so at low pressures and high temperatures. 2. Kinetic theory of an ideal gas gives the relation \(\cdot\) where \(n\) is number density of molecules, \(m\) the mass of the molecule and \(\cdot\) is the mean of squared speed. Combined with the ideal gas equation it yields a kinetic interpretation of temperature. \(\cdot\) This tells us that the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a molecule. _independent of the nature of the gas or molecule._ In a mixture of gases at a fixed temperature the heavier molecule has the lower average speed. 3. The translational kinetic energy \(E\) = \(\frac{3}{2}\)\(k_{{}_{B}}\)_NT_. This leads to a relation \(PV\) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)\(E\)
4. The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute temperature \(T\), the total energy is distributed equally in different energy modes of

[**Hint** : Use Graham's law of diffusion: R\({}_{j}\)/R\({}_{2}\) = (M\({}_{2}\) / M\({}_{1}\))\({}^{1/2}\), where R\({}_{1}\), R\({}_{2}\) are diffusion rates of gases 1 and 2, and M\({}_{1}\) and M\({}_{2}\) their respective molecular masses. The law is a simple consequence of kinetic theory.
13.13 A gas in equilibrium has uniform density and pressure throughout its volume. This is strictly true only if there are no external influences. A gas column under gravity. for example, does not have uniform density (and pressure). As you might expect, its density decreases with height. The precise dependence is given by the so-called law of atmospheres \[n_{2}=n_{1}\exp\left[\ -mg\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right)/\ k_{3}T\right]\] where \(n_{1}\), \(n_{1}\) refer to number density at heights \(h_{2}\) and \(h_{1}\) respectively. Use this relation to derive the equation for sedimentation equilibrium of a suspension in a liquid column: \[n_{2}=n_{1}\exp\left[\ -mg\,N_{A}\left\{\rho\ -P^{\prime}\right\}\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right)/\left\{ \rho\ R\,T\right\}\right]\] where \(\rho\) is the density of the suspended particle, and \(\rho\)' that of surrounding medium.

### Periodic and Oscillatory Motions

Fig 14.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down it comes back to the initial point and repeats the process identically. If you draw a graph of its height above the ground versus time, it would look something like Fig. 14.1 (a). If a child climbs up a step, comes down, and repeats the process, its height above the ground would look like that in Fig 14.1 (b). When you play the game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between your palm and the ground, its height versus time graph would look like the one in Fig 14.1 (c). Note that both the curved parts in Fig 14.1 (c) are sections of a parabola given by the Newton's equation of motion (see section 3.6).

\[h=ut+\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}\,\,\,\text{for downward motion, and}\]

\[h=ut-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}\,\,\,\text{for upward motion,}\]

with different values of \(u\) in each case. These are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called **periodic motion.**

Very often the body undergoing periodic motion has an equilibrium position somewhere inside its path. When the body is at this position no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the body is given a small displacement from the position, a force comes into play which tries to bring the body back to the equilibrium point, giving rise to **oscillations** or **vibrations**. For example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little from the point, it will perform oscillations in the bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but every periodic motion need not be oscillatory. Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is not oscillatory.

There is no significant difference between oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like the vibration of a string of a musical instrument).

Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position. Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position.

In practice, oscillating bodies eventually come to rest at their equilibrium positions, because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes. However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter.

Any material medium can be pictured as a collection of a large number of coupled oscillators. The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves. Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves. We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter.

**14.2.1**Period and frequency

We have seen that any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called **periodic motion**. **The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its period**. Let us denote the period by the symbol \(T\). Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,which are either too fast or too slow on the scale of seconds, other convenient units of time are used. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds (10\({}^{\rm o}\) s) abbreviated as us. On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days. The Halley's comet appears after every 76 years.

The reciprocal of \(T\) gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time. This quantity is called the **frequency of the periodic motion**. It is represented by the symbol \(v\). The relation between \(v\) and \(T\) is

\[v=1/T \tag{14.1}\]

The unit of \(v\) is thus s-1. After the discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857-1894), a special name has been given to the unit of frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz). Thus,

1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s-1

Note, that the frequency, \(v\), is not necessarily an integer.

**Example 14.1**: On an average a human heart is found to beat 75 times in a minute. Calculate its frequency and period.

_Answer_ The beat frequency of heart = 75/(1 min) = 75/(60 s) = 1.25 s-1 = 1.25 Hz The time period \(T\) = 1/(1.25 s-1) = 0.8 s

#### 14.2.2 Displacement

In section 4.2, we defined displacement of a particle as the change in its position vector. In this chapter, we use the term displacement in a more general sense. It refers to change with time of any physical property under consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance from the starting point as a function of time is its position displacement. The choice of origin is a matter of convenience. Consider a block attached to a spring, the other end of which is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig. 14.2(a)]. Generally it is convenient to measure displacement of the body from its equilibrium position. For an oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the vertical as a function of time may be regarded as a displacement variable [see Fig. 14.2(b)]. The term displacement is not always to be referred in the context of position only. There can be many other kinds of displacement variables. The voltage across a capacitor, changing with time in an a.c. circuit, is also a displacement variable. In the same way, pressure variations in time in the propagation of sound wave, the changing electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are examples of displacement in different contexts. The displacement variable may take both positive and negative values. In experiments on oscillations, the displacement is measured for different times.

The displacement can be represented by a mathematical function of time. In case of periodic motion, this function is periodic in time. One of the simplest periodic functions is given by

\[f(0)=A\cos\alpha \tag{14.3a}\]

If the argument of this function, \(\alpha\), is increased by an integral multiple of \(2\pi\) radians,the value of the function remains the same. The function \(f(t)\) is then periodic and its period, \(T\), is given by

\[\overset{\cdot}{T}=\frac{2\pi}{\omega} \tag{14.3b}\]

Thus, the function \(f(t)\) is periodic with period \(T\),

\[f(t)=f(t+T)\]

The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, \(f(t)=A\,\sin\,\omega\). Further, a linear combination of sine and cosine functions like,

\[f(t)=A\,\sin\,\omega+B\,\cos\,\omega \tag{14.3c}\]

is also a periodic function with the same period \(T\). Taking,

\[A=D\,\cos\,\phi\,\,and\,\,B=D\sin\,\phi\]

Eq. (14.3c) can be written as,

\[f(t)=D\,\sin\,(\omega+\phi)\,\,, \tag{14.3d}\]

Here \(D\) and \(\phi\) are constant given by

\[\cdot\] \[D=\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}\,\,\,\text{and}\qquad\tan^{-1}\frac{B}{A}\]

The great importance of periodic sine and cosine functions is due to a remarkable result proved by the French mathematician, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830): **Any periodic function can be expressed as a superposition of sine and cosine functions of different time periods with suitable coefficients**.

**Example 14.2**: Which of the following functions of time represent (a) periodic and (b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for each case of periodic motion [\(\omega\) is any positive constant],

\[\sin\,\omega+\cos\,\omega \tag{14.3b}\]

Thus, the function \(f(t)\) is periodic with period \(T\),

\[f(t)=f(t+T)\]

The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, \(f(t)=A\,\sin\,\omega\). Further, a linear combination of sine and cosine functions like,

\[f(t)=A\,\sin\,\omega+B\cos\,\omega \tag{14.3c}\]

is also a periodic function with the same period \(T\). Taking,

\[A=D\,\cos\,\phi\,\,and\,\,B=D\sin\,\phi\]

Eq. (14.3c) can be written as,

\[f(t)=A\,\sin\,\omega+B\cos\,\omega \tag{14.3d}\]

Here \(D\) and \(\phi\) are constant given by

\[\cdot\] \[D=\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}\,\,\,\text{and}\qquad\tan^{-1}\frac{B}{A}\]

The great importance of periodic sine and cosine functions is due to a remarkable result proved by the French mathematician, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830): **Any periodic function can be expressed as a superposition of sine and cosine functions of different time periods with suitable coefficients**.

**Example 14.2**: Which of the following functions of time represent (a) periodic and (b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for each case of periodic motion [\(\omega\) is any positive constant],

\[\sin\,\omega+\cos\,\omega \tag{14.3e}\]

_where_

\[\omega=\frac{\pi}{\omega}\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\text{and}\,\, \,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\text{andby taking'snapshots' at regular intervals of time. A set of such snapshots is shown in Fig. 14.4. The position of the particle with reference to the origin gives its displacement at any instant of time. For such a motion the displacement \(x(t)\) of the particle from a certain chosen origin is found to vary with time as,

The motion represented by Eq. (14.4) is called **simple harmonic motion** (SHM); a term that means the periodic motion is a sinusoidal function of time. Equation (14.4), in which the sinusoidal function is a cosine function, is plotted in Fig. 14.5.

The quantities that determine the shape of the graph are displayed in Fig. 14.6 along with the ir names.

We shall now define these quantities.

The quantity \(A\) is called the **amplitude** of the motion. It is a positive constant which represents the magnitude of the maximum displacement of the particle in either direction. The cosine function in Eq. (14.4) varies between the limits \(\pm 1\), so the displacement \(x(t)\) varies between the limits \(\pm A\). In Fig. 14.7 (a), the curves 1 and 2 are plots of Eq. (14.4) for two different amplitudes \(A\) and \(B\). The difference between these curves illustrates the significance of amplitude.

The time varying quantity, \((\omega+\phi)\), in Eq. (14.4) is called the **phase** of the motion. It describes the state of motion at a given time. The constant \(\phi\)is called the **phase constant** (or **phase angle**). The value of \(\phi\)depends on the displacement and velocity of the particle at \(t=0\). This can be understood better by considering Fig. 14.7(b). In this figure, the curves 3 and 4 represent plots of Eq. (14.4) for two values of the phase constant \(\phi\).

It can be seen that the phase constant signifies the initial conditions.

The constant \(\omega\) called the angular frequency of the motion, is related to the period \(T\). To get

The length of the vector arrows is scaled to indicate the speed of the particle. The speed is maximum when the particle is at the origin and zero when it is at \(\pm A\). If the time \(t\) is chosen to be zero when the particle is at +A, then the particle returns to +A at \(t=T\). where \(T\) is the period of the motion. The motion is then repeated. It is represented by Eq. (14.4) for \(\phi=0\).

their relationship, let us consider Eq. (14.4) with \(\phi=0\); it then reduces to,

\[x(t)=A\cos\omega dt \tag{14.5}\]

Now since the motion is periodic with a period \(T\), the displacement \(x(t)\) must return to its initial value after one period of the motion; th at is, \(x(t)\) must be equal to \(x(t+T)\) for all \(t\). Applying this condition to Eq. (14.5) leads to,

\[A\cos\omega dt=A\cos\omega dt+T \tag{14.6}\]

As the cosine function first repeats itself when its argument (the phase) has increased by \(2\pi\), Eq. (14.6) gives,

\[d(t+T)=\omega dt+2\pi\]

or \(d\pi=2\pi\)

Thus, the angular frequency is,

\[\omega=2\pi/T \tag{14.7}\]

The SI unit of angular frequency is radians per second. To illustrate the significance of period \(T\), sinusoidal functions with two different periods are plotted in Fig. 14.8.

**We have had an introduction to simple harmonic motion. In the next section we will discuss the simplest example of simple harmonic motion. It will be shown that the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the circle executes simple harmonic motion.**

**Example 14.3**: Which of the following functions of time represent (a) simple harmonic motion and (b) periodic but not simple harmonic? Give the period for each case.

\((1)\)\(\sin\omega dt-\cos\omega dt\)

\((2)\)\(\sin^{2}\omega dt\)

_Answer_

**(a)**: \(\sin\omega dt-\cos\omega dt\)

\(=\sin\omega dt-\sin\left(\pi/2-\omega dt\right)\)

\(=2\cos\left(\pi/4\right)\)\(\sin\left(\omega dt-\pi/4\right)\)

\(=\dot{\Phi}\sin\left(\omega-\pi/4\right)\)

This function represents a simple harmonic motion having a period \(T=2\pi/\omega\) and a phase angle (-\(\pi/4\)) or (7\(\pi/4\))

\(\sin^{2}\omega dt\)

The function is periodic having a period \(T=\pi/\omega\) It also represents a harmonic motion with the point of equilibrium occurring at \(\omega_{2}\) instead of zero. \(\ll\)

**14.4**: SMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND UNIFORM CIRULAR MOTION

In 1610, Galileo discovered four principal moons of the planet Jupiter. To him, each moon seemed to move back and forth relative to the planet in a simple harmonic motion; the disc of the planet forming the mid point of the motion. The record of his observations, written in his own hand, is still available. Based on his data, the position of the moon Callisto relative to Jupiter is plotted in Fig. 14.9. In this figure, the circles represent Galileo's data points and the curve drawn is a best fit to the data. The curve obeys Eq. (14.4), which is the displacement function for SHM. It gives a period of about 16.8 days.

It is now well known that Callisto moves with essentially a constant speed in an almost circular orbit around Jupiter. Its true motion is uniform circular motion. What Galileo saw and what we can also see, with a good pair of binoculars, is the projection of this uniform circular motion on a line in the plane of motion. This can easily be visualised by performing a 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:327]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:328]

We have seen that a particle executing a uniform circular motion is subjected to a radial acceleration **a** directed towards the centre. Figure 14.13 shows such a radial acceleration, **a**, of the reference particle P executing uniform circular motion. The magnitude of the radial acceleration of P is \(\omega A\). Its projection on the x-axis at any time \(t\) is,

\[a\left(t\right) = -\omega A\cos\left(\alpha+\phi\right) \tag{14.11}\] \[= -\omega x\left(t\right)\]

which is the acceleration of the particle P\({}^{\prime}\) (the projection of particle P). Equation (14.11), therefore, represents the instantaneous acceleration of the particle P\({}^{\prime}\), which is executing **SHM**. Thus Eq. (14.11) expresses the acceleration of a particle executing **SHM**. It is an important result for **SHM**. It shows that in **SHM**, the acceleration is proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the mean position. Eq. (14.11) can also be obtained by differentiating Eq. (14.9) with respect to time as,

\[a(t)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\,v(t) \tag{14.12}\]

The inter-relationship between the displacement of a particle executing simple harmonic motion, its velocity and acceleration can be seen in Fig. 14.14. In this figure (a) is a plot of Eq. (14.4) with \(\phi=0\) and (b) depicts Eq. (14.9) also with \(\phi=0\). Similar to the amplitude \(A\) in Eq. (14.4), the positive quantity \(\omega A\) in Eq. (14.9) is called the **velocity amplitude**\(v_{m}\). In Fig. 14.14(b), it can be seen that the velocity of the oscillating particle varies between the limits \(\pm v_{\mathrm{\tau_{R}}}=\pm\omega A\). Note that the curve of \(v(t)\) is shifted (to the left) from the curve of \(x(t)\) by one quarter period and thus the particle velocity lags behind the displacement by a phase angle of \(\pi/2\); when the magnitude of displacement is the greatest, the magnitude of the velocity is the least. When the magnitude of displacement is the least, the velocity is the greatest. Figure 14.14(c) depicts the variation of the particle acceleration \(a(t)\). It is seen that when the displacement has its greatest positive value, the acceleration has its greatest negative value and vice versa. When the displacement is zero, the acceleration is also zero.

**Example 14.5**: A body oscillates with SHM according to the equation (in SI units),

\[x=5\cos\left[2\pi\,t+\pi/4\right]\]

At \(t=1.5\) s, calculate the (a) displacement.

(b) speed and(c) acceleration of the body.

_Answer_ The angular frequency \(\omega\) of the body = \(2\pi\) s\({}^{-1}\) and its time period \(T=1\) s.

At \(t=1.5\) s

(a) displacement = (5.0 m) cos [(2\(\pi\) s\({}^{-1}\)) \(\times\) 1.5 s + \(\pi/4\)]

Figure 14.13: The acceleration. a(t). of the particle P\({}^{\prime}\) is the projection of the acceleration **a** of the reference particle P.

\(=(5.0\,\mathrm{m})\cos\,[(3\pi+\pi/4)]\) \(=-5.0\times 0.707\) m \(=-3.535\) m
2. Using Eq. (14.9), the speed of the body \(=-(5.0\,\mathrm{m})(2\pi\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})\sin\,[(2\pi\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})\times 1.5\,\mathrm{s}\) \(=-(5.0\,\mathrm{m})(2\pi\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})\sin\,[(3\pi+\pi/4)]\) \(=10\pi\times 0.707\) m s\({}^{-1}\) \(=22\) m s\({}^{-1}\)
3. Using Eq.(14.10), the acceleration of the body \(=-(2\pi\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{2}\times\mathrm{displacement}\) \(=-(2\pi\,\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{2}\times(-3.535\) m) \(=140\) m s\({}^{-2}\)

### Forcelaw for Simple Harmonic Motion

In Section14.3, we described the simple harmonic motion. Now we discuss how it can be generated. Newton's second law of motion relates the force acting on a system and the corresponding acceleration produced. Therefore, if we know how the acceleration of a particle varies with time, this law can be used to learn about the force, which must act on the particle to give it that acceleration. If we combine Newton's second law and Eq. (14.11), we find that for simple harmonic motion,

\[F\left(t\right) =ma\] \[=-m\vartheta\,x\left(t\right)\] or \[F\left(t\right) =-k\,x\left(t\right)\] (14.13) where \[k=m\vartheta\] (14.14a) or \[\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \tag{14.14b}\]

Equation (14.13) gives the force acting on the particle. It is proportional to the displacement and directed in an opposite direction. Therefore, it is a restoring force. Note that unlike the centripetal force for uniform circular motion that is constant in magnitude, the restoring force for SHM is time dependent. The force law expressed by Eq. (14.13) can be taken as an alternative definition of simple harmonic motion. It states :

**Simple harmonic motion is the motion executed by a particle subject to a force, which is proportional to the displacement of the particle and is directed towards the mean position.**

Since the force \(F\) is proportional to \(x\) rather than to some other power of \(x\), such a system is also referred to as a **linear harmonic oscillator**. Systems in which the restoring force is a nonlinear function of \(x\) are termed as non-linear harmonic or anharmonic oscillators.

**Example 14.6**: Two identical springs of spring constant \(k\) are attached to a block of mass \(m\) and to fixed supports as shown in Fig. 14.15. Show that when the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position on either side, it executes a simple harmonic motion.

Find the period of oscillations.

_Answer_ Let the mass be displaced by a small distance \(x\) to the right side of the equilibrium position, as shown in Fig. 14.16. Under this situation the spring on the left side gets

elongated by a length equal to \(x\) and that on the right side gets compressed by the same length. The forces acting on the mass are then,

\(F_{1}=-kx\) (force exerted by the spring on the left side, trying to pull the mass towards the mean position)

\(F_{2}=-kx\) (force exerted by the spring on the right side, trying to push the mass towards the mean position)The net force, \(F\), acting on the mass is then given by,

\(F=-2kx\)

Hence the force acting on the mass is proportional to the displacement and is directed towards the mean position; therefore, the motion executed by the mass is simple harmonic. The time period of oscillations is,

\(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{2k}}\)

### Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

A particle executing simple harmonic motion has kinetic and potential energies, both varying between the limits, zero and maximum.

In section14.5 we have seen that the velocity of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K) of such a particle, which is defined as

\(\cdot\)

\(K=\frac{1}{2}\,mw^{2}\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}m\,\omega^{2}A^{2}\,\sin^{2}(\omega t+\phi)\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}\,k\,A^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega t+\phi)\)

is also a periodic function of time, being zero when the displacement is maximum and maximum when the particle is at the mean position. Note, since the sign of \(\omega\) is immaterial in \(K\), the period of \(K\) is \(T/2\).

What is the potential energy (PE) of a particle executing simple harmonic motion? In Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of potential energy is possible only for conservative forces. The spring force \(F=-kx\) is a conservative force, with associated potential energy

\(\cdot\)

\(U=\frac{1}{2}k\,x^{2}\)

Hence the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is,

\(U\{x\}=\frac{\cdot}{2}k\,x^{2}\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}k\,A^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega t+\phi)\)

Thus the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is also periodic, with period \(T/2\), being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extreme displacements.

It follows from Eqs. (14.15) and (14.17) that the total energy, \(E\), of the system is,

\(E=U+K\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}k\,A^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega t+\phi)+\frac{1}{2}k\,A^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega t +\phi)\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}k\,A^{2}\left[\cos^{2}(\omega t+\phi)+\sin^{2}(\omega t+\phi)\right]\)

The quantity within the square brackets above is unity and we have,

\(\cdot\)

\(E=\frac{1}{2}k\,A^{2}\)

The total mechanical energy of a harmonic oscillator is thus independent of time as expected for motion under any conservative force. The time and displacement dependence of the potential and kinetic energies of a linear simple harmonic oscillator are shown in Fig.14.17.

It is observed that in a linear harmonic oscillator, all energies are positive and peak twice during every period. For \(x=0\), the energy is all kinetic and for \(x=\pm A\) it is all potential.

In between these extreme positions, the potential energy increases at the expense of kinetic energy. This behaviour of a linear harmonic oscillator suggests that it possesses an element of springiness and an element of inertia. The former stores its potential energy and the latter stores its kinetic energy.

_Answer_ The block executes SHM, its angular frequency, as given by Eq. (14.14b), is

\[\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\sqrt{\frac{50\ N\ m^{-1}}{1\rm kg}}\] \[=7.07\ \rm rad\ s^{-1}\]

Its displacement at any time \(t\) is then given by,

\[x(t)=0.1\cos\ (7.07t)\]

Therefore, when the particle is \(5\,\rm cm\) away from the mean position, we have

\[0.05=0.1\cos\ (7.07t)\]

Or \(\cos\ (7.07t)=0.5\) and hence

\[\cdot\] \[\sin\ (7.07t)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=0.866,\]

Then the velocity of the block at \(x=5\,\rm cm\) is

\[=0.1\times 7.07\times 0.866\ \rm m\ s^{-1}\] \[=0.61\ \rm m\ s^{-1}\]

Hence the K.E. of the block,

\[\cdot\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\,m\,v^{2}\] \[=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}[1\rm kg\times(0.6123\ \rm m\ s^{-1}\ )^{2}\ ]\] \[=0.19\,\rm J\]

The P.E. of the block,

\[\cdot\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\,k\ x^{2}\] \[=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(50\ \rm N\ m^{-1}\times 0.05\ \rm m\times 0.05\ \rm m)\] \[=0.0625\,\rm J\]

The total energy of the block at \(x=5\,\rm cm\),

\[=K.E.+P.E.\] \[=0.25\,\rm J\]

we also know that at maximum displacement, K.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the system is equal to the P.E. Therefore, the total energy of the system,

\[=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(50\ \rm N\ m^{-1}\times 0.1\ \rm m\times 0.1\,\rm m)\] \[=0.25\,\rm J\]

which is same as the sum of the two energies at a displacement of \(5\,\rm cm\). This is in conformity with the principle of conservation of energy. \(\triangleleft\)

**14.8**SOME SYSTEMS EXECUTING SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

There are no physical examples of absolutely pure **simple harmonic motion**. In practice we come across systems that execute simple harmonic motion approximately under certain conditions. In the subsequent part of this section, we discuss the motion executed by some such systems.

Figure 14.17: (a) Potential energy U(f), kinetic energy K(f) and the total energy E as functions of time \(t\) for a linear harmonic oscillator. All energies are positive and the potential and kinetic energies peak twice in every period of the oscillator. (b) Potential energy U(x), kinetic energy K(f) and the total energy E as functions of position x for a linear harmonic oscillator with amplitude A. For x= 0, the energy is all kinetic a and for x= \(\pm\) A it is all potential.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:333]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:334]

Now if \(\theta\) is small, \(\sin\,\theta\) can be approximated by \(\theta\) and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as,

\[\alpha=-\frac{mgL}{I}\theta \tag{14.27}\]

In Table 14.1, we have listed the angle \(\theta\) in degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value of the function \(\sin\,\theta\). From this table it can be seen that for \(\theta\) as large as 20 degrees, \(\sin\,\theta\) is nearly the same as \(\theta\)**expressed in radians**.

Equation (14.27) is the angular analogue of Eq. (14.11) and tells us that the angular acceleration of the pendulum is proportional to the angular displacement \(\theta\) but opposite in sign. Thus as the pendulum moves to the right, its pull to the left increases until it stops and begins to return to the left. Similarly, when it moves towards left, its acceleration to the right tends to return it to the right and so on, as it swings to and fro in SHM. Thus the motion of a **simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately SHM**.

Comparing Eq. (14.27) with Eq. (14.11), we see that the angular frequency of the pendulum is,

\[\omega=\sqrt{\frac{mgL}{I}}\]

and the period of the pendulum, \(T\), is given by,

\[T\qquad\sqrt{\frac{I}{mgL}} \tag{14.28}\]

All the mass of a simple pendulum is centred in the mass \(m\) of the bob, which is at a radius of \(L\) from the pivot point. Therefore, for this system, we can write \(I=m\,L^{2}\) and substituting this in Eq. (14.28) we get,

\[\text{SHM -how small should the amplitude be?}\]

When you perform the experiment to determine the time period of a simple pendulum, your (teacher tells you to keep the amplitude small. But have you ever asked how small is small? Should the amplitude to \(5^{o}\), \(2^{o}\), \(1^{o}\), or \(0.5^{o}\)? Or could it be \(10^{o}\), \(20^{o}\), or \(30^{o}\)?

To appreciate this, it would be better to measure the time period for different amplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of course, for large oscillations, you will have to take care that the pendulum oscillates in a vertical plane. Let us denote the time period for small-amplitude oscillations as \(T(0)\) and write the time period for amplitude \(\theta_{o}\) as \(T(\theta_{o})=cT(0)\), where \(c\) is the multiplying factor. If you plot a graph of \(c\) versus \(\theta_{o}\), you will get values somewhat like this:

\[\theta_{o}\quad:\quad 20^{o}\quad 45^{o}\quad 50^{o}\quad 70^{o}\quad 90^{o}\] \[c\quad:\quad 1.02\quad 1.04\quad 1.05\quad 1.10\quad 1.18\]

This means that the error in the time period is about 2% at an amplitude of \(20^{o}\), 5% at an amplitude of \(50^{o}\), and 10% at an amplitude of \(70^{o}\) and 18% at an amplitude of \(90^{o}\).

In the experiment, you will never be able to measure \(T(0)\) because this means there are no oscillations. Even theoretically, \(\sin\,\theta\) is exactly equal to \(\theta\) only for \(\theta=0\). There will be some inaccuracy for all other values of \(\theta\). The difference increases with increasing \(\theta\). Therefore we have to decide how much error we can tolerate. No measurement is ever perfectly accurate. You must also consider questions like these: What is the accuracy of the stopwatch? What is your own accuracy in starting and stopping the stopwatch? You will realise that the accuracy in your measurements at this level is never better than 5% or 10%. Since the above table shows that the time period of the pendulum increases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of \(50^{o}\) over its low amplitude value, you could very well keep the amplitude to be 50% in your experiments.

\(T\)\(\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\) (14.29)

Equation (14.29) represents a simple expression for the time period of a simple pendulum.

Example 14.9: What is the length of a simple pendulum, which ticks seconds?

Answer: From Eq. (14.29), the time period of a simple pendulum is given by,

\(T\)\(\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\)

From this relation one gets,

\(L\)\(\frac{gT^{2}}{4^{\ 2}}\)

The time period of a simple pendulum, which ticks seconds, is 2 s. Therefore, for \(g=9.8\) m s\({}^{2}\) and \(T\) = 2 s, \(L\) is

\(\cdot\)\(\frac{9.8(m\) s\({}^{-2})\ 4(s^{2})}{4^{\ 2}}\)

= 1 m

### Damped Simple Harmonic Motion

We know that the motion of a simple pendulum, swinging in air, dies out eventually. Why does it happen? This is because the air drag and the friction at the support oppose the motion of the pendulum and dissipate its energy gradually. The pendulum is said to execute **damped oscillations**. In damped oscillations, although the energy of the system is continuously dissipated, the oscillations remain apparently periodic. The dissipating forces are generally the frictional forces. To understand the effect of such external forces on the motion of an oscillator, let us consider a system as shown in Fig. 14.20. Here a block of mass \(m\) oscillates vertically on a spring with spring constant \(k\). The block is connected to a vane through a rod (the vane and the rod are considered to be massless). The vane is submerged in a liquid. As the block oscillates up and down, the vane also moves along with it in the liquid. The up and down motion of the vane displaces the liquid, which in turn, exerts an inhibiting drag force (viscous drag) on it and thus on the entire oscillating system. With time, the mechanical energy of the block-spring system decreases, as energy is transferred to the thermal energy of the liquid and vane.

Let the damping force exerted by the liquid on the system be*\(F_{d}\). Its magnitude is proportional to the velocity **v** of the vane or the block. The force acts in a direction opposite to the direction of **v**. This assumption is valid only when the vane moves slowly. Then for the motion along the \(x\)-axis (vertical direction as shown in Fig. 14.20), we have

\(F_{d}=-b\)**v** (14.30)

where \(b\) is a **damping constant** that depends on the characteristics of the liquid and the vane. The negative sign makes it clear that the force is opposite to the velocity at every moment.

When the mass \(m\) is attached to the spring and released, the spring will elongate a little and the mass will settle at some height. This position, shown by O in Fig 14.20, is the equilibrium position of the mass. If the mass is pulled down or pushed up a little, the restoring force on the block due to the spring is \(F_{s}=-k\)**x**, where **x** is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. Thus the total force acting 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:337]

\[\cdot\] \[T_{{}_{1/2}}=\frac{\ln(1/2)}{\mathbf{b}/2\mathbf{m}}\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\frac{0.693}{40}\quad\mathbf{2}\quad\mathbf{2}\quad\mathbf{2}00\ \mathbf{s}\] \[=6.93\ \mathbf{s}\]

(c) For calculating the time, \(t_{{}_{1/2}}\), for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value we make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation we have,

\[E\left(t_{{}_{1/2}}\right)/E\left(0\right) =\exp\left(-bt_{{}_{1/2}}/m\right)\] Or \[\nu_{2} =\exp\left(-bt_{{}_{1/2}}/m\right)\] \[\ln\left(1/2\right) =-(bt_{{}_{1/2}}/m)\] Or \[t_{{}_{1/2}} \frac{0.693}{40\ \mathbf{g}\ \mathbf{s}^{-1}}\quad\mathbf{2}00\ \mathbf{g}\] \[=3.46\ \mathbf{s}\]

This is just half of the decay period for amplitude. This is not suprising, because, according to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy depends on the square of the amplitude. Notice that there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of the two exponentials. \(\ll\)

### Forced Oscillations and Resonance

A person swinging in a swing without anyone pushing it or a simple pendulum, displaced and released, are examples of free oscillations. In both the cases, the amplitude of swing will gradually decrease and the system would, ultimately, come to a halt. Because of the ever-present dissipative forces, the free oscillations cannot be sustained in practice. They get damped as seen in section 14.9. However, while swinging in a swing if you apply a push periodically by pressing your feet against the ground, you find that not only the oscillations can now be maintained but the amplitude can also be increased. Under this condition the swing has _forced_, or _driven_, _oscillations_. In case of a system executing driven oscillations under the action of a harmonic force, two angular frequencies are important : (1) **the natural** angular frequency \(\omega\) of the system, which is the angular frequency at which it will oscillate if it were displaced from equilibrium position and then left to oscillate freely, and (2) the angular frequency \(\omega_{d}\) of the external force causing the driven oscillations.

Suppose an external force \(F(t)\) of amplitude \(F_{{}_{0}}\) that varies periodically with time is applied to a damped oscillator. Such a force can be represented as,

\[F(t)=F_{{}_{0}}\cos\omega_{d}t \tag{14.36}\]

The motion of a particle under the combined action of a linear restoring force, damping force and a time dependent driving force represented by Eq. (14.36) is given by,

\[m\,a(t)=-k\,x(t)-bv(t)+F_{{}_{0}}\cos\omega_{d}t\] (14.37a) Substituting \(\mathrm{d}^{2}x/\mathrm{d}t^{2}\) for acceleration in Eq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get \[m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}x}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\quad b\,\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{ \mathrm{d}t}\quad kx\quad F_{{}_{0}}\cos\omega_{d}t \tag{14.37b}\]

This is the equation of an oscillator of mass \(m\) on which a periodic force of (angular) frequency \(\omega_{d}\) is applied. The oscillator initially oscillates with its natural frequency \(\omega\) When we apply the external periodic force, the oscillations with the natural frequency die out, and then the body oscillates with the (angular) frequency of the external periodic force. Its displacement, after the natural oscillations die out, is given by

\[x(t)=A\cos\left(\omega_{d}t+\phi\right) \tag{14.38}\]

where \(t\) is the time measured from the moment when we apply the periodic force.

The amplitude \(A\) is a function of the forced frequency \(\omega_{d}\) and the natural frequency \(\omega\). Analysis shows that it is given by

\[A\quad\frac{F}{m}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:339]

of oscillations and different amplitudes, but this motion is gradually damped and not sustained. Their frequencies of oscillation gradually change and ultimately they oscillate with the frequency of pendulum 1, i.e. the frequency of the driving force but with different amplitudes. They oscillate with small amplitudes. The response of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this set of pendulums. It oscillates with the same frequency as that of pendulum 1 and its amplitude gradually picks up and becomes very large. A resonance-like response is seen. This happens because in this the condition for resonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency of the system coincides with that of the driving force.

All mechanical structures have one or more natural frequencies, and if a structure is subjected to a strong external periodic driving force that matches one of these frequencies, the resulting oscillations of the structure may rupture it. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge at Puget Sound, Washington, USA was opened on July 1, 1940. Four months later winds produced a pulsating resultant force in resonance with the natural frequency of the structure. This caused a steady increase in the amplitude of oscillations until the bridge collapsed. It is for the same reason the marching soldiers break steps while crossing a bridge. Aircraft designers make sure that none of the natural frequencies at which a wing can oscillate match the frequency of the engines in flight. Earthquakes cause vast devastation. It is interesting to note that sometimes, in an earthquake, short and tall structures remain unaffected while the medium height structures fall down. This happens because the natural frequencies of the short structures happen to be higher and those of taller structures lower than the frequency of the seismic waves.

## Summary

* The motions which repeat themselves are called _periodic motion_\(\alpha\)s
* The _period_\(T\) is the time required for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is related to the frequency \(v\) by. \[\cdot\] \[T=\frac{1}{v}\] The _frequency_\(v\) of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per unit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz : \[1\mbox{ hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s^{-1}}\]
* In _simple harmonic motion_ (SHM), the displacement \(x\{\mathbf{\alpha}\}\) of a particle from its equilibrium position is given by. \[x\{\mathbf{t}\}\ =\ A\ \mbox{cos}\ [\alpha\mathbf{\alpha}+\phi ]\qquad\mbox{[displacement]},\] in which \(A\) is the _amplitude_ of the displacement. the quantity \(\{\alpha\mathbf{\alpha}+\phi\}\) is the phase of the motion, and \(\phi\) is the _phase constant_. The _angular frequency_\(\omega\)is related to the period and frequency of the motion by. \[\cdot\] \[\frac{\mathbf{2}}{T}\\[=\] - \(\varpi x[t]\) (acceleration). Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion are periodic functions, having the velocity \(a\,mplitude\,v_{m}\)=\(\omega A\) and \(acceleration\,amplitude\,a_{m}\)=\(\omega^{2}A\), respectively.
6. The force acting simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the centre of motion.
7. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy \(K=\)\(\nu_{2}\)\(mw^{2}\) and potential energy \(U=\)\(\nu_{2}\)\(k\)\(\chi a^{2}\). If no friction is present the mechanical energy of the system, \(E=K+U\) always remains constant even though \(K\) and \(U\) change with time
8. A particle of mass \(m\) oscillating under the influence of a Hooke's law restoring force given by \(F=-\)\(k\)\(x\) exhibits simple harmonic motion with \[\omega\ =\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\] (angular frequency) \[T\ \ \ \ 2\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\] (period) Such a system is also called a linear oscillator.
9. The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately simple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by, \[T\ \ \ 2\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\]
10. The mechanical energy in a real oscillating system decreases during oscillations because external forces, such as drag, inhibit the oscillations and transfer mechanical energy to thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion are then said to be \(damped\). If the \(damping\)\(force\) is given by \(F_{d}=-\)\(\omega\), where \(v\) is the velocity of the oscillator and \(b\) is a \(damping\)\(constant\), then the displacement of the oscillator is given by, \[x\ (t)=A\,e^{-\omega t/2m}\,\cos\,\{\omega\ \ t+\phi\}\] where \(\omega\)', the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\ \ \ \frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}\] If the damping constant is small then \(\omega\)' = \(\omega\) where \(\omega\)is the angular frequency of the undamped oscillator. The mechanical energy \(E\) of the damped oscillator is given by \[\cdot\] \[E(t)\ \ \ \frac{1}{2}kA^{2}e^{\ bt/m}\]
11. If an external force with angular frequency \(\omega_{d}\) acts on an oscillating system with natural angular frequency \(\omega\) the system oscillates with angular frequency \(\omega_{d}\). The amplitude of oscillations is the greatest when \[\omega_{d}\ =\omega\] a condition called \(resonance\).

**POINTS TO PODER**

1. The period \(T\) is the _least time_ after which motion repeats itself. Thus, motion repeats itself after \(nT\) where \(n\) is an integer.
2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion governed by the force law \(F\)= - \(k\) xis simple harmonic.
3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion) as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: \(-m\ddot{\sigma}r\). In the latter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (\(x\)and \(y\)) must differ by \(\omega/2\). Thus, a particle subject to a force \(-m\ddot{\sigma}r\) with initial position (o, \(A\)) and velocity (\(\omega A\), o) will move uniformly in a circle of radius \(A\).
4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given \(\omega\) two arbitrary initial conditions are necessary and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial condition may be (i) initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy and phase.
5. From point 4 above, given amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the initial position or initial velocity.
6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral multiple of the other's frequency. However, a periodic motion can always be expressed as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.
7. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant. Contrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler's third law).
8. The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.
9. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement \(x\) must be expressible in either of the following forms : \[x\)= \(A\) cos \(\alpha\)t + \(B\) sin \(\alpha\)t \[x\)= \(A\) cos \(\{\alpha+\alpha\}\), \(x\)= \(B\) sin \(\{\alpha+\beta\}\) The three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any other two forms). Thus, damped simple harmonic motion [Eq. (14.31)] is not strictly simple harmonic. It is approximately so only for time intervals much less than \(2m/b\) where \(b\) is the damping constant.
10. In forced oscillations, the steady state motion of the particle (after the force oscillations die out) is simple harmonic motion whose frequency is the frequency of the driving frequency \(\omega_{d}\), not the natural frequency \(\omega\) of the particle.

* [11] In the ideal case of zero damping, the amplitude of simple harmonic motion at resonance is infinite. This is no problem since all real systems have some damping, however, small.
* [12] Under forced oscillation, the phase of harmonic motion of the particle differs from the phase of the driving force.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:348]

electromagnetic waves and transmitted through optical cables or the atmosphere, possibly by way of a communication satellite. At the receiving end, the electrical or light signal or the electromagnetic waves are transformed back into sound waves travelling from the telephone to the ear.

Not all waves require a medium for their propagation. We know that light waves can travel through vacuum. The light emitted by stars, which are hundreds of light years away, reaches us through inter-stellar space, which is practically a vacuum.

The waves we come across are mainly of three types: (a) mechanical waves, (b) electromagnetic waves and (c) matter waves. Mechanical waves are most familiar because we encounter them constantly; common examples include water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc. All these waves have certain central features : They are governed by Newton's laws, and can exist only within a material medium, such as water, air, and rock. The common examples of electromagnetic waves are visible and ultraviolet light, radio waves, microwaves, x-rays etc. All electromagnetic waves travel through vacuum at the same speed \(c\), given by

\(c=299,792,458\) m s\({}^{-1}\) (speed of light) (15.1)

Unlike the mechanical waves,the electromagnetic waves do not require any medium for their propagation. You would learn more about these waves later.

Matter waves are associated with moving electrons, protons, neutrons and other fundamental particles, and even atoms and molecules. Because we commonly think of these as constituting matter, such waves are called **matter waves**. They arise in quantum mechanical description of nature that you will learn in your laterstudies. Though conceptually more abstract than mechanical or electromagnetic waves, they have already found applications in several devices basic to modern technology: matter waves associated with electrons are employed in electron microscopes.

In this chapter we will study mechanical waves, which require a material medium for their propagation.

The aesthetic influence of waves on art and literature is seen from very early times; yet the first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back to the seventeenth century. Some of the famous scientists associated with the physics of wave motion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The understanding of physics of waves followed the physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs and physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in elastic media are intimately connected with harmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, cooled springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media.) We shall illustrate this connection through simple examples.

Consider a collection of springs connected to one another as shown in Fig. 15.1. If the spring at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the disturbance travels to the other end. What has happened? The first spring is disturbed from its equilibrium length. Since the second spring is connected to the first, it is also stretched or compressed, and so on. The disturbance moves from one end to the other; but each spring only executes small oscillations about its equilibrium position. As a practical example of this situation, consider a stationary train at a railway station. Different bogies of the train are coupled to each other through a spring coupling. When an engine is attached at one end, it gives a push to the boge next to it; this push is transmitted from one bogie to another without the entire train being bodily displaced.

Now let us consider the propagation of sound waves in air. As the wave passes through air, it compresses or expands a small region of air, This causes a change in the density of that region, say \(\delta\rho\), this change induces a change in pressure, \(\dot{\rho}\), in that region. Pressure is force per unit area, so there is a **restoring force proportional** to the disturbance, just like in a spring. In this case, the quantity similar to extension or compression of the spring is the change in density. If a region is compressed, the molecules in that region are packed together, and they tend to move out to the adjoining region, thereby increasing the density or creating compression in the adjoining region. Consequently, the air in the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding air will rush in making the rarefaction move to the adjoining region. Thus, the compression or rarefaction moves from one region to another. making the propagation of a disturbance possible in air.

In solids, similar arguments can be made. In a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we can think of atoms in a lattice as end points, with springs between pairs of them.

In the subsequent sections of this chapter we are going to discuss various characteristic properties of waves.

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

Mechanical waves can be transverse or longitudinal depending on the relationship between the directions of disturbance or displacement in the medium and that of the propagation of wave. To differentiate between them let us consider the response of a stretched string fixed at one end. If you give a single up-and-down jerk to the free end of this string, as shown in Fig. 15.2, a wave in the form of a single pulse travels along the string. We assume that the string is very long as compared to the size of the pulse. so that the pulse dissipates out by the time it reaches the other end and, therefore, its reflection from the other end may be ignored. The formation and propagation of this pulse is possible because the string is under tension. When you pull your end of the string upwards it begins to pull upwards on the adjacent section of the string, because of the tension between the two sections. As the adjacent section begins to move upwards, it begins to pull the next section upwards, and so on. In the meanwhile you have pulled down your end of the string. As each section moves upwards in turn, it begins to be pulled back downwards by neighbouring sections that are already on the way down. The net result is that a distortion in the shape of the string(the pulse) moves along the string with a certain velocity **v**.

If you move your end up and down in a continuous manner, a continuous wave travels along the string with a velocity **v**. However, if the motion of your hand is a sinusoidal function of time, at any given instant of time the wave will have a sinusoidal shape as shown in Fig. 15.3. The wave has the shape of a sine or cosine curve.

The waves shown in Fig. 15.3 can be studied in two ways. Oneway is to monitor the waveforms as they move to the right, i.e. take a'snapshot' of the string at a given instant of time. Alternatively, we fix our attention to a particular position on the string and monitor the motion of an element at that point as it oscillates up and down while a wave passes through it. We would find that the displacement of every such oscillating string element is transverse (i.e. perpendicular) to the direction of travel of the wave as indicated in Fig. 15.3. Such a wave is said to be a **transverse wave**.

Figure 15.3: A sinusoidal wave is sent along the string. A typical element of the string moves up and down continuously as thewave passes. It is a transverse wave.

Now, let us consider the production of waves in a long air-filled pipe by the movement of a piston as shown in Fig. 15.4. If you suddenly move the piston to the right and then to the left, you are sending a pulse of pressure along the pipe.

The motion of the piston to the right pushes the elements of air next towards the right, changing the air pressure there. The increased pressure in this region then pushes on the elements of air somewhat farther along the pipe. Moving the piston to the left reduces the air pressure next to it. This causes the elements of air next to it move back to the left and then the farther elements follow. Thus, the motion of the air and the change in air pressure travel towards the right along the pipe as a pulse.

If you push and pull on the piston in a simple harmonic manner, a sinusoidal wave travels along the pipe. It may be noted that the motion of the elements of air is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. This motion is said to be _longitudinal_ and the wave produced is, therefore, called a _longitudinal wave_. The sound waves produced in air are such pressure waves and are therefore of longitudinal character.

In short, in transverse waves, the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and in longitudinal waves they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation.

A wave, transverse or longitudinal, is said to be _travelling_ or _progressive_ if it travels from one point of the medium to another. A progressive wave is to be distinguished from a standing or stationary wave (see Section 15.7). In Fig. 15.3 transverse waves travel from one end of the string to the other end while the longitudinal waves in Fig. 15.4 travel from one end of the pipe to its other end. We note again that in both the cases, it is the wave or the disturbance that moves from end to end, not the material through which the waves propagate.

In transverse waves, the particle motion is normal to the direction of propagation of the wave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each element of the medium undergoes a shearing strain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be propagated only in those media which can sustain shearing stress, such as solids and strings, and noin fluids, Fluids as well as solids can sustain compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal waves can propagate in all elastic media. For example, in medium like a steel bar, both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate while air can sustain only longitudinal waves. The waves on the surface of water are of two kinds: **capillary waves** and **gravity waves**. The former are ripples of fairly short wavelength--no more than a few centimetres--and the restoring force that produces them is the surface tension of water, Gravity waves have wavelengths typically ranging from several metres to several hundred metres. The restoring force that produces these waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep the water surface at its lowest level. The oscillations of the particles in these waves are not confined to the surface only, but extend with diminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The particle motion in the water waves involves a complcated motion; they not only move up and down but also back and forth. The waves in an ocean are a combination of both longitudinal and transverse waves.

It is found that generally transverse and longitudinal waves travel with different speeds in the same medium.

Given below are some examples of wave motion. State in each case if the wave motion is transverse, longitudinal or a combination of both:

* Motion of a kinkin a longitudinal spring produced by displacing one end of the spring sideways.
* Waves produced in a cylinder containing a liquid by moving its piston back and forth.
* Waves produced by a motorbout sailing in water.
* Ultrasonic waves in air produced by a vibrating quartz crystal.

Figure 15.4: A sound wave is set up in an airfilled pipe by moving a piston backand forth. As the oscillations of an element of air are parallel to the direction in which the wave travels, the wave is a longitudinal wave.

### DISPLACEMENT RELATION IN A PROGRESSIVE WAVE

To describe the propagation of a wave in a medium (and the motion of any constituent of the medium), we need a function that completely gives the shape of the wave at every instant of time. For example, to completely describe the wave on a string (and the motion of any element along its length) we need a relation which describes the displacement of an element at a particular position as a function of time and also describes the state of vibration of various elements of the string along its length at a given instant of time. For a sinusoidal wave, as shown in Fig. 15.3, this function should be periodic in space as well as in time. Let \(y\) (\(x\), \(\theta\) denote the transverse displacement of the element at position \(x\) at time \(t\). As the wave sweeps through succeeding elements of the string, the elements oscillate parallel to the \(y\)-axis. At any time \(t\), the displacement \(y\) of the element located at position \(x\) is given by

\[y\left(x,t\right)=a\sin\left(kx-at+\phi\right) \tag{15.2}\]

One can as well choose a cosine function or a linear combination of sine and cosine functions such as,

\[y\left(x,\theta=A\sin\left(kx-at\right)+B\cos\left(kx-at\right),\right. \tag{15.3}\]

then in Eq. (15.2),

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \alpha=\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}\end{array}\]

and \(\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)\)

The function represented in Eq. (15.2) is periodic in position coordinate \(x\) and time \(t\). It represents a transverse wave moving along the \(x\)-axis. At any time \(t\), it gives the displacement of the elements of the string as a function of their position. It can tell us the shape of the wave at any given time and show how the wave progresses. Functions, such as that given in Eq. (15.2), represent a progressive wave travelling along the positive direction of the \(x\)-axis. On the other hand a function,

\[y\left(x,t\right)=a\sin\left(kx+at+\phi\right), \tag{15.4}\]

represents a wave travelling in the negative direction of \(x\)-axis (see Section 15.4). The set of four parameters \(a\), \(\phi\), \(k\), and \(\omega\) in Eq. (15.2) completely describe a harmonic wave. The names of these parameters are displayed in Fig. 15.5 and are defined later.

To understand the definition of the quantities in Eq. (15.2), let us consider the graphs shown in Fig. 15.6. These graphs represent plots of Eq. (15.2) for five different values of time \(t\) as the wave travels in positive direction of \(x\)-axis. A point of maximum positive displacement in a wave, shown by the arrow, is called _crest_, and a point of maximum negative displacement is called **trough**. The progress of the wave is indicated by the progress of the short arrow pointing to a crest of the wave towards the right. As we move from one plot to another, the short arrow moves to the right with the wave shape,

Figure 15.6: Plots of Eq. (15.2) for a wave travelling in the positive direction of an \(x\)-axis at five different values of time \(t\).

Figure 15.5: The names of the quantities in Eq. (15.2) for a progressive wave.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:353]

element of the string at that position moves up and down in simple harmonic motion given by Eq. (15.2) with \(x=0\),

\[y\ (0,\emptyset=a\sin\left(-\omega t\right)\] \[=-\ a\sin\omega t\]

Figure 15.7 is a graph of this equation; it does not show the shape of the wave.

The **period** of oscillation \(T\) of a wave is defined as the time any string element takes to move through one complete oscillation. A typical period is marked on the Fig. 15.7. Applying Eq. (15.2) on both ends of this time interval, we get

\[-a\sin\omega t_{1}=-\ a\sin\omega(t_{1}+T)\] \[=-\ a\sin\left(\omega t_{1}+\omega t\right)\]

This can be true only if the least value of \(\omega t\) is \(2\pi\), or if

\[\omega=2\pi/T \tag{15.7}\]

\(\omega\)is called the **angular frequency** of the wave. Its SI unit is rad \(\mathbf{s}^{-1}\).

Look back at the five plots of a travelling wave in Fig. 15.6. The time between two consecutive plots is \(T/4\). Thus, by the fifth plot, every string element has made one full oscillation.

The **frequency**\(v\) of a wave is defined as \(1/T\) and is related to the angular frequency \(\omega\)by

\[v=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{\omega}{2\pi} \tag{15.8}\]

It is the number of oscillations per unit time made by a string element as the wave passes through it. It is usually measured in hertz.

In the discussion above, reference has always been made to a wave travelling along a string or a transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the displacement of an element of the medium is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function for a longitudinal wave is written as,

\[\mathbf{s}(x,\ \emptyset=a\sin\left(kx-\omega t+\emptyset\right) \tag{15.9}\]

where \(\mathbf{s}(x,t)\) is the displacement of an element of the medium in the direction of propagation of the wave at position \(x\)and time \(t\). In Eq. (15.9), \(a\)is the displacement amplitude; other quantities have the same meaning as in case of a transverse wave except that the displacement function \(y(x,t)\)is to be replaced by the function \(s\left(x,t\right)\).

**Example 15.2**: A wave travelling along a string is described by,

\[y(x,\ \emptyset=0.005\sin\left(80.0\ x-3.0\ \emptyset\right)\]

in which the numerical constants are in SI units [0.005 m, 80.0 rad m\({}^{-1}\), and 3.0 rad s\({}^{-1}\)]. Calculate (a) the amplitude, (b) the wavelength, and (c) the period and frequency of the wave. Also, calculate the displacement \(y\) of the wave at a distance \(x\)=30.0 cm and time \(t\)=20 s?

AnswerOn comparing this displacement equation with Eq. (15.2),

\[y\left(\kappa,\ t\right)=a\sin\left(kx-\omega t\right)\]

we find

1. the amplitude of the wave is 0.005 m = 5 mm.
2. the angular wave number \(k\)and angular frequency \(\omega\)are

\[k=80.0\ \ \text{m}^{-1}\]

and \(\omega=3.0\ \text{s}^{-1}\)

We then relate the wavelength \(\lambda\) to \(k\) through Eq. (15.6),

\[\lambda=2\pi/k\] \[=\frac{2\pi}{80.0\ \text{m}^{-1}}\] \[=7.85\ \text{cm}\]
3. Now we relate \(T\) to \(\omega\)by the relation

\[T=2\pi/\omega\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{2\pi}{3.0\ \text{s}^{-1}}\] \[=2.09\ \text{s}\] and frequency. \(v=1/T=0.48\ \text{Hz}\) The displacement \(y\)at \(x\)=30.0 cm and time \(t=20\ \text{s}\)is given by \[y=\left(0.005\ \text{m}\right)\sin\left(80.0\ x0.3-3.0\ x 20\right)\] \[=\left(0.005\ \text{m}\right)\sin\left(-36+12\pi\right)\] \[=\left(0.005\ \text{m}\right)\sin\left(1.699\right)\] \[=\left(0.005\ \text{m}\right)\sin\left(97^{0}\right)\simeq 5\ \text{mm}\ \

an incident pulse or a wave is somewhat complicated. A part of the wave is reflected and a partis transmitted into the second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely on the boundary between two different media the transmitted wave is called the refracted wave. The incident and refracted waves obey Snell's law of refraction. and the incident and reflected waves obey the usual laws of reflection.

To illustrate the reflection of waves at a boundary, we consider two situations. First, a string is fixed to a rigid wall at its left end, as shown in Fig. 15.11(a). Second, the left end of the string is tied to a ring, which slides up and down without any friction on a rod, as shown in Fig. 15.11(b). A pulse is allowed to propagate in both these strings. the pulse. on reaching the left end, gets reflected; the state of disturbance in the string at various times is shown in Fig. 15.11.

In Fig. 15.11(a). the string is fixed to the wall at its left end. When the pulse arrives at that end, it exerts an upward force on the wall. By Newton's third law, the wall exerts an opposite force of equal magnitude on the string. This second force generates a pulse at the support (the wall). which travels back along the string in the direction opposite to that of the incident pulse. In a reflection of this kind, there must be no displacement at the support as the string is fixed there. The reflected and incident pulses must have opposite signs. so as to cancel each other at that point. Thus, in case of a travelling wave. the reflection at a rigid boundary will take place with a phase reversal or with a phase difference of \(\pi\) or \(180^{\circ}\).

In Fig. 15.11(b). the string is fastened to a ring, which slides without friction on a rod. In this case. when the pulse arrives at the left end, the ring moves up the rod. As the ring moves, it pulls on the string, stretching the string and producing a reflected pulse with the same sign and amplitude as the incident pulse. Thus, in such a reflection, the incident and reflected pulses reinforce each other, creating the

Figure 15.11: (a) A pulse incident from the right is reflected at the left end of the string, which is tied to a wall. Note that the reflected pulse is inverted from the incident pulse. (b) Here the left end is tied to a ring that can slide up and down without friction on the rod. Now the reflected pulse is not inverted by reflection.

maximum displacement at the end of the string: the maximum displacement of the ring is twice the amplitude of either of the pulses. Thus, the reflection is without any additional phase shift. In case of a travelling wave the reflection at an open boundary, such as the open end of an organ pipe, the reflection takes place without any phase change.

We can thus, summarise the reflection of waves at a boundary or interface between two media as follows:

A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

To express the abovestatement mathematically, let the incident wave be represented by

\[y_{j}(x,\,t)=a\sin\,(kx-\alpha t),\]

then, for reflection at a rigid boundary the reflected wave is represented by,

\[y_{j}(x,\,t)=a\sin\,(kx+\alpha t+\pi).\] \[=-\,a\sin\,(kx+\alpha t) \tag{15.35}\]

For reflection at an open boundary, the reflected wave is represented by

\[y,(x,\,t)=a\sin\,(kx+\alpha t). \tag{15.36}\]

#### 15.6.1 Standing Waves and Normal Modes

In the previous section we have considered a system which is bounded at one end. Let us now consider a system which is bounded at both the ends such as a stretched string fixed at the ends or an air column of finite length. In such a system suppose that we send a continuous sinusoidal wave of a certain frequency, say, toward the right. When the wave reaches the right end, it gets reflected and begins to travel back. The left-going wave then overlaps the wave, travelling to the right. When the left-going wave reaches the left end, it gets reflected again and the newly reflected wave begins to travel to the right, overlapping the left-going wave. This process will continue and, therefore, very soon we have many overlapping waves, which interfere with one another. In such a system, at any point \(x\) and at any time \(t\), there are always two waves, one moving to the left and another to the right. We, therefore, have

\[y_{j}(x,\,t)=a\sin\,(kx-\alpha t)\] (wave travelling \[\text{in the positive}\] \[\text{direction of }x\text{-axis}\] )

and \(y_{2}(x,\,t)=a\sin\,(kx+\alpha t)\) (wave travelling \[\text{in the negative}\] \[\text{direction of }x\text{-axis}\] ).

The principle of superposition gives, for the combined wave

\[y(x,\,t)=y_{1}(x,\,t)+y_{2}(x,\,t)\] \[=a\sin\,(kx-\alpha t)+a\sin\,(kx+\alpha t)\] \[=(2a\sin\,kx)\cos\,\alpha t \tag{15.37}\]

The wave represented by Eq. (15.37) does not describe a travellingwave, as the waveform or the disturbance does not move to either side. Here, the quantity \(2a\sin\,kx\) within the brackets is the amplitude of oscillation of the element of the string located at the position \(x\). In a travellingwave, in contrast, the amplitude of the wave is the same for all elements, Equation (15.37), therefore, represents a **standing wave**, a wave in which the waveform does not move. The formation of such waves is illustrated in Fig. 15.12.

It is seen that the points of maximum or minimum amplitude stay at one position.

The amplitude is zero for values of \(kx\) that give \(\sin\,kx=0\). Those values are given by

\[kx=n\,\pi,\text{ for }n=0,1,2,3,...\]

Substituting \(k=2\pi/\lambda\) in this equation, we get

\[x=n\,\frac{\lambda}{2}\,\text{, for }n=0,1,2,3,... \tag{15.38}\]

The positions of zero amplitude are called **nodes**. Note that a distance of \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\) or half a wavelength separates two consecutive nodes.

The amplitude has a maximum value of \(2a\), which occurs for the values of \(kx\) that give \(|\sin\,kx|=1\). Those values are

\[kx=(n+\nu_{2})\,\pi\text{ for }n=0,1,2,3,...\]

Substituting \(k=2\pi/\lambda\) in this equation, we get

\[x=(n+\nu_{2})\frac{\lambda}{2}\,\text{ for }n=0,1,2,3,... \tag{15.39}\]

as the positions of maximum amplitude. These are called the **annodes**. The antinodes are separated by \(\lambda/2\) and are located half way between pairs of nodes.

For a stretched string of length L, fixed at both ends, the two ends of the string have to be nodes.

\[\lambda=\frac{2L}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{ 2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{ \lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\]

If one of the ends is chosen as position \(x=0\), then the other end is \(x=L\). In order that this end is a node; the length \(L\) must satisfy the condition

\[L=n\cdot\frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot \frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda }{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac {\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n} \tag{15.40}\]

This condition shows that standing waves on a string of length \(L\) have restricted wavelength given by

\[\lambda=\frac{2L}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{ \lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n} \cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{ \lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n} \tag{15.41}\]

The frequencies corresponding to these wavelengths follow from Eq. (15.12) as

\[v=n\cdot\frac{v}{2L}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{ \lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n} \cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{ \lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{n} \tag{15.42}\]

where \(v\) is the speed of travelling waves on the string. The set of frequencies given by Eq. (15.42) are called the natural frequencies or modes of oscillation of the system. This equation tells us that the natural frequencies of a string are integral multiples of the lowest frequency \(v=\frac{v}{2L}\), which corresponds to \(n=1\). The oscillation mode with that lowest frequency is called the fundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode with \(n=2\). The third harmonic corresponds to \(n=3\) and so on. The frequencies associated with these modes are often labelled as \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{3}\) and so on. The collection of all possible modes is called the harmonic series and \(n\) is called the harmonic number.

Some of the harmonics of a stretched string fixed at both the ends are shown in Fig. 13. According to the principle of superposition, a stretched string tied at both ends can vibrate simultaneously in more than one modes. Which mode is strongly excited depends on where the

Figure 12: The formation of a standing wave in a stretched string. Two sinusoidal waves of same amplitude travel along the string in opposite directions. The set of pictures represent the state of disp lacements at four different times. The disp lacement at positions marked as \(N\) is zero at all times. These positions are called nodes.

string is plucked or bowed. Musical instruments like sitar and violin are designed on this principle.

We now study the modes of vibration of a system closed at one end, with the other end being free. Air columns such as glass tubes partially filled with water provide examples of such systems. In these, the length of the air column can be adjusted by changing the water level in the tube. In such systems, the end of the air column in touch with the water suffers no displacement as the reflected and incident waves are exactly out of phase. For this reason the pressure changes here are the largest, since when the compressional part is reflected the pressure increase is doubled, and when the rarefaction is reflected the decrease in pressure is doubled. On the other hand, at the open end, there is maximum displacement and minimum pressure change. The two waves travelling in opposite directions are in phase here, so there are no pressure changes. Now if the length of the air column is \(L\), then the open end, \(x=L\), is an antinode and therefore, it follows from Eq. (15.39) that

\[L=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot\cdot\cdot\]

, for \(n=0,1,2,3,...\)

The modes, which satisfy the condition

\[\lambda=\frac{2L}{\left(n+1/2\right)}\cdot\cdot\]

, for \(n=0,1,2,3,...\)

are sustained in such an air column. The corresponding frequencies of various modes of such an air column are given by,

\[v=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot\cdot\frac{v}{2L}\cdot\cdot\]

, for \(n=0,1,2,3,...\)

Some of the normal modes in an air column with the open end are shown in Fig. 15.14. The fundamental frequency is \(\frac{v}{4L}\) and the higher frequencies are odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency, i.e. \(3\cdot\frac{v}{4L}\), \(5\cdot\frac{v}{4L}\), etc.

In the case of a pipe open at both ends, there will be antinodes at both ends, and **all harmonics** will be generated.

Normal modes of a circular membrane rigidly clamped to the circumference as in a tabla are determined by the boundary condition that no

point on the circumference of the membrane vibrates. Estimation of the frequencies of normal modes of this system is more complex. This problem involves wave propagation in two dimensions. However, the underlying physics is the same.

We have seen above that in a string, fixed at both ends, standing waves are produced only at certain frequencies as given by Eq. (15.42) or the system resonates at these frequencies. Similarly an air column open at one end resonates at frequencies given by Eq. (15.44).

**Example 15.5**: A pipe, 30.0 em long, is open at both ends. Which harmonic mode of the pipe rasonates a 1.1 kHz source? Will resonance with the same source be observed if one end of the pipe is closed? Take the speed of sound in air as 330 m s-1.

_Answer_: The first harmonic frequency is given by

\[\nu_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}}-\frac{v}{2L}\quad\quad\mbox{(open pipe)}\]

where \(L\) is the length of the pipe. The frequency of its \(n\)th harmonic is:

\[\nu_{n}=\frac{\cdot}{2L}\,\mbox{, for $n=1.2.3.\...\ \mbox{(open pipe)}$}\]

First few modes of an open pipe are shown in Fig. 15.14.

For \(L=30.0\) cm, \(v=330\) m s-1,

\[\nu_{n}=\frac{n\times 330\ \mbox{(m s-1)}}{0.6\ \mbox{(m)}}=550\ n\ \mbox{s-1}\]

Clearly, a source of frequency 1.1 kHz will resonate at \(\nu_{2}\), i.e. the **second harmonic**.

Now if one end of the pipe is dosed (Fig. 15.15), it follows from Eq. (14.50) that the fundamental frequency is

\[\nu_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}}-\frac{v}{4L}\ \mbox{(pipe closed at one end)}\]

and only the odd numbered harmonics are present :

\[\nu_{3}=\frac{3v}{4L}\,\mbox{, }\nu_{5}=\frac{5v}{4L}\,\mbox{. and so on.}\]

For \(L=30\) cm and \(v=330\) m s-1, the fundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one end is 275 Hz and the source frequency corresponds to its fourth harmonic. Since this harmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance will be observed with the source, the moment one end is closed.

### Beats

If we listen, a few minutes apart, two sounds of very close frequencies, say 256 Hz and 260 Hz, we will not be able to discriminate between

Figure 15.14: Some of the normal modes of vibrationof an air column open at one end.

them. However, if both these sounds reach our ears simultaneously, what we hear is a sound of frequency 258 Hz, the **average** of the two combining frequencies. In addition we hear a striking variation in the intensity of sound -- it increases and decreases in slow, wavering beats that repeat at a frequency of 4 Hz, the difference between the frequencies of two incoming sounds. The phenomenon of wavering of sound intensity when two waves of nearly same frequencies and amplitudes travelling in the same direction, are superimposed on each other is called **beats**.

Let us find out what happens when two waves having slightly different frequencies are superposed on each other. Let the time dependent variations of the displacements due to two sound waves at a particular location be

\[s_{1}=a\,\cos\omega_{1}t\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;s_{2}=a\,\cos\omega_{2}t \tag{15.45}\]

where \(\omega_{2}>\omega_{2}\). We have assumed, for simplicity, that the waves have same amplitude and phase. According to the superposition principle, the resultant displacement is

\[\begin{array}{l}s=s_{1}+s_{2}=a\,\left(\cos\omega_{1}t+\cos\omega_{2}t\right) \\ \cdot\\ =2\,\,a\,\cos\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}1-\omega_{2}\\ 1-\omega_{2}\end{array}\right)t}{2}\,\,\cos\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}1+ \omega_{2}\\ 1+\omega_{2}\end{array}\right)t}{2}\end{array} \tag{15.46}\]

If we write \(\omega_{2}=\frac{\cdot\left(\omega_{2}-\omega_{2}\right)}{2}\) and \(\omega_{2}=\frac{\cdot\left(q+\omega_{2}\right)}{2}\) then Eq. (15.46) can be written as

\[s=\left\{2\,\,a\,\,\cos\omega_{2}t\right\}\,\,\cos\omega_{2}t \tag{15.47}\]

If \(\left|\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}\right|<<\omega_{1}\), \(\omega_{2}\), \(\omega_{2}>>\omega_{2}\), then in Eq. (15.47) the main time dependence arises from cosine function whose angular frequency frequencies is a wave with nearly same angular frequency but its amplitude is not constant. Thus the intensity of resultant sound varies with an angular frequency \(\omega_{sea}=2\omega_{b}=\omega-\omega_{2}\). Now using the relation,

\[\omega=2\pi\nu\]

the beat frequency. \(\nu_{beat}\), is given by

\[\nu_{beat}=\nu_{1}-\nu_{2} \tag{15.48}\]

Thus we hear a waxing and waning of sound with a frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies of the superposing waves. The time-displacement graphs of two waves of frequency 11 Hz and 9 Hz is shown in Figs. 15.16(a) and 15.16(b). The result of their'superposition' is shown in Fig. 15.16(c).

Musicians use the beat phenomenon in tuning their instruments. If an instrument is sounded against a standard frequency and tuned until the beat disappears, then the instrument is in tune with that standard.

**Example 15.6**: Two star strings A and B playing the note '_Dha_' are slightly out of time and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz. The tension of the string B is slightly increased and the beat frequency is found to decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original frequency of B if the frequency of A is 427 Hz?

_Answer_ **Increase in the tension of a string increases its frequency. If the original frequency of B (\(\nu_{a}\)) were greater than that of A (\(\nu_{a}\)), further increase in \(\nu_{a}\) should have resulted in an increase in the beat frequency. But the beat frequency is found to decrease. This shows that \(\nu_{a}<\nu_{a}\). Since \(\nu_{a}-\nu_{b}=5\) Hz, and \(\nu_{a}=427\) Hz, we get \(\nu_{a}=422\) Hz. \(\ll\)

### Doppler Effect

It is an everyday experience that the pitch (or frequency) of the whistle of a fast moving train

Figure 15.16: (a) Plot of a harmonic wave of frequency 11 Hz. (b) Plot of a harmonic wave of frequency 9 Hz. (c) Superposition of (a) and (b), showing clearly the beats in the slow (2 Hz) of the total dis turbulence.

decreases as it recedes away. When we approach a stationary source of sound with high speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to be higher than that of the source. As the observer recedes away from the source, the observed pitch (or frequency) becomes lower than that of the source. This motion-related frequency change is called Doppler effect. The Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler first proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in Holland tested it experimentally in 1845. Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves. However, here we shall consider only sound waves.

We shall analyse changes in frequency under three different situations: (1) observer is stationary but the source is moving, (2) observer is moving but the source is stationary, and (3) both the observer and the source are moving. The situations (1) and (2) differ from each other because of the absence or presence of relative motion between the observer and the medium. Most waves require a medium for their propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do not require any medium for propagation. If there is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are same irrespective of whether the source moves or the observer moves, since there is no way of distinction between the two situations.

#### 15.8.1 Source Moving; Observer Stationary

**Let us choose the convention to take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction of velocity.** Consider a source S moving with velocity \(v_{\rm s}\) and an observer who is stationary in a frame in which the medium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave of angular frequency \(\omega\) and period \(T_{\rm o}\) both measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium, be \(v\). We assume that the observer has a detector that counts every time a wave crest reaches it. As shown in Fig. 15.17, at time \(t=0\) the source is at point \(S_{1}\) located at a distance \(L\) from the observer, and emits a crest. This reaches the observer at time \(t_{1}=L/v\). At time \(t=T_{\rm o}\) the source has moved a distance \(v_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}\) and is at point \(S_{2}\), located at a distance \(\{L+v_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}\}\) from the observer. At \(S_{2}\), the source emits a second crest. This reaches the observer at

\[t_{2} = T_{\rm o}+\frac{\left(L+v_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}\right)}{v}\]

At time \(n\)\(T_{\rm o}\), the source emits its \((n+1)^{\rm th}\) crest and this reaches the observer at time

\[t_{m+1} n T_{\rm o} \frac{L}{v} n_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}\]

Hence, in a time interval

\[nT_{\rm o} \frac{L}{v} nv_{\rm s}T_{\rm o} \frac{L}{v}\]

the observer's detector counts \(n\) crests and the observer records the period of the wave as \(T\) given by

\[T nT_{\rm o} \frac{L}{v} nv_{\rm s}T_{\rm o} \frac{L}{v}/n\] \[.\] \[= T_{\rm o}+\frac{v_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}}{v}\] \[.\] \[= T_{\rm o}\left(1+\frac{v_{\rm s}}{v}\right) \tag{15.49}\]

Equation (15.49) may be rewritten in terms of the frequency \(v_{o}\) that would be measured if the source and observer were stationary, and the frequency \(v\) observed when the source is moving, as.

\[v = v_{\rm o}\left(1+\frac{v_{\rm s}}{v}\right)^{-1} \tag{15.50}\]

If \(v_{\rm s}\) is small compared with the wave speed \(v\), taking binomial expansion to terms in \(\rm fl\,rst\) order in \(v_{\rm s}/v\) and neglecting higher power, Eq. (15.50) may be approximated, giving

\[v = v_{\rm o}\left(1-\frac{v_{\rm s}}{v}\right) \tag{15.51}\]

For a source approaching the observer, we replace \(v_{\rm s}\) by \(-v_{\rm s}\) to get

Figure 15.17: A source moving with velocity \(v_{\rm s}\) emits a wave crest at the point \(S_{1}\). It emits the next wave crest at \(S_{2}\) after moving a distance \(v_{\rm s}T_{\rm o}\).

\[v\ =\ v_{0}\left(1+\frac{v_{s}}{v}\right) \tag{15.52}\]

The observer thus measures a lower frequency when the source recedes from him than he does when it is at rest. He measures a higher frequency when the source approaches him.

#### 15.8.2 Observer Moving; Source Stationary

Now to derive the Doppler shift when the observer is moving with velocity \(v_{o}\) towards the source and the source is at rest. we have to proceed in a different manner. We work in the reference frame of the moving observer. In this reference frame the source and medium are approaching at speed \(v_{o}\) and the speed with which the wave approaches is \(v_{o}+v\). Following a similar procedure as in the previous case, we find that the time interval between the arrival of the first and the _(n+1)_ th crests is

\[t_{n+1}-t_{i}\ =\ n\ T_{0}-\frac{nv_{0}T_{0}}{v_{0}+v}\]

The observer thus. measures the period of the wave to be

\[\cdot\] \[-\ T_{0}\left(1-\frac{v_{0}}{v_{0}+v}\right)\] \[\cdot\] \[T_{0}\ \ \ 1\ \ \ \frac{v_{0}}{v}\]

giving

\[\cdot\] \[v\ =\ \ \ _{0}\left(1+\frac{v_{0}}{v}\right) \tag{15.53}\]

If \(\frac{v_{0}}{v}\) is small. the Doppler shift is almost same whether it is the observer or the source moving since Eq. (15.53) and the approximate relation Eq. (15.51 ) are the same.

#### 15.8.3 Both Source and Observer Moving

We will now derive a general expression for Doppler shift when both the source and the observer are moving. As before. let us take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction. Let the source and the observer be moving with velocities \(v_{s}\) and \(v_{o}\) respectively as shown in Fig.15.18. Suppose at time \(t=0\). the observer is at \(O_{1}\) and the source is at \(S_{1}\). \(O_{1}\) being to the left of \(S_{1}\). The source emits a wave of velocity \(v\). of frequency \(v\) and period \(T_{0}\) all measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium. Let \(L\) be the distance between \(O_{1}\) and \(S_{1}\) at \(t=0\). when the source emits the first crest. Now, since the observer is moving, the velocity of the wave relative to the observer is \(v+v_{0}\). The force the first crest reaches the observer at time \(t_{1}=L/(v+v_{0})\). At time \(t=T_{0}\) both the observer and the source have moved to their new positions \(O_{2}\) and \(S_{2}\) respectively. The new distance between the observer and the source. \(O_{2}\)\(S_{2}\), would be \(L+(v_{s}-v_{0})\ T_{0}|\). At \(S_{2}\), the source emits a second crest. This reaches the observer at time.

\[t_{2}=T_{o}+\left[L+\{v_{s}-v_{o}\}T_{o}\right]\ /(v+v_{o})\]

At time \(nT_{o}\) the source emits its \((n+1)\) th crest and this reaches the observer at time

\[t_{n+1}=nT_{o}+\left[L+n\left(v_{s}-v_{o}\right)T_{o}\right]\ /(v+v_{o})\]

Hence, in a time interval \(t_{n+1}-t_{1}\), i. e.,

\[nT_{o}+\left[L+n\{v_{s}-v_{o}\}T_{o}\right]\ /(v+v_{o})-L\ /(v+v_{o}),\]

the observer counts \(n\) crests and the observer records the period of the wave as equal to \(T\) given by

Summary

1. _Mechanical waves_ can exist in material media and are governed by Newton's Laws.
2. _Transverse waves_ are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
3. _Longitudinal waves_ are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the direction of wave propagation.
4. _Progressive wave_ is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.
5. _The displacement_ in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given by \(y\left\{x,\ \theta=a\sin\left\{kx-\omega+\phi\right.\right.\) where _ais the_ amplitude of the wave. \(k\) is the angular wave number, _\(\omega\)is the_ angular frequency. \(\left\{kx-\omega+\phi\right\}\) is the phase. _and_\(\phi\)is the_ phase constant or phase angle.
6. _Wavelength_ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave. it is twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or anti nodes.
7. _Period T_ of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the _angular frequency_\(\omega\) through the relation \(\cdot\) \(T-\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\)
8. _Frequency_\(v\) of a wave is defined as \(1/T\) and is related to angular frequency by \(\cdot\) \(f-\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\).
9. _Speed_ of a progressive wave is given by \(v\)\(\overline{k}\)\(\overline{T}\)
10. _The speed of a transverse wave_ on a stretched string is set by the properties of the string. The speed on a string with tension \(T\) and linear mass density \(\mu\) is \(\upsilon=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\)
11. _Sound waves_ are longitudinal mechanical waves that can travel through solid s. liquids, or gases. The speed of sound wave in a fluid having bulk modulus B and density \(\rho\) is \(\cdot\) \(\upsilon=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}\) The speed of longitudinal waves in a metallic bar is \(\cdot\) \(\upsilon=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho}}\) For gases. since \(B=\gamma P\). the speed of sound is \(\cdot\) \(\upsilon=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}\)When two or more waves traverse the same medium, the displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to each wave. This is known as the _principle of superposition_ of waves

\[y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x\ -\ vt)\]

Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit _interference_, adding or cancelling according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same direction and have the same amplitude \(a\) and frequency but differ in phase by a _phase constant_\(\phi\) the result is a single wave with the same frequency \(\omega\):

\[y\ (x,\ t)\ =\ 2\ a\cos{\frac{1}{2}}\ \ \ \sin\ \ \kappa x\ \ \ \ t\ \ \ \ \frac{1}{2}\]

If \(\phi=0\) or an integral multiple of \(2\pi\), the waves are exactly in phase and the interference is constructive: if \(\phi=\pi\), they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.

A travellingwave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

For an incident wave

\[y,\ |x,\ \theta=a\sin\ (kx-a\ t)\]

the reflected wave at a rigid boundary is

\[y,\ |x,\ \theta=-\ a\sin\ (kx+a\ t)\]

For reflection at an open boundary

\[y,\ |x,\ t)=a\sin\ (kx+\omega\theta\]

The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces _standing waves_. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by

\[y\ (x,\ \theta=|2a\sin\ \kappa x|\cos\ \omega\]

Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called _nodes_ and fixed locations of maximum displacements called _antiroades_. The separation between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is \(\lambda/2\).

A stretched string of length \(L\) fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by

\[v\ \ -\frac{1}{2}\ \ \frac{v}{2L},\ \ \ \ \ n=1,\ 2,\ 3,\...\]

The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the _normal modes_ of oscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the _fundamental mode_ or the _first harmonic_. The _second harmonic_ is the oscillation mode with \(n=2\) and so on.

A pipe of length \(L\) with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns) vibrates with frequencies given by

\[v\ \ \ n\ \ \frac{v}{2L},\ \ \ \ \ n=0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\...\]

The set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the _normal modes_ of oscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by \(v/4L\) is the fundamental mode or the first harmonic.

A string of length \(L\) fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open at the other end, vibrates with frequencies called its normal modes. Each of these frequencies is a _resonant frequency_ of the system.

Bears arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) and comparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is

\[v_{\rm{long}}=v_{1}\ \sim v_{2}\]18. The _Doppler effect_ is a change in the observed frequency of a wave when the source and the observer O moves relative to the medium. For sound the observed frequency \(v\) is given in terms of the source frequency \(v_{a}\) by \[v=v_{a}\left(\frac{v+v_{0}}{v+v_{\mathbf{S}}}\right)\] here \(v\) is the speed of sound through the medium, \(v_{a}\) is the velocity of observer relative to the medium, and \(v_{\mathbf{s}}\) is the source velocity relative to the medium. In using this formula, velocities in the direction OS should be treated as positive and those opposite to it should be taken to be negative.

POINTS TO PODER

1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium. A wind is different from the sound wave in air. The former involves motion of air from one place to the other. The latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.
2. In a wave, energy and _not the matter_ is transferred from one point to the other.
3. Energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.
4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity, Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all media, solids, liquids and gases.
5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency all particles have the same amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time. In a stationary wave, all particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different amplitudes.
6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that medium (\(v\)) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.
7. For an observer moving with velocity \(v_{a}\)relative to the medium, the speed of a wave is obviously different from \(v\) and is given by \(v\pm v_{a}\).

## Chapter 6 Mechanical Properties of Solids

### 6.1 Introduction

In Chapter 7, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then realised that the motion of a body depends on how mass is distributed within the body. We restricted ourselves to simpler situations of rigid bodies. A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.

As solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. If you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as **elasticity** and the deformation caused is known as **elastic** deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such substances are called **plastic** and this property is called **plasticity.** Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.

The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in engineering design. For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential. The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc. One could also ask -- Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but sufficiently strong? Can we design an artificial limb which is lighter but stronger? Why does a railway track have a particular shape like \(\Pi\)? Why is glass brittle while brass is not? Answers to such questions begin with the study of how relatively simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform different solids bodies. In this chapter, we shall study theelastic behaviour and mechanical properties of solids which would answer many such questions.

### Elastic Behaviour of Solids

We know that in a solid, each atom or molecule is surrounded by neighbouring atoms or molecules. These are bonded together by interatomic or intermolecular forces and stay in a stable equilibrium position. When a solid is deformed, the atoms or molecules are displaced from their equilibrium positions causing a change in the interatomic (or intermolecular) distances. When the deforming force is removed, the interatomic forces tend to drive them back to their original positions. Thus the body regains its original shape and size. The restoring mechanism can be visualised by taking a model of spring-ball system shown in the Fig. 9. Here the balls represent atoms and springs represent interatomic forces.

If you try to displace any ball from its equilibrium position, the spring system tries to restore the ball back to its original position. Thus elastic behaviour of solids can be explained in terms of microscopic nature of the solid. Robert Hooke, an English physicist (1635 - 1703 A.D) performed experiments on springs and found that the elongation (change in the length) produced in a body is proportional to the applied force or load. In 1676, he presented his law of elasticity, now called Hooke's law. We shall study about it in Section 9.4. This law, like Boyle's law, is one of the earliest quantitative relationships in science. It is very important to know the behaviour of the materials under various kinds of load from the context of engineering design.

### Stress and Strain

When a force is applied on body, it is deformed to a small or large extent depending upon the nature of the material of the body and the magnitude of the deforming force. The deformation may not be noticeable visually in many materials but it is there. When a body is subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is developed in the body. This restoring force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the applied force. The restoring force per unit area is known as **stress.** If \(F\) is the force applied and \(A\) is the area of cross section of the body,

Magnitude of the stress = \(F/A\) (9.1)

The SI unit of stress is N m-2 or pascal (Pa) and its dimensional formula is [ ML-1T-2 ].

There are three ways in which a solid may change its dimensions when an external force acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 9.2. In Fig.9.2(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area. The restoring force per unit area in this case is called **tensile stress.** If the cylinder is compressed under the action of applied forces, the restoring force per unit area is known as **compressive stress.** Tensile or compressive stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.

In both the cases, there is a change in the length of the cylinder. The change in the length \(\Delta L\) to the original length \(L\) of the body (cylinder in this case) is known as **longitudinal strain**.

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{ Longitudinal strain}\end{array}\]

However, if two equal and opposite deforming forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2(b), there is relative displacement between the opposite faces of the cylinder. The restoring force per unit area developed due to the applied tangential force is known as **tangential or shearing stress**.

**Robert Hooke**

**(1635 - 1703 A.D.)**

Robert Hooke was born on July 18, 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight. He was one of the most brilliant and versatile seventeenth century English scientists. He attended Oxford University but never graduated. Yet he was an extremely talented inventor, instrument-maker and building designer. He assisted Robert Boyle in the construction of Boylean air pump. In 1662, he was appointed as Curator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society. In 1665, he became Professor of Geometry in Gresham College where he carried out his astronomical observations. He built a Gregorian reflecting telescope; discovered the fifth star in the trapezium and an asterism in the constellation Orion: suggested that Jupiter rotates on its axis; plotted detailed sketches of Mars which were later used in the 19\({}^{\rm th}\) century to determine the planet's rate of rotation; stated the inverse square law to describe planetary motion, which Newton modified later etc. He was elected Fellow of Royal Society and also served as the Society's Secretary from 1667 to 1682. In his series of observations presented in Micrographia, he suggested wave theory of light and first used the word 'cell' in a biological context as a result of his studies of cork.

Robert Hooke is best known to physicists for his discovery of law of elasticity: Ut tension, sic vis (This is a Latin expression and it means as the distortion, so the force). This law laid the basis for studies of stress and strain and for understanding the elastic materials.

**As a result of applied tangential force, there is a relative displacement \(\Delta x\) between opposite faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2(b). The strain so produced is known as shearing strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative displacement of the faces \(\Delta x\) to the length of the cylinder \(L\).**

**Shearing strain**

\[\frac{x}{L}=\tan\theta \tag{9.3}\]

where \(\theta\) is the angular displacement of the cylinder from the vertical (original position of the cylinder). Usually \(\theta\) is very small, \(\tan\theta\) is nearly equal to angle \(\theta\), (if \(\theta=10^{\circ}\), for example, there is only 1% difference between \(\theta\) and \(\tan\theta\)).

**Fig. 9.2**: _(a) Cylinder subjected to tensile stress stretches it by an amount \(\Delta L\). (b) A cylinder subjected to shearing (tangential) stress deforms by an angle \(\theta\).(c) A book subjected to a shearing stress (d) A solid sphere subjected to a uniform hydraulic stress shrinks in volume by an amount \(\Delta V\)._

**Fig. 9.3**: _(a) Cylinder subjected to tensile stress stretches it by an amount \(\Delta L\). (b) A cylinder subjected to shearing (tangential) stress deforms by an angle \(\theta\).(c) A book subjected to a shearing stress (d) A solid sphere subjected to a uniform hydraulic stress shrinks in volume by an amount \(\Delta V\)._is known as **hydraulic stress** and in magnitude is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force per unit area).

The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure is called **volume strain** and is defined as the ratio of change in volume (\(\Delta V\)) to the original volume (\(V\)).

Volume strain \(\dfrac{V}{V}\) (9.5)

Since the strain is a ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, it has no units or dimensional formula.

### Hooke's law

**Stress and strain take different forms in the situations depicted in the Fig. (9.2). For small deformations the stress and strain are proportional to each other. This is known as Hooke's law. Thus, stress \(\approx\) strain stress \(\approx\) \(k\times\) strain (9.6)

where \(k\) is the proportionality constant and is known as modulus of elasticity.

Hooke's law is an empirical law and is found to be valid for most materials. However, there are some materials which do not exhibits this linear relationship.

### stress-strain curve

The relation between the stress and the strain for a given material under tensile stress can be found experimentally. In a standard test of tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is stretched by an applied force. The fractional change in length (the strain) and the applied force needed to cause the strain are recorded. The applied force is gradually increased in steps and the change in length is noted. A graph is plotted between the stress (which is equal in magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal is shown in Fig. 9.3. Analogous graphs for compression and shear stress may also be obtained. The stress-strain curves vary from material to material. These curves help us to understand how a given material deforms with increasing loads. From the graph, we can see that in the region between O to A, the curve is linear. In this region, Hooke's law is obeyed. The body regains its original dimensions when the applied force is removed. In this region, the solid behaves as an elastic body.

In the region from A to B, stress and strain are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still returns to its original dimension when the load is removed. The point B in the curve is known as **yield point** (also known as **elastic limit**) and the corresponding stress is known as **yield strength** (\(S_{y}\)) of the material.

If the load is increased further, the stress developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the stress. The portion of the curve between B and D shows this. When the load is removed, say at some point C between B and D, the body does not regain its original dimension. In this case, even when the stress is zero, the strain is not zero. The material is said to have a **permanent set**. The deformation is said to be **plastic deformation**. The point D on the graph is the ultimate **tensile strength** (\(S_{u}\)) of the material. Beyond this point, additional strain is produced even by a reduced applied force and fracture occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and fracture points D and E are close, the material is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the material is said to be ductile.

As stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour varies from material to material. For example, rubber can be pulled to several times its original length and still returns to its original shape. Fig. 9.4 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that although elastic region is very large, the material

Figure 9.3: A typical stress-strain curve for a metal.

does not obey Hooke's law over most of the region. Secondly, there is no well defined plastic region. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains are called **elastomers**.

### Elastic Moduli

The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 3) is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio of stress and strain, called **modulus of elasticity**. is found to be a characteristic of the material.

#### Young's Modulus

Experimental observation show that for a given material, the magnitude of the strain produced is same whether the stress is tensile or compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress (\(\sigma\)) to the longitudinal strain (\(\epsilon\)) is defined as **Young's modulus** and is denoted by the symbol \(Y\).

\[Y=\ - \tag{9.7}\]

From Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have

\[\begin{array}{l}Y=\left\{F/A\right\}/(\Delta L/L)\\ =\left\{F\times L\right\}/(A\times\Delta L)\end{array} \tag{9.8}\]

Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the unit of Young's modulus is the same as that of stress _Le._, N m=2 or Pascal [Pa]. Table 9.1 gives the values of Young's moduli and yield strengths of some materials.

From the data given in Table 9.1, it is noticed that for metals Young's moduli are large. Therefore, these materials require a large force to produce small change in length. To increase the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm\({}^{2}\) cross-sectional area by 0.1%. a force of 2000 N is required. The force required to produce the same strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N. 900 N and 1100 N respectively. It means that steel is more elastic than copper, brass and aluminium. It is for this reason that steel is

large compressibilities, which vary with pressure and temperature. The incompressibility of the solids is primarily due to the tight coupling between the neighbouring atoms. The molecules in liquids are also bound with their r neighbours but not as strong as in solids. Molecules in gases are very poorly coupled to their neighbours.

### Applications of Elastic Behaviour of Materials

The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in everyday life. All engineering designs require precise knowledge of the elastic behaviour of materials. For example while designing a building, the structural design of the columns, beams and supports require knowledge of strength of materials used. Have you ever thought why the beams used in construction of bridges, as supports etc. have a cross-section of the type \(\mathbf{P}\) Why does a heap of sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape? Answers to these questions can be obtained from the study of structural engineering which is based on concepts developed here.

Cranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads from one place to another have a thick metal rope to which the load is attached. The rope is pulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we want to make a crane, which has a lifting capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope be? We obviously want that the load does not deform the rope permanently. Therefore, the extension should not exceed the elastic limit. From Table 9.1. we find that mild steel has a yield strength (\(S_{y}\)) of about \(300\times 10^{6}\) N m\({}^{2}\). Thus, the area of cross-section (A) of the rope should at least be

\[\begin{array}{l}A\geq W/S_{y}=Mg/S_{y}\\ =(10^{4}\text{ kg}\times 10\text{ m s}^{2})/(300\times 10^{6}\text{ N m}^{2})\\ =3.3\times 10^{4}\text{ m}^{2}\end{array}\]

corresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a rope of circul ar cross-section. Generally a large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together, like in pitfalls, for ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength.

A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings use of beams and columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 9.8. A bar of length \(l\), breadth \(b\), and depth \(d\) when loaded at the centre by a load \(W\) sags by an amount given by

\[\delta=W\l^{3}/(4bd^{3}Y) \tag{9.16}\]

This relation can be derived using what you have already learnt and a little calculus. From Eq. (9.16), we see that to reduce the bending for a given load, one should use a material with a large Young's modulus \(Y\). For a given material, increasing the depth \(d\) rather than the breadth \(b\) is more effective in reducing the bending, since \(\delta\) is proportional to \(d^{-3}\) and only to \(b^{-1}\)(of course the length \(l\) of the span should be as small as possible). But on increasing the depth, unless the load is exactly at the right place (diffleult to arrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the deep bar may bend as shown in Fig. 9.9(b). This is called buckling. To avoid this, a common compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown in Fig. 9.9(c). This section provides a large load-bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending. This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the strength and hence reduces the cost.

Figure 9.9: Different cross-sectional shapes of a beam. (a) Rectangular section of a bar. (b) A thin bar and how it can buckle (c) Commonly used section for a load bearing bar.

Figure 9.8: A beam supported at the ends and loaded at the centre.

Use of pillars or columns is al so very common in buildings and bridges. A pillar with rounded ends as shown in Fig. 9.10(a) supports less load than that with a distributed shape at the ends [Fig. 9.10(b)]. The precise design of a bridge or a building has to take into account the conditions under which it will function, the cost and long period, reliability of usable materials etc.

The answer to the question why the maximum height of a mountain on earth is \(\sim\)10 km can also be provided by considering the elastic properties of rocks. A mountain base is not under uniform compression and this provides some shearing stress to the rocks under which they can flow. The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks flow.

At the bottom of a mountain of height \(h\), the force per unit area due to the weight of the mountain is \(hpg\) where \(\rho\) is the density of the material of the mountain and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The material at the bottom experiences this force in the vertical direction, and the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression. There is a shear component, approximately \(hpg\) itself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is \(30\times\,10^{7}\) N m\({}^{2}\). Equating this to \(hpg\), with \(\rho\) = 3 \(\times\,10^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\) gives \(hpg\) = 30 \(\times\,10^{7}\) N m\({}^{2}\). Or \(h\) = 30\(\times\,10^{7}\) N m\({}^{2}\)/(3 \(\times\,10^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\)\(\times\,10\) m s\({}^{2}\)) = 10 km which is more than the height of Mt. Everest!

SUMMARY

1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension. In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress -- longitudinal stress (associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression), (b) shearing stress. and (c) hydraulic stress.
2. For small deformations. stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials. This is known as Hooke's law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of elasticity. Three elastic moduli \(viz\), Youngs modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces that act on them. A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke's law.
3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke's law takes the form \(F/A\) = \(Y\Delta L/L\) where \(\Delta L/L\) is the tensile or compressive strain of the object. \(F\) is the magnitude of the applied force causing the strain. \(A\) is the cross-sectional area over which \(F\) is applied (perpendicular to \(A\)) and \(Y\) is the Youngs modulus for the object. The stress is \(F/A\).
4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement \(\Delta L\)of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height \(L\) This type of deformation is called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is possible only in solids. In this kind of deformation the Hooke's law takes the form \(F/A\) = \(G\times\Delta L/L\) where \(\Delta L\)is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force \(F\), and \(G\) is the shear modulus.

**5.** **When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding fluid, the Hooke's law takes the form** \(p=B\left(\Delta V/V\right)\)**.** **where** \(p\) **is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid.** \(\Delta V/V\) **(the volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object's volume due to that pressure and** \(B\) **is the bulk modulus of the object.**

**POINTS TO PODER**

1. **In the case of a wire, suspended from ceiling and stretched under the action of a weight (**F**) suspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is equal and opposite to the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section** \(A\) **of the wire is just** \(F\) **and not** \(2F\)**. Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to** \(F/A\)**.**
2. **Hooke's law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve.**
3. **The Young's modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids have lengths and shapes.**
4. **Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases. It refers to the change in volume when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body remains unchanged.**
5. **Metals have larger values of Young's modulus than alloys and elastomers.** \(A\) **material with large value of Young's modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its length.**
6. **In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered to be more elastic.**
7. **In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions also.The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described by just one elastic constant. For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).**
8. **Stress is not a vector quantity since, unlike a force, the stress cannot be assigned a specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a specified side of a section has a definite direction.**

## Chapter 1 Introduction

All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything that does not move or change with time. _Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges_.

### 1.2 Electric Charge

Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece, around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word _elektron_ meaning _amber_. Many such pairs of materials were known whichwool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat's fur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.

If a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls (now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon thread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled by the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a glass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with plastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f)].

These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of an entity which is called the _electric charge_. We say that the bodies like glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire an electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested that there are two kinds of electrification and we find that (i) _like charges repel_ and (ii) _unlike charges attract_ each other. The experiments also demonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith balls on contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged by contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called the _polarity_ of charge.

When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light objects as they did on being electrified.

Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects

Figure 1.1: Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other.

neutralise or nullify each other's effect. Therefore the charges were named as _positive_ and _negative_ by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin. We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of the same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat's fur is called positive and that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be neutral.

## 2 Detection of Electrified and Charges

In olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity dealt with charges on glass rods, cat's fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism described interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish scientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current through a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets generate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell and the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the interdependence of these two subjects. This field is called _electromagnetism_. Most of the phenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually every force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the matter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living organisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature.

Maxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism as Newton's equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued that light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely electric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately related to that of electricity and magnetism.

The science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological civilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety of the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science. Although charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the frame of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You know that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance between the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as the square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter that electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force by several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).

A simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the _gold-leaf_ electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergence is an indicator of the amount of charge.

Students can make a simple electroscope as follows [Fig. 2(b)]: Take a thin aluminium curtain rod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain. Cut out a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at one end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle that can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the opening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork sufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the rod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on the lower side and ball end projecting above the cork. Fold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in length) in the middle and attach it to the flattened end of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves of your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with about 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork. A paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance to measure the separation of leaves. The separation is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the electroscope.

To understand how the electroscope works, use the white paper strips we used for seeing the attraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half so that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and iron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown in Fig. 2. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold. You would notice that the two halves move apart. This shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold it into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each other. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the curtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is transferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the halves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The divergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let us first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.

You know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the materials are electrically neutral, they do contain charges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is therefore essential that we learn more about such a force.

To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids, some of the electrons, being less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred from one body to the other. A body can thus be charged positively by losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively

Figure 3: Paper strip experiment.

by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the material body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material body can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when a body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why we have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing the bodies.

### 3 Conductors and Insulators

A metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of being charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging. Suppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pitch ball and the other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the pitch ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated with a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take place from the plastic rod to the pitch ball. Why does the transfer of charge not take place from the rod to the ball?

Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others do not. Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are called _conductors_. They have electric charges (electrons) that are comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass, porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of electricity through them. They are called _insulators_. Most substances fall into one of the two classes stated above1.

Footnote 1: There is a third category called _semiconductors_, which offer resistance to the movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and insulators.

When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn why this happens in the next chapter.

This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity.

When we bring a charged body in contact with the earth, all the excess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current to pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our body). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called _grounding or earthing_. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical circuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth and thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are used in buildings for the purpose of earthing near the mains supply. The electric wiring in our houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry electric current from the power station and the third is earthed by connecting it to the buried metal plate. Metallic bodies of the electric appliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the earth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body, the charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without causing any injury to the humans; this would have otherwise been unavoidable since the human body is a conductor of electricity.

### 4 Charging by Induction

When we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the negative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also gets charged. Thus the pith ball is _charged by contact_. It is then repelled by the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely charged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is a question we have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be happening by performing the following experiment.

1. [label=()]
2. Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands, in contact as shown in Fig. 4.1(a).
3. Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking care that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres are attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge on the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in the metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4.1(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an excess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an excess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres have accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge starts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled by these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of force of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the accumulated charges. Fig. 4.1(b) shows the equilibrium situation. The process is called _induction of charge_ and happens almost instantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown, till the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the charges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to their original neutral state.
4. Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still held near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 4.1(c). The two spheres are found to be oppositely charged and attract each other.
5. Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as shown in Fig. 4.1(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The charges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in Fig. 4.1(e).

In this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely charged. This is _charging by induction_. The positively charged glass rod does not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by contact.

When electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect takes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of the objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.

Figure 4: Charging by induction.

[This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The mechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and 2.10.] The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated. We know that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However, the magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges and in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion. As a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are pulled towards the rods.

**Example 1.1**: How can you charge a metal sphere positively without touching it?

**Solution** Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an insulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the metallic sphere, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b). As the rod is brought close to the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to repulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes positively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the metal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting wire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges at the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of the negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect the sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be held at the near end [Fig. 1.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The positive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in Fig. 1.5(e).

In this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process of induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge.

Similar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively by induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this case the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the sphere is connected to the ground with a wire. Can you explain why?

### 1.5 Basic Properties of Electric Charge

We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each other. Here, we shall now describe some other properties of the electric charge.

If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them, we treat them as _point charges_. All the charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point in space.

#### 1.5.1 Additivity of charges

We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\), the total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\),.i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains \(n\) charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\),..., \(q_{n}\), then the total charge of the system is \(q_{1}\) + \(q_{2}\) + \(q_{3}\) +... + \(q_{n}\). Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to the mass. However, there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, -3, +4 and -5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (-3) + (+4) + (-5) = -1 in the same unit.

#### 1.5.2 Charge is conserved

We have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses. Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may _get_ redistributed but it is found that _the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved_. Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.

It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after the creation.

#### 1.5.3 Quantisation of charge

Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge denoted by \(e\). Thus charge \(q\) on a body is always given by

\(q=ne\)where \(n\) is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written as \(-e\) and that on a proton as \(+e\).

The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of \(e\) is termed as _quantisation of charge_. There are a large number of situations in physics where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by Millikan in 1912.

In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a _coulomb_ and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2 of Class XI, Physics Textbook, Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of charge is

\(e=1.602192\times 10^{-19}\) C

Thus, there are about \(6\times 10^{18}\) electrons in a charge of \(-1\)C. In electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered and hence we use smaller units \(1\,\mu\)C (micro coulomb) = \(10^{-6}\) C or \(1\) mC (milli coulomb) = \(10^{-3}\) C.

If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of \(e\). Thus, if a body contains \(n_{1}\) electrons and \(n_{2}\) protons, the total amount of charge on the body is \(n_{2}\times e+n_{1}\times\left<\left<e\right>\right.=\left(n_{2}-n_{3}\right>e\). Since \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an integral multiple of \(e\) and can be increased or decreased also in steps of \(e\).

The step size \(e\) is, however, very small because at the macroscopic level, we deal with charges of a few \(\mu\)C. At this scale the fact that charge of a body can increase or decrease in units of \(e\) is not visible. The grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.

This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.

At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous compared to the magnitude of charge \(e\). Since \(e=1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C, a charge of magnitude, say \(1\,\mu\)C, contains something like \(10^{13}\) times the electronic charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in units of \(e\) is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no practical consequence and can be ignored. At the microscopic level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds of \(e\), i.e.,they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the scale involved that is very important.

**Example 1.2**: If \(10^{9}\) electrons move out of a body to another body every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C on the other body?

**Solution** In one second \(10^{9}\) electrons move out of the body. Therefore the charge given out in one second is \(1.6\times 10^{-19}\times 10^{9}\) C = \(1.6\times 10^{-10}\) C. The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated to be \(1\) C \(\div(1.6\times 10^{-10}\) C/s) = \(6.25\times 10^{9}\) s = \(6.25\times 10^{9}\) \(\div(365\ \times 24\times 3600)\) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb, from a body from which \(10^{9}\) electrons move out every second, we will need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large unit for many practical purposes.

It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about \(2.5\times 10^{24}\) electrons.

**Example 1.3**: How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water?

**Solution** Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is 250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole (= 6.02 \(\times\)\(10^{23}\) molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of molecules in one cup of water is \((250/18)\times 6.02\times 10^{23}\).

Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to \((250/18)\times 6.02\times 10^{23}\times 10\times 1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C = \(1.34\times 10^{7}\) C.

### Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law is a quantitative statement about the force between two point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the charged bodies are treated as _point charges_. Coulomb measured the force between two point charges and found that _it varied inversely as the square of the distance between the charges and was directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and acted along the line joining the two charges_. Thus, if two point charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\) are separated by a distance \(r\) in vacuum, the magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by

\[F=k\ \ \frac{\left|q_{1}\ q_{2}\right|}{r^{2}} \tag{1.1}\]

How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is \(q\). If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will be \(q/2\)*. Repeating this process, we can get charges \(q/2\), \(q/4\), etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and measured the force for different separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).

Footnote *: Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation: two charges (\(q/2\) each) add up to make a total charge \(q\).

Coulomb's law, a simple mathematical statement, was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner described above. While the original experiments established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to subatomic level (\(r\sim 10^{-10}\) m).

Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the _explicit_ magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round: Coulomb's law can _now_ be employed to furnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), \(k\)is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive value of \(k\). The choice of \(k\) determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the value of \(k\) is about \(9\times 10^{9}\). The unit of charge that results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of \(k\) in Eq. (1.1), we see that for \(q_{1}=q_{2}=1\) C, \(r=1\) m

\(F=9\times 10^{9}\) N

That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude _in vacuum_ experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude \(9\times 10^{9}\) N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 m.

The constant \(k\) in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as \(k=1/4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\) for later convenience, so that Coulomb's law is written as

\[F=\frac{1}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}}\quad\frac{\left|q_{1}\,q_{2}\right|}{r^{ 2}} \tag{1.2}\]

\(\varepsilon_{0}\) is called the _permittivity of free space_. The value of \(\varepsilon_{0}\) in SI units is

\(\varepsilon_{0}=8.854\times 10^{-12}\) C\({}^{2}\) N\({}^{1}\)-m\({}^{2}\)Since force is a vector, it is better to write Coulomb's law in the vector notation. Let the position vectors of charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) be \(\textbf{r}_{1}\) and \(\textbf{r}_{2}\) respectively [see Fig.1.6(a)]. We denote force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{2}\) by \(\textbf{F}_{12}\) and force on \(q_{2}\) due to \(q_{1}\) by \(\textbf{F}_{21}\). The two point charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) have been numbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is denoted by \(\textbf{r}_{21}\):

\[\textbf{r}_{21}=\textbf{r}_{2}-\textbf{r}_{1}\]

In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by \(\textbf{r}_{12}\):

\[\textbf{r}_{12}=\textbf{r}_{1}-\textbf{r}_{2}=-\textbf{r}_{21}\]

The magnitude of the vectors \(\textbf{r}_{21}\) and \(\textbf{r}_{12}\) is denoted by \(r_{21}\) and \(r_{12}\), respectively (\(r_{12}\)= \(r_{21}\)). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit vector along the vector. To denote the direction from 1 to 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:

\[\dot{\textbf{r}}_{21}=\frac{\textbf{r}_{21}}{r_{21}}\,\ \dot{\textbf{r}}_{2 2}=\frac{\textbf{r}_{21}}{r_{12}},\ \ \ \dot{\textbf{r}}_{21}=\dot{\textbf{r}}_{12}\]

Coulomb's force law between two point charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) located at \(\textbf{r}_{1}\) and \(\textbf{r}_{2}\) is then expressed as

\[\textbf{F}_{21}=\frac{1}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}}\ \frac{q_{1}\,q_{2}}{r_{21}^{2}} \ \ \dot{\textbf{r}}_{21} \tag{3}\]

Some remarks on Eq. (3) are relevant:

* Equation (3) is valid for any sign of \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) whether positive or negative. If \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) are of the same sign (either both positive or both negative), \(\textbf{F}_{21}\) is along \(\dot{\textbf{r}}_{21}\), which denotes repulsion, as it should be for like charges. If \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) are of opposite signs, \(\textbf{F}_{21}\) is along \(\dot{-\dot{\textbf{r}}}_{21}\)(\(\dot{-\dot{\textbf{r}}}_{12}\)), which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike charges. Equation (3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.6(b)].
* The force \(\textbf{F}_{12}\) on charge \(q_{1}\) due to charge \(q_{2}\), is obtained from Eq. (3), by simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e., \(\cdot\) \(\textbf{F}_{12}=\frac{1}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}}\ \frac{q_{1}\,q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}}\ \ \dot{\textbf{r}}_{12}=-\textbf{F}_{21}\) Thus, Coulomb's law agrees with the Newton's third law.
* Coulomb's law [Eq. (3)] gives the force between two charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in matter in the next chapter.

Figure 1.6: (a) Geometry and (b) Forces between charges.

**Example 1.4** Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between two point charges and Newton's law for gravitational force between two stationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on the distance between the charges/masses. (a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of their magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two protons. (b) Estimate the accelerations of electron and proton due to the electrical force of their mutual attraction when they are 1 A (= 10\({}^{10}\) m) apart? (\(m_{p}\) = 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) kg, \(m_{e}\) = 9.11 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-31}\) kg)

**Solution**

(a) The electric force between an electron and a proton at a distance \(r\) apart is:

\[F_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}}\]

where the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive. The corresponding gravitational force (always attractive) is:

\[F_{0}=-G\frac{m_{p}}{r^{2}}\]

where \(m_{p}\) and \(m_{e}\) are the masses of a proton and an electron respectively.

\[\left|\frac{F_{e}}{F_{0}}\right|=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} Gm_{p}m_{e}}=2.4\times 10^{39}\]

(ii) On similar lines, the ratio of the magnitudes of electric force to the gravitational force between two protons at a distance \(r\) apart is:

\[\left|\frac{F_{e}}{F_{0}}\right|=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} Gm_{p}m_{p}}=1.3\times 10^{36}\]

However, it may be mentioned here that the signs of the two forces are different. For two protons, the gravitational force is attractive in nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual values of these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distance between two protons is \(\sim\) 10\({}^{-15}\) m inside a nucleus) are \(F_{e}\) \(\sim\) 230 N whereas \(F_{0}\)\(\sim\) 1.9 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-34}\) N.

The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.

(b) The electric force **F** exerted by a proton on an electron is same in magnitude to the force exerted by an electron on a proton; however the masses of an electron and a proton are different. Thus, the magnitude of force is

\[\left|\textbf{F}\right| = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}}=8.987\times 10^{ 9}\text{ Nm}^{2}/\text{C}^{2}\times\text{(1.6 $\times$10${}^{-19}$C)}^{2}\text{ / (10${}^{-10}$m)}^{2}\] \[= 2.3\times 10^{-8}\text{N}\]

Using Newton's second law of motion, \(F\) = _ma_, the acceleration that an electron will undergo is

\(a\) = 2.3\(\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) N / 9.11 \(\times\)10\({}^{-31}\) kg = 2.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{32}\) m/s\({}^{2}\)

Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we can conclude that the effect of gravitational field is negligible on the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations under the action of Coulomb force due to a proton.

The value for acceleration of the proton is

\(2.3\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) N / 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) kg = 1.4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{19}\) m/s\({}^{2}\)

**Example 1.5** A charged metallic sphere A is suspended by a nylon thread. Another charged metallic sphere B held by an insulating handle is brought close to A such that the distance between their centres is 10 cm, as shown in Fig. 1.7(a). The resulting repulsion of A is noted (for example, by shining a beam of light and measuring the deflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched by uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.7(b). C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a distance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. 1.7(c). What is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb's law? Spheres A and C and spheres B and D have identical sizes. Ignore the sizes of A and B in comparison to the separation between their centres.

**Figure 1.7**

**Solution** Let the original charge on sphere A be \(q\) and that on B be \(q^{\prime}\). At a distance \(r\) between their centres, the magnitude of the electrostatic force on each is given by

\[F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{qq^{\prime}}{r^{2}}\]

neglecting the sizes of spheres A and B in comparison to \(r\). When an identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge \(q/2\). Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is \(q/2\). Now, if the separation between A and B is halved, the magnitude of the electrostatic force on each is

\[F^{\prime}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{(q/2)[q^{\prime}/2]}{(r/2)^{2}}= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{(qq^{\prime})}{r^{2}}=F\]

Thus the electrostatic force on A, due to B, remains unaltered.

### Forces between Multiple Charges

The mutual electric force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law. How to calculate the force on a charge where there are not one but several charges around? Consider a system of \(n\) stationary charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\),..., \(q_{n}\) in vacuum. What is the force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\),..., \(q_{n}\)? Coulomb's law is not enough to answer this question. Recall that forces of mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?

Experimentally it is verified that _force on any charge due to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces on that charge due to the other charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of other charges._ This is termed as the _principle of superposition_.

To better understand the concept, consider a system of three charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\) and \(q_{3}\), as shown in Fig. 8(a). The force on one charge, say \(q_{1}\), due to two other charges \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\) can therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the forces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{2}\) is denoted by \(\textbf{F}_{12}\), \(\textbf{F}_{12}\) is given by Eq. (1.3) even though other charges are present.

Thus, \(\textbf{F}_{12}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}}\textbf {F}_{12}\)

In the same way, the force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{3}\), denoted by \(\textbf{F}_{13}\), is given by

\[\textbf{F}_{13}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}^{2}}\textbf {F}_{13}\]

Figure 1.8: A system of (a) three charges (b) multiple charges.

which again is the Coulomb force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{3}\), even though other charge \(q_{2}\) is present.

Thus the total force \(\textbf{F}_{1}\) on \(q_{1}\) due to the two charges \(q_{2}\) and \(q_{3}\) is given as

\[\textbf{F}_{1}=\textbf{F}_{12}+\textbf{F}_{13}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{ q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}}\textbf{i}_{12}+\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{ 3}}{r_{13}^{2}}\textbf{i}_{13} \tag{1.4}\]

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of charges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.8(b).

The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\),..., \(q_{n}\), the force on \(q_{1}\) due to \(q_{2}\) is the same as given by Coulomb's law, i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges \(q_{3}\), \(q_{4}\),..., \(q_{n}\). The total force \(\textbf{F}_{1}\) on the charge \(q_{1}\), due to all other charges, is then given by the vector sum of the forces \(\textbf{F}_{12}\), \(\textbf{F}_{13}\),..., \(\textbf{F}_{1n}\):

\[\textbf{F}_{1}=\textbf{F}_{12}+\textbf{F}_{13}+...+\textbf{F}_{1n}=\frac{1}{ 4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\bigg{[}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}}\textbf{i}_{12}+\frac{ q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}^{2}}\textbf{i}_{13}+...+\frac{q_{1}q_{n}}{r_{1n}^{2}}\textbf{i}_{n} \bigg{]}\]

\[.\]

\[=\frac{q_{1}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\sum_{i=2}^{n}\frac{q_{i}}{r_{1n}^{2}}\textbf{i }_{1i} \tag{1.5}\]

The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of addition of vectors. All of electrostatics is basically a consequence of Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.

**Example 1.6** Consider three charges \(q_{i}\), \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\) each equal to \(q\) at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side \(l\). What is the force on a charge \(\mathcal{G}\) (with the same sign as \(q\)) placed at the centroid of the triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.9?

**Solution** In the given equilateral triangle ABC of sides of length \(l\), if we draw a perpendicular AD to the side BC, \(\text{AD}=\text{AC}\ \text{cos}\ 30^{\circ}=(\sqrt{3}/2)\ l\) and the distance AO of the centroid O from A is \((2/3)\text{AD}=(1/\sqrt{3})\ l\) By symmetry AO = BO = CO.

**Figure 1.10**

**Solution** The forces acting on charge \(q\) at A due to charges \(q\) at B and \(-q\) at C are \(\textbf{F}_{12}\) along BA and \(\textbf{F}_{13}\) along AC respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.10. By the parallelogram law, the total force \(\textbf{F}_{1}\) on the charge \(q\) at A is given by \(\textbf{F}_{1}=F\ \hat{\textbf{r}}_{1}\) where \(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{1}\) is a unit vector along BC.

The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the same magnitude \(F=\frac{q^{2}}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}\,l^{2}}\)

The total force \(\textbf{F}_{2}\) on charge \(q\) at B is thus \(\textbf{F}_{2}=F\ \hat{\textbf{r}}_{2}\), where \(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{2}\) is a unit vector along AC.

Similarly the total force on charge \(-q\) at C is \(\mathbf{F}_{3}=\sqrt{3}\;\;F\;\bar{\mathbf{n}}\), where \(\bar{\mathbf{n}}\) is the unit vector along the direction bisecting the \(\angle\)BCA.

It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges is zero, i.e.,

\(\mathbf{F}_{1}+\mathbf{F}_{2}+\mathbf{F}_{3}=0\)

The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact that Coulomb's law is consistent with Newton's third law. The proof is left to you as an exercise.

### 8 Electric Field

Let us consider a point charge \(Q\) placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we place another point charge \(q\) at a point P, where \(\mathbf{OP}=\mathbf{r}\), then the charge \(Q\) will exert a force on \(q\) as per Coulomb's law. We may ask the question: If charge \(q\) is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there nothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act when we place the charge \(q\) at P. In order to answer such questions, the early scientists introduced the concept of _field_. According to this, we say that the charge \(Q\) produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding. When another charge \(q\) is brought at some point P, the field there acts on it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge \(Q\) at a point \(\mathbf{r}\) is given as

\[\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{ \hat{r}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}} \tag{6}\]

where \(\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\mathbf{r}/\mathbf{r}\), is a unit vector from the origin to the point \(\mathbf{r}\). Thus, Eq.(6) specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position vector \(\mathbf{r}\). The word "field" signifies how some distributed quantity (which could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the force \(\mathbf{F}\) exerted by a charge \(Q\) on a charge \(q\), as

\[\mathbf{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Qq}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}} \tag{7}\]

Note that the charge \(q\) also exerts an equal and opposite force on the charge \(Q\). The electrostatic force between the charges \(Q\) and \(q\) can be looked upon as an interaction between charge \(q\) and the electric field of \(Q\) and _vice versa_. If we denote the position of charge \(q\) by the vector \(\mathbf{r}\), it experiences a force \(\mathbf{F}\) equal to the charge \(q\) multiplied by the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) at the location of \(q\). Thus,

\[\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})=q\,\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) \tag{8}\]

Equation (8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.

Some important remarks may be made here:

From Eq. (8), we can infer that if \(q\) is unity, the electric field due to a charge \(Q\) is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the _electric field due to a charge \(Q\) at a point in space may be defined as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placedat that point._ The charge \(\mathcal{G}\), which is producing the electric field, is called a _source charge_ and the charge \(q\), which tests the effect of a source charge, is called a _test charge_. Note that the source charge \(\mathcal{G}\) must remain at its original location. However, if a charge \(q\) is brought at any point around \(\mathcal{G}\), \(\mathcal{G}\) itself is bound to experience an electrical force due to \(q\) and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to make \(q\) negligibly small. The force \(\mathbf{F}\) is then negligibly small but the ratio \(\mathbf{F}/q\) is finite and defines the electric field:

\[\mathbf{E}=\lim_{q\to 0}\left(\frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}\right) \tag{9}\]

A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping \(\mathcal{G}\) undisturbed in the presence of \(q\)) is to hold \(\mathcal{G}\) to its location by unspecified forces! This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice. When we are considering the electric force on a test charge \(q\) due to a charged planar sheet (Section 1.15), the charges on the sheet are held to their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents inside the sheet.

1. Note that the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) due to \(\mathcal{G}\), though defined operationally in terms of some test charge \(q\), is independent of \(q\). This is because \(\mathbf{F}\) is proportional to \(q\), so the ratio \(\mathbf{F}/q\) does not depend on \(q\). The force \(\mathbf{F}\) on the charge \(q\) due to the charge \(\mathcal{G}\) depends on the particular location of charge \(q\) which may take any value in the space around the charge \(\mathcal{G}\). Thus, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) due to \(\mathcal{G}\) is also dependent on the space coordinate \(\mathbf{r}\). For different positions of the charge \(q\) all over the space, we get different values of electric field \(\mathbf{E}\). The field exists at every point in three-dimensional space.
2. For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is negative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.
3. Since the magnitude of the force \(\mathbf{F}\) on charge \(q\) due to charge \(\mathcal{G}\) depends only on the distance \(r\) of the charge \(q\) from charge \(\mathcal{G}\), the magnitude of the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) will also depend only on the distance \(r\). Thus at equal distances from the charge \(\mathcal{G}\), the magnitude of its electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is same. The magnitude of electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) due to a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.

#### 1.8.1 Electric field due to a system of charges

Consider a system of charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\),..., \(q_{n}\) with position vectors \(\mathbf{r}_{1}\), \(\mathbf{r}_{2}\),..., \(\mathbf{r}_{n}\) relative to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original positions of charges \(q_{i}\), \(q_{2}\),..., \(q_{n}\). We can use Coulomb's law and the superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by position vector \(\mathbf{r}\).

\(\mathbf{E}\) is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space and is determined from the positions of the source charges.

#### Physical significance of electric field

You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb's law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this intermediate quantity called the electric field?

For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine the field. The term _field_ in physics generally refers to a quantity that is defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.

The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however, emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force between two distant charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\) in accelerated motion. Now the greatest speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another is \(c\), the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of \(q_{1}\) on \(q_{2}\) cannot arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect (force on \(q_{2}\)) and the cause (motion of \(q_{1}\)). It is precisely here that the notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very useful. _The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge \(q_{1}\) produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed \(c\), reach \(q_{2}\) and cause a force on \(q_{2}\)_. The notion of field elegantly accounts for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an _independent dynamics_ of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws of their _own_. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on briefly and switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday and is now among the central concepts in physics.

**Example 1.8** An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a uniform electric field of magnitude \(2.0\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) [Fig. 13(a)]. The direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 13(b)]. Compute the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of 'free fall under gravity'.

**Solution** In Fig. 13(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged electron experiences a downward force of magnitude \(eE\) where \(E\) is the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is \(a_{e}=eE/m_{e}\) where \(m_{e}\) is the mass of the electron.

Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a distance \(h\) is given by \(\cdot\).

For \(e=1.6\times 10^{-10}\)C, \(m_{e}=9.11\times 10^{-31}\) kg.

\(E=2.0\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{-1}\), \(h=1.5\times 10^{2}\) m,

\(t_{\rm{e}}=2.9\times 10^{-9}\)s

In Fig. 13 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged proton experiences a downward force of magnitude \(eE\). The acceleration of the proton is

\(a_{p}=eE/m_{p}\)

where \(m_{p}\) is the mass of the proton; \(m_{p}=1.67\times 10^{-27}\) kg. The time of fall for the proton is 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:429]

The electric field vector \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{in}}\) at B due to the positive charge \(q_{\text{i}}\) points towards the left and has a magnitude \(E_{\text{in}}=\frac{\{9\times 10^{9}\text{N}\text{m}^{2}\text{C}^{-2}\}\times(10^{ -6}\text{C})}{(0.05\,\text{m}^{2})}=3.6\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) The electric field vector \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{in}}\) at B due to the negative charge \(q_{\text{z}}\) points towards the right and has a magnitude \(E_{\text{in}}=\frac{\{9\times 10^{9}\text{N}\text{m}^{2}\text{C}^{-2}\}\times(10^{ -8}\text{C})}{(0.15\,\text{m}^{2})}=\ 4\times 10^{3}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) The magnitude of the total electric field at B is \(E_{\text{0}}=E_{\text{in}}-E_{\text{in}}=3.2\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) \(E_{\text{in}}\) is directed towards the left. The magnitude of each electric field vector at point C, due to charge \(q_{\text{i}}\) and \(q_{\text{z}}\) is \(E_{\text{tc}}=E_{\text{2c}}=\frac{(9\times 10^{9}\text{N}\text{m}^{2}\text{C}^{ -2})\times(10^{-8}\text{C})}{(0.10\,\text{m})^{2}}=\ 9\times 10^{3}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) The directions in which these two vectors point are indicated in Fig. 1.14. The resultant of these two vectors is \(E_{\text{c}}=E_{\text{i}}\cos\,\frac{\pi}{3}+E_{\text{z}}\cos\,\frac{\pi}{3}= \ 9\times 10^{3}\) N C\({}^{-1}\) \(E_{\text{c}}\) points towards the right.

### 1.9 Electric Field Lines

We have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent \(\mathbf{E}\) due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength of the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing radially outward. Figure 1.15 shows such a picture. In this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of that arrow. Connect the arrows pointing in one direction and the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge. Have we lost the information about the strength or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the field is represented by the density of field lines. \(\mathbf{E}\) is strong near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near the charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge, the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less, resulting in well-separated lines.

Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not important. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.

Figure 1.15: Field of a point charge.

It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is important.

We draw the figure on the plane of paper, _i.e._, in two-dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the lines. Since the electric field decreases as the square of the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the charge increases as the square of the distance, the number of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant, whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.

We started by saying that the field lines carry information about the direction of electric field at different points in space. Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density (i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart where it is weak. Figure 16 shows a set of field lines. We can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.

To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather the _solid angle_ subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the area with the solid angle, a generalization of angle to three dimensions. Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small transverse line element \(\Delta l\) be placed at a distance \(r\) from a point O. Then the angle subtended by \(\Delta l\) at O can be approximated as \(\Delta\theta=\Delta l/r\). Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle1 subtended by a small perpendicular plane area \(\Delta S\), at a distance \(r\), can be written as \(\Delta\Omega=\Delta S/r^{2}\). We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial field lines is the same. In Fig. 16, for two points P\({}_{1}\) and P\({}_{2}\) at distances \(r_{i}\) and \(r_{2}\) from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle \(\Delta\Omega\) is \(r_{1}^{2}\,\Delta\Omega\) at P\({}_{1}\) and an element of area \(r_{2}^{2}\,\Delta\Omega\) at P\({}_{2}\), respectively. The number of lines (say \(n\)) cutting these area elements are the same. The number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore \(n/(r_{1}^{2}\,\Delta\Omega)\) at P\({}_{1}\) and\(n/(r_{2}^{2}\,\Delta\Omega)\) at P\({}_{2}\), respectively. Since \(n\) and \(\Delta\Omega\) are common, the strength of the field clearly has a \(1/r^{2}\) dependence.

Footnote 1: Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone with a sphere of radius \(R\). The solid angle \(\Delta\Omega\) of the cone is defined to be equal to \(\Delta S/R^{2}\), where \(\Delta S\) is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.

The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an intuitive non- mathematical way of visualizing electric fields around charged configurations. Faraday called them _lines of force. This term is somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more appropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have adopted in this book._

Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorally mapping the electric field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,

Figure 16: Dependence of electric field strength on the distance and its relation to the number of field lines.

a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each point is in the direction of the net field at that point. An arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the direction of electric field from the two possible directions indicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.

Figure 17 shows the field lines around some simple charge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them only in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge are radially outward while those of a single negative charge are radially inward. The field lines around a system of two positive charges (\(q\), \(q\)) give a vivid pictorial description of their mutual repulsion, while those around the configuration of two equal and opposite charges (\(q\), \(-q\)), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction between the charges. The field lines follow some important general properties:

1. Field lines start from positive charges and end at negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may start or end at infinity.
2. In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken to be continuous curves without any breaks.
3. Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did, the field at the point of intersection will not have a unique direction, which is absurd.)
4. Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops. This follows from the conservative nature of electric field (Chapter 2).

### 1.10 Electric Flux

Consider flow of a liquid with velocity \(\mathbf{v}\), through a small flat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the area per unit time \(\upsilon\,\mathrm{dS}\) and represents the flux of liquid flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is not parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, _i.e._, to \(\mathbf{v}\), but makes an angle \(\theta\) with it, the projected area in a plane perpendicular to \(\mathbf{v}\) is \(\upsilon\,\mathrm{dS}\cos\,\theta\). Therefore the flux going out of the surface dS is \(\mathbf{v}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) dS.

For the case of the electric field, we define an analogous quantity and call it _electric flux_.

We should however note that there is no _flow_ of a physically observable quantity unlike the case of liquid flow.

In the picture of electric field lines described above, we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area, placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the strength of electric field at that point. This means that if

Figure 17: Field lines due to some simple charge configurations.

we place a small planar element of area \(\Delta\)S normal to **E** at a point, the number of field lines crossing it is proportional* to \(E\)\(\Delta\)S. Now suppose we tilt the area element by angle \(\theta\). Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the area element will be smaller. The projection of the area element normal to \(E\) is \(\Delta\)S\(\cos\theta\). Thus, the number of field lines crossing \(\Delta\)S is proportional to \(E\)\(\Delta\)S\(\cos\theta\). When \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), field lines will be parallel to \(\Delta\)S and will not cross it at all (Fig. 1.18).

Footnote *: It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to EAS. The number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing a given area at different points.

The orientation of area element and not merely its magnitude is important in many contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount of water flowing through a ring will naturally depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow through it than if you hold it with some other orientation. This shows that an area element should be treated as a vector. It has a magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.

How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements. Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated with it, as explained before.

Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element? This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple. The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken to be in the direction of the _outward_ normal. This is the convention used in Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector \(\Delta\)**S** at a point on a closed surface equals \(\Delta\)S \(\hat{\textbf{n}}\) where \(\Delta\)S is the magnitude of the area element and \(\hat{\textbf{n}}\) is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.

We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux \(\Delta\)\(\phi\) through an area element \(\Delta\)**S** is defined by

\[\Delta\phi=\textbf{E}\cdot\Delta\textbf{S}=E\,\Delta\,\,\text{cos}\theta \tag{1.11}\]

which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting the area element. The angle \(\theta\) here is the angle between **E** and \(\Delta\)**S**. For a closed surface, with the convention stated already, \(\theta\) is the angle between **E** and the outward normal to the area element. Notice we could look at the expression \(E\)\(\Delta\)S \(\cos\theta\) in two ways: E (\(\Delta\)S \(\cos\theta\)) i.e., \(E\) times the projection of area normal to \(\mathbf{E}\), or \(E_{\perp}\Delta S\), i.e., component of \(\mathbf{E}\) along the normal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The unit of electric flux is N \(C^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{2}\).

The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (11) can be used, in principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux \(\phi\) through a surface \(S\) is

\[\phi\simeq\Sigma\,\mathbf{E}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{S} \tag{12}\]

The approximation sign is put because the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is taken to be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact only when you take the limit \(\Delta S\to 0\) and the sum in Eq. (12) is written as an integral.

### Electric Dipole

An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges \(q\) and \(-q\). separated by a distance \(2a\). The line connecting the two charges defines a direction in space. By convention, the direction from \(-q\) to \(q\) is said to be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of \(-q\) and \(q\) is called the centre of the dipole.

The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge \(q\) and \(-q\) are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when added, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than the separation of the two charges forming a dipole (\(r>>2a\)), the fields due to \(q\) and \(-q\) nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like \(1/r^{2}\) (the dependence on \(r\) of the field due to a single charge \(q\)). These qualitative ideas are borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:

#### The field of an electric dipole

The electric field of the pair of charges (\(-q\) and \(q\)) at any point in space can be found out from Coulomb's law and the superposition principle. The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the _equatorial plane_ of the dipole, i.e., on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre. The electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric fields \(\mathbf{E}_{-q}\) due to the charge \(-q\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{+q}\) due to the charge \(q\), by the parallelogram law of vectors.

#### (i) For points on the axis

Let the point P be at distance \(r\) from the centre of the dipole on the side of the charge \(q\). as shown in Fig. 20(a). Then

\[\mathbf{E}_{-q}=-\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}(r+a)^{2}}\,\mathbf{\hat{P}} \tag{13}\]

where \(\mathbf{\hat{P}}\) is the unit vector along the dipole axis (from \(-q\) to \(\phi\)). Also

\[\mathbf{E}_{+q}=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}(r-a)^{2}}\,\mathbf{\hat{P}} \tag{13}\]\[\mathbf{E}=-\frac{2\,q\,a}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{o}\,r^{3}}\,\hat{\mathbf{p}}\qquad \qquad(r>>a) \tag{1.18}\]

At large distances (\(r>>a\)), this reduces to

\[\mathbf{E}=-\frac{2\,q\,a}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{o}\,r^{3}}\,\hat{\mathbf{p}} \qquad\qquad(r>>a) \tag{1.19}\]

From Eqs. (1.16) and (1.19), it is clear that the dipole field at large distances does not involve \(q\) and \(a\) separately; it depends on the product \(qa\). This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The _dipole moment vector_\(\mathbf{p}\) of an electric dipole is defined by

\[\mathbf{p}=q\times 2\,a\,\,\hat{\mathbf{p}} \tag{1.20}\]

that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge \(q\) times the separation \(2a\) (between the pair of charges \(q\), \(-q\)) and the direction is along the line from \(-q\) to \(q\). In terms of \(\mathbf{p}\), the electric field of a dipole at large distances takes simple forms:

_At a point on the dipole axis_

\[\mathbf{E}=\frac{2\,\mathbf{p}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r^{3}}\qquad\qquad(r>>a) \tag{1.21}\]

_At a point on the equatorial plane_

\[\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\mathbf{p}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r^{3}}\qquad\qquad(r>>a) \tag{1.22}\]Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances falls off not as \(1/r^{2}\) but as\(1/r^{3}\). Further, the magnitude and the direction of the dipole field depends not only on the distance \(r\) but also on the _angle_ between the position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) and the dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}\).

We can think of the limit when the dipole size \(2a\) approaches zero, the charge \(q\) approaches infinity in such a way that the product \(p=q\times 2a\) is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a _point dipole_. For a point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any \(r\).

#### Physical significance of dipoles

In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges* lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO\({}_{2}\) and CH\({}_{4}\) are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H\({}_{2}\)O, is an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting properties and important applications in the presence or absence of electric field.

**Example 1.10**: Two charges \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\)C are placed 5.0 mm apart. Determine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole 15 cm away from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as shown in Fig. 1.21(a), and (b) a point Q. 15 cm away from O on a line passing through O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in Fig. 1.21(b).

### Dipole in a Uniform External Field

Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment **p** in a uniform external field **E**, as shown in Fig. 22. (By permanent dipole, we mean that **p** exists irrespective of **E**; it has not been induced by **E**.)

There is a force \(q\)**E** on \(q\) and a force -\(q\)**E** on -\(q\). The net force on the dipole is zero, since **E** is uniform. However, the charges are separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (coupled) is independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular distance between the two antiparallel forces).

Magnitude of torque = \(q\,E\times 2\)\(a\) sin\(\theta\)

= \(2\)\(q\,a\,E\) sin\(\theta\)

Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.

The magnitude of **p**\(\times\)**E** is also \(p\,E\) sin\(\theta\) and its direction is normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,

\[\tau=\textbf{p}\times\textbf{E} \tag{22}\]

This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field **E**. When **p** is aligned with **E**, the torque is zero.

What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case, the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler situations when **p** is parallel to **E** or antiparallel to **E**. In either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force on the dipole if **E** is not uniform.

Figure 23 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that when **p** is parallel to **E**, the dipole has a net force in the direction of increasing field. When **p** is antiparallel to **E**, the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of **p** with respect to **E**.

This brings us to a common observation in frictional electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of paper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through friction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains the attractive force? Taking the clue from the precedingdiscussion, the charged comb 'polarizes' the piece of paper, i.e., induces a net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field due to the comb is not uniform. In this situation, it is easily seen that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!

### 1.13 Continuous Charge Distribution

We have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\),..., \(q_{n}\). One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element \(\Delta\)S (Fig. 24) on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and specify the charge \(\Delta\)_Q_ on that element. We then define a _surface charge density_\(\sigma\) at the area element by

\[\sigma=\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\Delta\sigma} \tag{23}\]

We can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at a continuous function \(\sigma\), called the surface charge density. The surface charge density \(\sigma\) so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. \(\sigma\) represents macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out average of the microscopic charge density over an area element \(\Delta\)S which, as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The units for \(\sigma\) are C/m\({}^{2}\).

Footnote *: At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.

Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume charge distribution. The _linear charge density_\(\lambda\) of a wire is defined by

\[\lambda=\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\Delta\sigma} \tag{24}\]

where \(\Delta\)I is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that, however, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents, and \(\Delta\)_Q_ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for \(\lambda\) are C/m. The _volume charge density_ (sometimes simply called charge density) is defined in a similar manner:

\[\rho=\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\Delta\sigma} \tag{25}\]

where \(\Delta\)_Q_ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume element \(\Delta\)V that includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents. The units for \(\rho\) are C/m\({}^{3}\).

The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:440]

\(\phi=\sum\limits_{\text{all}\,\text{ss}}\ \ \frac{q}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}\ r^{2}}\, \Delta S\)

Since each area element of the sphere is at the same distance \(r\) from the charge,

\(\phi=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\ r^{2}\ \varepsilon^{\text{all}\,\text{ss}} \Delta S}=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\ r^{2}}S\)

Now S, the total area of the sphere, equals \(4\pi r^{2}\). Thus,

\(\phi=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\ r^{2}}\times 4\pi r^{2}=\frac{q}{ \varepsilon_{0}}\) (1.30)

Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of electrostatics called Gauss's law.

We state _Gauss's law_ without proof:

_Electric flux through a closed surface S_

\(=q/\varepsilon_{0}\)

\(q=total\) _charge enclosed by S_.

The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in the simple situation of Fig. 1.26.

Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total flux \(\phi\) through the surface is \(\phi=\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}+\phi_{3}\), where \(\phi_{1}\) and \(\phi_{2}\) represent the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (or circular cross-section) of the cylinder and \(\phi_{3}\) is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is perpendicular to **E**, so by definition of flux, \(\phi_{3}=0\). Further, the outward normal to 2 is along **E** while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to **E**. Therefore,

\(\phi_{1}=-E\,S_{1},\ \ \ \ \phi_{2}=+E\,S_{2}\)

\(S_{1}=S_{2}=S\)

where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero, as expected by Gauss's law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge contained in the closed surface is zero.

The great significance of Gauss's law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let us note some important points regarding this law:

1. Gauss's law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or size.
2. The term \(q\) on the right side of Gauss's law, Eq. (1.31), includes the sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located anywhere inside the surface.
3. In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and outside S. The term \(q\) on the right side of Gauss's law, however, represents only the total charge inside S.

* The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss's law is called the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and apply Gauss's law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a continuous charge distribution.
* Gauss's law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the electrostatic field _when the system has some symmetry._ This is facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.
* Finally, Gauss's law is based on the inverse square dependence on distance contained in the Coulomb's law. Any violation of Gauss's law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

**Example 1.11**: The electric field components in Fig. 1.27 are \(E_{x}=\alpha x^{1/2}\), \(E_{y}=E_{z}=0\), in which \(\alpha=800\) N/C m\({}^{1/2}\). Calculate (a) the flux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube. Assume that \(a=0.1\) m.

**Solution**

* Since the electric field has only an \(x\) component, for faces perpendicular to \(x\) direction, the angle between \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\) is \(\pm\pi/2\). Therefore, the flux \(\phi=\mathbf{E}\).\(\Delta\mathbf{S}\) is separately zero for each face of the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of the electric field at the left face is \(E_{x}=\alpha x^{1/2}=\alpha a^{1/2}\).
* The magnitude of electric field at the right face is \(E_{R}=\alpha\ x^{1/2}=\alpha\ (2\alpha)^{1/2}\) (\(x=2\alpha\) at the right face). The corresponding fluxes are \(\phi_{t}=\mathbf{E}_{t}\wedge\mathbf{S}=\Delta\mathbf{E}_{t}\cdot\mathbf{ \dot{n}}_{t}=E_{t}\,\Delta\mathbf{S}\) cos\(\theta=-E_{t}\,\Delta\mathbf{S}\), since \(\theta=180^{\circ}\) \(=-E_{t}\alpha^{2}\) \(\phi_{t}=\mathbf{E}_{t}\wedge\Delta\mathbf{S}=E_{R}\,\Delta\mathbf{S}\) cos\(\theta=E_{R}\,\Delta\mathbf{S}\), since \(\theta=0^{\circ}\) \(=E_{R}\alpha^{2}\) \(\mathbf{S}\).
* Net flux through the cube

### 1.15 Applications of Gauss's Law

The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above, given by Eq. (27). In practice, except for some special cases, the summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried out to give electric field at every point in space. For some symmetric charge configurations, however, it is possible to obtain the electric field in a simple way using the Gauss's law. This is best understood by some examples.

#### 1.15.1 Field due to an infinitely long straight uniformly charged wire

Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire with uniform linear charge density \(\lambda\). The wire is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it around the wire. The points P, P', P'' so obtained are completely equivalent with respect to the charged wire. This implies that the electric field must have the same magnitude at these points. The direction of electric field at every point must be radial (outward if \(\lambda>0\), inward if \(\lambda<0\)). This is clear from Fig. 29.

Consider a pair of line elements P\({}_{1}\) and P\({}_{2}\) of the wire, as shown. The electric fields produced by the two elements of the pair when summed give a resultant electric field which is radial (the components normal to the radial vector cancel). This is true for any such pair and hence the total field at any point P is radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite, electric field does not depend on the position of P along the length of the wire. In short, the electric field is everywhere radial in the plane cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude depends only on the radial distance \(r\).

To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 29(b). Since the field is everywhere radial, flux through the two ends of the cylindrical Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical part of the surface, **E** is normal to the surface at every point, and its magnitude is constant, since it depends only on \(r\). The surface area of the curved part is \(2\pi rl\), where \(l\) is the length of the cylinder.

Figure 29: **(a)** Electric field due to an infinitely long thin straight wire is radial. (b) The Gaussian surface for a long thin wire of uniform linear charge density.

Physics

Flux through the Gaussian surface

= flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface

= \(E\times 2\pi rl\)

The surface includes charge equal to \(\lambda\,l\). Gauss's law then gives

\(E\times 2\pi rl=\lambda l/e_{0}\)

i.e., \(E=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}r}\)

Vectorially, \(\mathbf{E}\) at any point is given by

\(\mathbf{E}=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}r}\)\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\)

where \(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing through the point. \(\mathbf{E}\) is directed outward if \(\lambda\) is positive and inward if \(\lambda\) is negative.

Note that when we write a vector \(\mathbf{A}\) as a scalar multiplied by a unit vector, i.e., as \(\mathbf{A}=A\)\(\hat{\mathbf{a}}\), the scalar \(A\) is an algebraic number. It can be negative or positive. The direction of \(\mathbf{A}\) will be the same as that of the unit vector \(\hat{\mathbf{a}}\) if \(A>0\) and opposite to \(\hat{\mathbf{a}}\) if \(A<0\). When we want to restrict to non-negative values, we use the symbol \(|\mathbf{A}|\)and call it the modulus of \(\mathbf{A}\). Thus, \(|\mathbf{A}|\geq 0\).

Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface (\(\lambda l\)) was included above, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is due to the charge on the entire wire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial. Without this assumption, we cannot take \(\mathbf{E}\) to be normal to the curved part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (32) is approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long wire, where the end effects may be ignored.

#### Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet

Let \(\sigma\) be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet (Fig. 30). We take the \(x\)-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry, the electric field will not depend on \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates and its direction at every point must be parallel to the \(x\)-direction.

We can take the Gaussian surface to be a rectangular parallelepiped of cross sectional area \(A\), as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel to the other faces and they, therefore, do not contribute to the total flux.

The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in -\(x\) direction while the unit vector normal to surface 2 is in the +\(x\) direction. Therefore, flux \(\mathbf{E}\).\(\Delta\mathbf{S}\) through both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore the net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA. The charge enclosed by the closed surface is \(\sigma A\). Therefore by Gauss's law,

Figure 30: Gaussian surface for a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet.

\[2\;E\Delta=\sigma A/\varepsilon_{0}\] or, \[E=\sigma/2\varepsilon_{0}\] Vectorically, \[\mathbf{E}=\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}\,\hat{\mathbf{n}} \tag{33}\]

where \(\,\dot{\mathbf{n}}\,\) is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.

\(\mathbf{E}\,\) is directed away from the plate if \(\sigma\,\) is positive and toward the plate if \(\sigma\,\) is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss' law has brought out an additional fact: \(E\,\)is independent of \(x\,\)also.

For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (33) is approximately true in the middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.

#### 15.3 Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell

Let \(\sigma\,\)be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of radius \(R\) (Fig. 31). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on \(r\) (the radial distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e., along the radius vector).

**(i)**: _Field outside the shell:_ Consider a point P outside the shell with radius vector \(\mathbf{r}\). To calculate \(\mathbf{E}\,\)at P, we take the Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius \(r\) and with centre O, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude \(E\,\)and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, \(\mathbf{E}\,\)and \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\,\)at every point are parallel and the flux through each element is \(E\,\Delta\mathbf{S}\). Summing over all \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\), the flux through the Gaussian surface is \(E\,\times\,4\,\,\pi\,r^{2}\). The charge enclosed is \(\sigma\,\times\,4\,\,\pi\,R^{2}\). By Gauss's law

\[E\,\times\,4\,\pi\,r^{2}=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}\,4\,\, \pi\,R^{2}\] \[\cdot\] Or, \[E=\frac{\sigma\,R^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\,r^{2}=\frac{q}{4\,\pi \varepsilon_{0}\,r^{2}}\]

where \(q=4\,\,\pi R^{2}\,\sigma\,\)is the total charge on the spherical shell. Vectorially,

\[\mathbf{E}=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\,r^{2}}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}} \tag{34}\]

The electric field is directed outward if \(q>0\) and inward if \(q<0\). This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge \(q\) placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due to a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is concentrated at its centre.
**(ii)**: _Field inside the shell:_ In Fig. 31, the point P is inside the shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.

The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is \(E\times 4\,\pi\,r^{2}\). However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no charge. Gauss's law then gives \(E\times 4\,\pi\,r^{2}=0\) i.e., \(E=0\) (\(r<R\)) that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points inside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss's law which follows from Coulomb's law. The experimental verification of this result confirms the \(1/r^{2}\) dependence in Coulomb's law.

Footnote *: Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 8.5 of Class XI Textbook of Physics.

**Example 1.13**: An early model for an atom considered it to have a positively charged point nucleus of charge \(Ze\), surrounded by a uniform density of negative charge up to a radius \(R\). The atom as a whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance \(r\) from the nucleus?

**Solution** The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as shown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical charge distribution of radius \(R\) must be \(-Z\,e\), since the atom (nucleus of charge \(Z\,e\) + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us the negative charge density \(p\), since we must have \(\frac{4\,\pi R^{3}}{3}\)\(\rho=0\)\(-Ze\). or \(\rho=-\frac{3\,Ze}{4\,\pi R^{3}}\) To find the electric field **E(r)** at a point P which is a distance \(r\) away from the nucleus, we use Gauss's law. Because of the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric field **E(r)** depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the direction of **r**. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector **r** from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations, namely, \(r<R\) and \(r>R\). (i) \(r<R\) : The electric flux \(\phi\) enclosed by the spherical surface is \(\phi\ =\ E\left(r\right)\times 4\,\pi\,r^{2}\) where \(E\left(r\right)\) is the magnitude of the electric field at \(r\). This is because the field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the same direction as the normal to the surface there, and has the same magnitude at all points on the surface.

The charge \(q\) enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear charge and the negative charge within the sphere of radius \(r\), i.e., \(q=Ze\ +\ \frac{4\ \pi r^{3}}{3}\rho\)

Substituting for the charge density \(\rho\) obtained earlier, we have \(q=Ze-Ze\frac{r^{3}}{R^{3}}\)

Gauss's law then gives, \(E(r)=\frac{Z\ e}{4\ \pi\ e_{0}}\ \left(\frac{1}{r^{2}}-\frac{r}{R^{3}}\right)\); \(r<R\)

The electric field is directed radially outward.

(ii) \(r>R\): In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian spherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss's law, \(E(r)\times 4\ \pi\ \ r^{2}=0\ \ \text{or}\ \ E\left(r\right)=0\); \(r>R\)

At \(r=R\), both cases give the same result: \(E=0\).

## 3.3. Curvature observations

In Physics, we often encounter systems with various symmetries. Consideration of these symmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward calculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge density \(\sigma\)) along the \(y\)-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the \(y\)-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the \(x\)-axis through any angle. As the system is unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular, in this example, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) must be unchanged.

Translation symmetry along the \(y\)-axis shows that the electric field must be the same at a point (0, \(y_{1}\), 0) as at (0, \(y_{2}\), 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis shows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z\({}_{\text{r}}\)) and (0, 0, z\({}_{\text{z}}\)) must be the same. By using rotation symmetry around the \(x\)-axis, we can conclude that \(\mathbf{E}\) must be perpendicular to the \(y\)-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the \(x\)-direction.

Try to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric field is a constant, independent of the \(x\)-coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude of the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all points in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of the sheet.

Compare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation using Coulomb's law.

## Summary

1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms, molecules and bulk matter.
2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is then negative.
3. Conductors allow movement of electrte charge through them, insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.
4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity and conservation. Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (_q_) of a body is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (_e_) i.e., \(q=n\) e, where \(n=0\), \(\pm 1\), \(\pm 2\), \(\pm 3\),.... Proton and electron have charges \(+e\), \(-e\), respectively. For macroscopic charges for which \(n\) is a very large number, quantisation of charge can be ignored.

Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs) of all individual charges in the system.

Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.
5. _Coulomb's Law_: The mutual electrostatic force between two point charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) is proportional to the product \(q_{1}q_{2}\) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \(r_{21}\) separating them. Mathematically. \(\cdot\)\(\mathbf{F}_{21}=\) force on \(q_{2}\) due to \(q_{1}=\dfrac{\mathbf{k}}{r_{21}^{2}}\)\(\mathbf{\dot{z}}_{1}\) where \(\mathbf{\dot{z}}_{21}\) is a unit vector in the direction from \(q_{1}\) to \(q_{2}\) and \(\mathbf{k}=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\) is the constant of proportionality. In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of the constant \(\epsilon_{0}\) is \(\epsilon_{0}=8.854\times 10^{-12}\) C\({}^{2}\) N\({}^{1}\) m\({}^{-2}\) The approximate value of k is \(k=9\times 10^{9}\) N m\({}^{2}\) C\({}^{-2}\)
6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton and an electron is \(\dfrac{\mathbf{k}\ e^{2}}{G\ m_{e}m_{p}}\cong 2.4\ \times\ 10^{39}\)
7. _Superposition Principle_: The principle is based on the property that the forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For an assembly of charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\), \(q_{3}\),..., the force on any charge, say \(q_{i}\), isthe vector sum of the force on \(q_{i}\) due to \(q_{i}\), the force on \(q_{i}\) due to \(q_{i}\), and so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb's law for two charges stated earlier.
8. The electric field **E** at a point due to a charge configuration is the force on a small positive test charge \(q\) placed at the point divided by the magnitude of the charges. Electric field due to a point charge \(q\) has a magnitude \(|q|/4\pi_{o}r^{2}\); it is radially outwards from \(q\), if \(q\) is positive, and radially inwards if \(q\) is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field also satisfies superposition principle.
9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly spaced parallel straight lines.
10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are continuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross each other. (iii) Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges --they cannot form closed loops.
11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges \(q\) and \(-q\) separated by some distance \(2a\). Its dipole moment vector **p** has magnitude \(2qa\) and is in the direction of the dipole axis from \(-q\) to \(q\).
12. Field of an electric dipole in its equatorial plane (i.e., the plane perpendicular to its axis and passing through its centre) at a distance r from the centre:.. \(\textbf{E}=\frac{-\textbf{p}}{4\ \pi_{o}\ }\frac{1}{(\alpha^{2}+r^{2})^{ \textbf{q}/2}}\). \(\equiv\frac{-\textbf{p}}{4\ \pi_{o}\ r^{3}}\), \(\qquad\textbf{for}\ r>\alpha\) Dipole electric field on the axis at a distance \(r\) from the centre:. \(\textbf{E}=\frac{2\ \textbf{p}\ r}{4\ \pi_{o}(\textbf{r}^{2}-\alpha^{2})^{ \textbf{q}}}\). \(\equiv\frac{2\ \textbf{p}\ }{4\ \pi_{o}r^{3}}\)\(\qquad\textbf{for}\ \ r>\ \alpha\) The \(1/r^{3}\) dependence of dipole electric fields should be noted in contrast to the \(1/r^{2}\) dependence of electric field due to a point charge.

Points to Ponder

1. You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the strong force which holds them together. The range of distance where this force is effective is, however, very small \(\sim\)10\({}^{14}\) m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature.
2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square law. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive force in nature.
3. The constant of proportionality \(k\) in Coulomb's law is a matter of choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb's law. In SI units, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic effect (Amperse's law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of \(k\) is no longer arbitrary: it is approximately \(9\times 10^{5}\) N m\({}^{2}\) C\({}^{2}\).
4. The rather large value of \(k\), i.e., the large size of the unit of charge (1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of magnetic forces (forces on current-carrying wires) which are generally much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for electric effects.
5. The additive property of charge is not an 'obvious' property. It is related to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it; charge is a scalar.
6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always true for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative motion.
7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6. Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference. A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector quantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).
8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature; interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.
9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as 'obvious', or equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces which arise only when there are more than two charges.
10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined at the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume charge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution. For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous across the surface.

The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero is not zero: but for distances large compared to the size of the configuration, its field falls off faster than \(1/r^{2}\), typical of field due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of this fact.

## Chapter Two

### 2.1 Introduction

In Chapters 6 and 8 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was introduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a point to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force, that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing an equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and potential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called conservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of conservative forces.

Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges, like the gravitational force, is also a conservative force. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants - the masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb's law. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational field, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an electrostatic field.

Consider an electrostatic field **E** due to some charge configuration. First, for simplicity, consider the field **E** due to a charge \(\mathcal{G}\) placed at the origin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge \(q\) from a point R to a point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge \(\mathcal{G}\). With referenceto Fig. 2.1, this will happen if \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(q\) are both positive or both negative. For definiteness, let us take \(\mathcal{G}\), \(q>0\).

Two remarks may be made here. First, we assume that the test charge \(q\) is so small that it does not disturb the original configuration, namely the charge \(\mathcal{G}\) at the origin (or else, we keep \(\mathcal{G}\) fixed at the origin by some unspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge \(q\) from R to P, we apply an external force \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ex}}\) just enough to counter the repulsive electric force \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{E}}\) (i.e, \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}\) = -\(\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{p}}\)). This means there is no net force on or acceleration of the charge \(q\) when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential energy of the charge \(q\). If the external force is removed on reaching P, the electric force will take the charge away from \(\mathcal{G}\) - the stored energy (potential energy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge \(q\) in such a way that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.

Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge \(q\) from R to P is

\[\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{RP}} = \int\limits_{\mathrm{R}}^{\mathrm{P}}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}\text {-}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{r} \tag{2.1}\] \[= -\int\limits_{\mathrm{R}}^{\mathrm{P}}\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{E}}\text {-}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{r}\]

This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored as potential energy.

At every point in electric field, a particle with charge \(q\) possesses a certain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential energy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points R and P.

Thus, potential energy difference

\[\dot{\Delta U}=U_{p}-U_{R}=W_{RP} \tag{2.2}\]

(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., -\(W_{RP}\).)

Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between two points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving (without accelerating) charge \(q\) from one point to another for electric field of any arbitrary charge configuration.

Two important comments may be made at this stage:

1. The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions of the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in moving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial and the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from one point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a conservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be meaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the Coulomb's law. We omit this proof here.

Figure 2.1: A test charge \(q\) (\(>0\)) is moved from the point R to the point P against the repulsive force on it by the charge \(\mathcal{G}\) (\(>0\)) placed at the origin.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:460]

In other words, the electrostatic potential (\(V\)) at any point in a region with electrostatic field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge (without acceleration) from infinity to that point.

The qualifying remarks made earlier regarding potential energy also apply to the definition of potential. To obtain the work done per unit test charge, we should take an infinitesimal test charge \(\delta q\), obtain the work done \(\delta W\) in bringing it from infinity to the point and determine the ratio \(\delta W/\delta q\). Also, the external force at every point of the path is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic force on the test charge at that point.

### 2.3 Potential due to a Point Charge

Consider a point charge \(\mathcal{G}\) at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take \(\mathcal{G}\) to be positive. We wish to determine the potential at any point P with position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) from the origin. For that we must calculate the work done in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to the point P. For \(\mathcal{G}>0\), the work done against the repulsive force on the test charge is positive. Since work done is independent of the path, we choose a convenient path - along the radial direction from infinity to the point P.

At some intermediate point P\({}^{\prime}\) on the path, the electrostatic force on a unit positive charge is \(\frac{\mathcal{G}\times 1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{\alpha}}\dot{\mathbf{r}}\),

(2.5)

where \(\dot{\mathbf{r}}\)'s the unit vector along OP\({}^{\prime}\). Work done against this force from \(\mathbf{r}\)' to \(\mathbf{r}\)' + \(\Delta\mathbf{r}\)' is

\[\Delta W=-\frac{\mathcal{G}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{\alpha}}\Delta r^{\prime} \tag{2.6}\]

The negative sign appears because for \(\Delta r^{\prime}<0\), \(\Delta W\) is positive. Total work done (W) by the external force is obtained by integrating Eq. (2.6) from \(r^{\prime}\)= \(\infty\) to \(r^{\prime}\)= \(r\),

\[W=-\frac{\dot{r}}{\tau}\frac{\mathcal{G}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{\alpha}}2dr^{ \prime}=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{\prime}}\bigg{|}^{r}_{-}=\frac{ \mathcal{G}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \tag{2.7}\]

This, by definition is the potential at P due to the charge \(\mathcal{G}\)

\[V(r)=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \tag{2.8}\]

Figure 2.2: Work done on a test charge \(q\) by the electrostatic field due to any given charge configuration is independent of the path, and depends only on its initial and final positions.

Figure 2.3: Work done in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to the point P, against the repulsive force of charge \(\mathcal{G}\) (\(\mathcal{G}>0\)), is the potential at P due to the change \(\mathcal{G}\).

Equation (2.8) is true for any sign of the charge \(\mathcal{G}\), though we considered \(\mathcal{G}>0\) in its derivation. For \(\mathcal{G}<0\), \(V<0\), i.e., work done (by the external force) per unit positive test charge in bringing it from infinity to the point is negative. This is equivalent to saying that work done by the electrostatic force in bringing the unit positive charge form infinity to the point P is positive. [This is as it should be, since for \(\mathcal{G}<0\), the force on a unit positive test charge is attractive, so that the electrostatic force and the displacement (from infinity to P) are in the same direction.] Finally, we note that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with the choice that potential at infinity be zero.

Figure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential (\(\propto 1/r\)) and the electrostatic field (\(\propto 1/r^{2}\)) varies with \(r\).

### Potential due to an Electric Dipole

As we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges \(q\) and \(-q\) separated by a (small) distance \(2a\). Its total charge is zero. It is characterised by a dipole moment vector \(\mathbf{p}\) whose magnitude is \(q\times 2a\) and which points in the direction from \(-q\) to \(q\) (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that the electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) depends not just on the magnitude \(r\), but also on the angle between \(\mathbf{r}\) and \(\mathbf{p}\). Further,the field falls off, at large distance, not as \(1/r^{2}\) (typical of field due to a single charge) but as \(1/r^{3}\). We, now, determine the electric potential due to a dipole and contrast it with the potential due to a single charge.

As before, we take the origin at the centre of the dipole. Now we know that the electric field obeys the superposition principle. Since potential is related to the work done by the field, electrostatic potential also follows the superposition principle. Thus, the potential due to the dipole is the sum of potentials due to the charges \(q\) and \(-q\)

\[V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{q}{r_{1}}-\frac{q}{r_{2}}\right) \tag{9}\]

where \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) are the distances of the point P from \(q\) and \(-q\), respectively.

Now, by geometry,

\[r_{1}^{2}=r^{2}+a^{2}-2ar\cos\theta\]

\[r_{2}^{2}=r^{2}+a^{2}+2ar\,\cos\theta \tag{10}\]

We take \(r\) much greater than \(a\,(r>>a)\) and retain terms only upto the first order in \(a/r\)

\[r_{1}^{2}=r^{2}\left(1-\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r}+\frac{\alpha^{2}}{r^{2}}\right)\]

\[\cong r^{2}\left(1-\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r}\right) \tag{11}\]

Similarly,

\[r_{2}^{2}\cong r^{2}\left(1+\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r}\right) \tag{12}\]

Using the Binomial theorem and retaining terms upto the first order in \(a/r\) ; we obtain,

\[\frac{1}{r_{1}}\cong\frac{1}{r}\left(1-\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r} \right)^{-1/2}\cong\frac{1}{r}\left(1+\frac{\alpha}{r}\cos\theta\right) \tag{13a}\] \[\cdot\] \[\frac{1}{r_{2}}\cong\frac{1}{r}\left(1+\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r} \right)^{-1/2}\cong\frac{1}{r}\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{r}\cos\theta\right) \tag{13b}\]

Using Eqs. (9) and (13) and \(p=2qa\), we get

\[V=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{2a\cos\theta}{r^{2}}=\frac{p\cos\theta}{4 \pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}} \tag{14}\]

Now, \(p\cos\theta=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{\dot{r}}\)

Figure 5: Quantities involved in the calculation of potential due to a dipole.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:464]

\[=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\Bigg{(}\frac{q_{t}}{r_{\rm tr}}+\frac{q_{t}}{r_{\rm Zp }}+......+\frac{q_{n}}{r_{\rm np}}\Bigg{)} \tag{2.18}\]

If we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge density \(\rho\) (**r**), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of size \(\Delta\upsilon\) and carrying a charge \(\rho\Delta\upsilon\). We then determine the potential due to each volume element and sum (strictly speaking, integrate) over all such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire distribution.

We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated at the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by

\[V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q}{r}\quad\mbox{\rm\small$\left(r\geq R \right)$}\] (2.19a) where \(q\) is the total charge on the shell and \(R\) its radius. The electric field inside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant inside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell), and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is \[V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q}{R} \tag{2.19b}\]

**Example 2.2** Two charges \(3\times 10^{-8}\) C and -\(2\times 10^{-8}\) C are located 15 cm apart. At what point on the line joining the two charges is the electric potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.

**Solution** Let us take the origin O at the location of the positive charge. The line joining the two charges is taken to be the _x_-axis: the negative charge is taken to be on the right side of the origin (Fig. 2.7).

**FIGURE 2.7**

Let P be the required point on the _x_-axis where the potential is zero. If \(x\) is the _x_-coordinate of P, obviously \(x\) must be positive. (There is no possibility of potentials due to the two charges adding up to zero for \(x\) < 0.) If \(x\) lies between O and A, we have \[\frac{3\times 10^{-8}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left[\frac{3\times 10^{-8}}{x\times 10^{ -2}}-\frac{2\times 10^{-8}}{(15-x)\times 10^{-2}}\right]=0\] where \(x\) is in cm. That is, \[\frac{3}{x}-\frac{2}{15-x}=0\] which gives \(x\) = 9 cm. If \(x\) lies on the extended line OA, the required condition is \[\frac{3}{x}-\frac{2}{x-15}=0\]

3. Give the sign of the potential energy difference of a small negative charge between the points \(\text{G}\) and P; A and B.
4. Give the sign of the work done by the field in moving a small positive charge from \(\text{G}\) to P.
5. Give the sign of the work done by the external agency in moving a small negative charge from B to A.
6. Does the kinetic energy of a small negative charge increase or decrease in going from B to A?

**Solution**

1. [label=()]
2. As \(V\!\approx\!\frac{1}{r}\), \(V_{\text{p}}\!>\!V_{\text{G}}\) Thus, (\(V_{\text{p}}\!-\!V_{\text{G}}\)) is positive. Also \(V_{\text{B}}\) is less negative than \(V_{\text{A}}\). Thus, \(V_{\text{B}}\!>\!V_{\text{A}}\) or (\(V_{\text{B}}\!-\!V_{\text{A}}\)) is positive.
3. A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge. The negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower potential energy. Therefore the sign of potential energy difference of a small negative charge between \(\text{G}\) and P is positive. Similarly, (\(\text{P.E.}_{\text{A}}\)\(>\)\((\text{P.E.}_{\text{B}}\)) and hence sign of potential energy differences is positive.
4. In moving a small positive charge from \(\text{G}\) to P, work has to be done by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore, work done by the field is negative.
5. In moving a small negative charge from B to A work has to be done by the external agency. It is positive.
6. Due to force of repulsion on the negative charge, velocity decreases and hence the kinetic energy decreases in going from B to A.

### 2.6 Equipotential Surfaces

An equipotential surface is a surface with a constant value of potential at all points on the surface. For a single charge \(q\), the potential is given by Eq. (2.8):

\[V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}}\frac{q}{r}\]

This shows that \(V\) is a constant if \(r\) is constant. Thus, equipotential surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred at the charge.

Now the electric field lines for a single charge \(q\) are radial lines starting from or ending at the charge, depending on whether \(q\) is positive or negative. Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface passing through that point. This is true in general: _for any charge configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field at that point._ The proof of this statement is simple.

If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to be done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential surface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the surface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface. The electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface at every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture in addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge configuration.

For a uniform electric field **E**, say, along the \(x\)-axis, the equipotential surfaces are planes normal to the \(x\)-axis, i.e., planes parallel to the \(y\)-**z** plane (Fig. 2.10). Equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole and (b) two identical positive charges are shown in Fig. 2.11.

Figure 2.10: Equipotential surfaces for a uniform electric field.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:468]

where \(r_{12}\) is the distance between points 1 and 2.

Since electrostatic force is conservatve, this work gets stored in the form of potential energy of the system. Thus, the potential energy of a system of two charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) is

\[U=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}} \tag{22}\]

Obviously, if \(q_{2}\) was brought first to its present location and \(q_{1}\) brought later, the potential energy \(U\)would be the same. More generally, the potential energy expression, Eq. (22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified locations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force.

Equation (22) is true for any sign of \(q_{1}\)and \(q_{2}\). If \(q_{1}q_{2}>0\), potential energy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges [\(q_{1}q_{2}>0\)), electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to be done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite distance apart. For unlike charges [\(q_{1}q_{2}<0\)), the electrostatic force is attractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this force to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words, a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to the present locations), so the potential energy is negative.

Equation (22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of point charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\) and \(q_{3}\) located at \(\mathbf{r}_{1}\), \(\mathbf{r}_{2}\), \(\mathbf{r}_{3}\), respectively. To bring \(q_{1}\) first from infinity to \(\mathbf{r}_{1}\), no work is required. Next we bring \(q_{2}\)from infinity to \(\mathbf{r}_{2}\). As before, work done in this step is

\[q_{2}V_{1}(\mathbf{r}_{2})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}} \tag{23}\]

The charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\)produce a potential, which at any point P is given by

\[V_{1,2}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{q_{1}}{r_{12}}+\frac{q_{2}}{r_{ 2n}}\right) \tag{24}\]

Work done next in bringing \(q_{3}\)from infinity to the point \(\mathbf{r}_{3}\)is \(q_{3}\)times \(V_{1,2}\)at \(\mathbf{r}_{3}\)

\[q_{3}V_{1,2}(\mathbf{r}_{3})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{q_{1}q_{3} }{r_{13}}+\frac{q_{2}q_{3}}{r_{23}}\right) \tag{25}\]

The total work done in assembling the charges at the given locations is obtained by adding the work done in different steps [Eq. (23) and Eq. (25)].

\[U=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}}+\frac{q_{1}q_{3} }{r_{13}}+\frac{q_{2}q_{3}}{r_{23}}\right) \tag{26}\]

Again, because of the conservative nature of the electrostatic force (or equivalently, the path independence of work done), the final expression for \(U\), Eq. (26), is independent of the manner in which the configuration is assembled. _The potential energy

Figure 13: Potential energy of a system of charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) is directly proportional to the product of charges and inversely to the distance between them.

is characteristic of the present state of configuration, and not the way the state is achieved._

**Example 2.4**: Four charges are arranged at the corners of a square ABCD of side \(d\), as shown in Fig. 2.15.(a) Find the work required to put together this arrangement. (b) A charge \(q_{0}\) is brought to the centre E of the square, the four charges being held fixed at its corners. How much extra work is needed to do this?

**Solution**

(a) Since the work done depends on the final arrangement of the charges, and not on how they are put together, we calculate work needed for one way of putting the charges at A, B, C and D. Suppose, first the charge \(+q\) is brought to A, and then the charges \(-q\). \(+q\). and \(-q\) are brought to B, C and D, respectively. The total work needed can be calculated in steps:

(i) Work needed to bring charge \(+q\) to A when no charge is present elsewhere: this is zero.

(ii) Work needed to bring \(-q\) to B when \(+q\) is at A. This is given by (charge at B) \(\times\) (electrostatic potential at B due to charge \(+q\) at A)

\(=-q\times\left(\frac{q}{4\pi e_{0}d}\right)=-\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi e_{0}d}\)

(iii) Work needed to bring charge \(+q\) to C when \(+q\) is at A and \(-q\) is at B. This is given by (charge at C) \(\times\) (potential at C due to charges at A and B)

\(=+q\left(\frac{+q}{4\pi e_{0}d\sqrt{2}}+\frac{-q}{4\pi e_{0}d}\right)\)

\(=\frac{-q^{2}}{4\pi e_{0}d}\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\)

(iv) Work needed to bring \(-q\) to D when \(+q\) at A.-\(q\) at B, and \(+q\) at C. This is given by (charge at D) \(\times\) [potential at D due to charges at A, B and C]

\(=-q\left(\frac{+q}{4\pi e_{0}d}+\frac{-q}{4\pi e_{0}d\sqrt{2}}+\frac{q}{4\pi e _{0}d}\right)\)

\(=\frac{-q^{2}}{4\pi e_{0}d}\left(2-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\)

### Potential Energy in an External Field

#### Potential energy of a single charge

In Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified - the charges and their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges was determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question. What is the potential energy of a charge \(q\) in a given field? This question was, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic potential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again to clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.

The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential energy of a charge (or charges) in an _external_ field. The external field \(\mathbf{E}\) is _not_ produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to calculate. \(\mathbf{E}\) is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The external sources may be known, but often they are unknown or unspecified; what is specified is the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) or the electrostatic potential \(V\) due to the external sources. We assume that the charge \(q\) does not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This is true if \(q\) is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other unspecified forces. Even if \(q\) is finite, its influence on the external sources may still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away at infinity produce a finite field \(\mathbf{E}\) in the region of interest. Note again that we are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge \(q\) (and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested in the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.

The external electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) and the corresponding external potential \(V\) may vary from point to point. By definition, \(V\) at a point \(\mathrm{P}\) is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point \(\mathrm{P}\)(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in bringing a charge \(q\) from infinity to the point P in the external field is q \(V\). This work is stored in the form of potential energy of \(q\). If the point P has position vector **r** relative to some origin, we can write:

Potential energy of \(q\) at **r** in an external field

\[=qV(\textbf{r}) \tag{2.27}\]

where \(V(\textbf{r})\) is the external potential at the point **r**.

Thus, if an electron with charge \(q=e=1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C is accelerated by a potential difference of \(\Delta V=1\) volt, it would gain energy of \(q\Delta V=1.6\times 10^{-19}\)J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 _electron volt_ or 1eV, i.e., 1 eV=\(1.6\times 10^{-19}\)J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = \(10^{3}\)eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-16}\)J, 1 MeV = \(10^{6}\)eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-13}\)J, 1 GeV = \(10^{9}\)eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-10}\)J and 1 TeV = \(10^{12}\)eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-7}\)J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics Part I, Table 6.1.]

#### 2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an external field

Next, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) located at **r\({}_{1}\)**and **r\({}_{2}\)**, respectively, in an external field? First, we calculate the work done in bringing the charge \(q_{1}\) from infinity to **r\({}_{1}\)**. Work done in this step is \(q_{1}\)\(V(\textbf{r}_{1})\), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the work done in bringing \(q_{2}\)to **r\({}_{2}\)**. In this step, work is done not only against the external field **E** but also against the field due to \(q_{1}\).

Work done on \(q_{2}\) against the external field

\[=q_{2}\)\(V(\textbf{r}_{2})\]

Work done on \(q_{2}\) against the field due to \(q_{1}\)

\[=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi e_{q}r_{12}}\]

where \(r_{12}\)is the distance between \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\). We have made use of Eqs. (2.27) and (2.22). By the superposition principle for fields, we add up the work done on \(q_{2}\) against the two fields (**E** and that due to \(q_{1}\)):

Work done in bringing \(q_{2}\) to **r\({}_{2}\)**

\[=q_{2}V(\textbf{r}_{2})+\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi e_{q}r_{12}} \tag{2.28}\]

Thus,

Potential energy of the system

= the total work done in assembling the configuration

\[=q_{1}V(\textbf{r}_{1})+q_{2}V(\textbf{r}_{2})+\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi e_{q}r _{12}} \tag{2.29}\]

**Example 2.5**:
1. Determine the electrostatic potential energy of a system consisting of two charges 7 \(\mu\)C and -2 \(\mu\)C (and with no external field) placed at (-9 cm, 0, 0) and (9 cm, 0, 0) respectively.
2. How much work is required to separate the two charges infinitely away from each other?

**Figure 2.16** Potential energy of a dipole in a uniform external field.

This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can then associate potential energy \(U(\theta)\) with an inclination \(\theta\) of the dipole. Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the angle where the potential energy \(U\) is taken to be zero. A natural choice is to take \(\theta_{0}=\pi/2\). (An explanation for it is provided towards the end of discussion.) We can then write,

\[U(\theta)=pE\left(\cos\frac{\pi}{2}-\cos\theta\right)=-pE\cos\theta=-\textbf{p -E} \tag{2.32}\]This expression can alternately be understood also from Eq. (2.29). We apply Eq. (2.29) to the present system of two charges +\(q\) and -\(q\). The potential energy expression then reads

\[U^{\prime}(\theta)=q[V(\mathbf{r}_{1})-V(\mathbf{r}_{2})]-\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}\times 2\alpha} \tag{2.33}\]

Here, \(\mathbf{r_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{r_{2}}\) denote the position vectors of +\(q\) and -\(q\). Now, the potential difference between positions \(\mathbf{r_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{r_{2}}\) equals the work done in bringing a unit positive charge against field from \(\mathbf{r_{2}}\) to \(\mathbf{r_{1}}\). The displacement parallel to the force is \(2\alpha\) cos\(\theta\). Thus, [\(V(\mathbf{r_{1}})\)-\(V(\mathbf{r_{2}})\)] = -\(E\times 2\alpha\cos\theta\). We thus obtain,

\[U^{\prime}(\theta)=-pE\cos\theta-\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\times 2\alpha}=- \mathbf{p}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{E}-\frac{q^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\times 2\alpha} \tag{2.34}\]

We note that \(U(\theta)\) differs from \(U(\theta)\) by a quantity which is just a constant for a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential energy, we can drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32).

We can now understand why we took \(\theta_{0}\)=\(\pi\)/2. In this case, the work done against the _external_ field \(\mathbf{E}\) in bringing +\(q\) and - \(q\) are equal and opposite and cancel out, i.e., \(q\left[V(\mathbf{r_{1}})\right]-V(\mathbf{r_{2}})\)]=0.

**Example 2.6** A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric dipole moment of magnitude \(10^{-29}\) C m. A mole of this substance is polarised at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field of magnitude \(10^{6}\) V m\({}^{-1}\). The direction of the field is suddenly changed by an angle of \(60^{\circ}\). Estimate the heat released by the substance in aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity, assume 100% polarisation of the sample.

**Solution** Here, dipole moment of each molecules = \(10^{-29}\) C m

As 1 mole of the substance contains \(6\times 10^{23}\) molecules,

total dipole moment of all the molecules, \(p=6\times 10^{23}\times 10^{-29}\) C m

\(=6\times 10^{-6}\) C m

Initial potential energy, \(U_{t}=-pE\cos\theta=-6\times 10^{6}\times 10^{6}\cos 0^{\circ}\) = -6 J

Final potential energy (when \(\theta=60^{\circ}\)), \(U_{t}=-6\times 10^{6}\times 10^{6}\cos 60^{\circ}\) = -3 J

Change in potential energy = -3 J - (-6J) = 3 J

So, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released by the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.

### Electrostatics of Conductors

Conductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1. Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these charge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons part away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free within the metal but not free to leave the metal. The free electrons form a kind of 'gas'; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move randomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift against the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic conductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but the situation in this case is more involved - the movement of the charge carriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the so-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion to metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding electrostatics of conductors.

## 1 Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero

Consider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external electrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside or on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere inside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a conductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the electric field is zero everywhere inside. _Electrostatic field is zero inside a conductor_.

At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field must be normal to the surface at every point

If **E** were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero component along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor would then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore, **E** should have no tangential component. Thus _electrostatic field at the surface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every point._ (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero even at the surface.) See result 5.

## 3 The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in the static situation

A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges in every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged, the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation. This follows from the Gauss's law. Consider any arbitrary volume element \(v\) inside a conductor. On the closed surface \(S\) bounding the volume element \(v\), electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through \(S\) is zero. Hence, by Gauss's law, there is no net charge enclosed by \(S\). But the surface \(S\) can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume \(v\) can be made vanishingly small. This means _there is no net charge at any point inside the conductor_, and _any excess charge must reside at the surface_.

Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on its surface

This follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since **E** = 0 inside the conductor and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That is, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on the surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,electric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be different for the surface and a point just outside the surface.

In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and charge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant value of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to the other.

## 5 Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor

\[\mathbf{E}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \tag{35}\]

where \(\sigma\) is the surface charge density and \(\mathbf{\hat{n}}\) is a unit vector normal to the surface in the outward direction.

To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian surface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 17. The pill box is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It has a small area of cross section \(\delta\)S and negligible height.

Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the field is normal to the surface with magnitude \(E\). Thus, the contribution to the total flux through the pill box comes only from the outside (circular) cross-section of the pill box. This equals \(\pm E\delta\)S (positive for \(\sigma>0\), negative for \(\sigma<0\)), since over the small area \(\delta\)S, \(\mathbf{E}\) may be considered constant and \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\delta\)S are parallel or antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box is \(\sigma\delta\)S.

By Gauss's law

\[E\delta\mathbf{S}=\frac{\left|\sigma\right|\delta S}{\epsilon_{0}}\]

\[E=\frac{\left|\sigma\right|}{\epsilon_{0}} \tag{36}\]

Including the fact that electric field is normal to the surface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (35), which is true for both signs of \(\sigma\). For \(\sigma>0\), electric field is normal to the surface outward; for \(\sigma<0\), electric field is normal to the surface inward.

## 6 Electrostatic shielding

Consider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A remarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever be the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the conductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have proved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged spherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of the spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of electric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned above, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor

Figure 17: The Gaussian surface (a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (35) for electric field at the surface of a charged conductor.

is charged or charges are induced on a neutral conductor by an external field, all charges reside only on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.

The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are omitted here, but we note their important implication. Whatever be the charge and field configuration outside, any cavity in a conductor remains shielded from outside electric influence: _the field inside the cavity is always zero._ This is known as _electrostatic shielding_. The effect can be made use of in protecting sensitive instruments from outside electrical influence. Figure 2.19 gives a summary of the important electrostatic properties of a conductor.

**Example 2.7**:
1. A comb run through one's dry hair attracts small bits of paper. Why? What happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day? (Remember, a paper does not conduct electricity.)
2. Ordinary rubber is an insulator. But special rubber tyres of aircraft are made slightly conducting. Why is this necessary?
3. Vehicles carrying inflammmable materials usually have metallic ropes touching the ground during motion. Why?
4. A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens to the bird. A man standing on the ground touches the same line and gets a fatal shock. Why?

**Solution**:
1. This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The molecules in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting in a net force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction between hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get charged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper.

### 2.10 Dielectrics and Polarisation

Dielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors, they have no (or negligible number of) charge carriers. Recall from Section 2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an external electric field. The free charge carriers move and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts itself in such a way that the electric field due to induced charges opposes the external field within the conductor. This happens until, in the static situation, the two fields cancel each other and the net electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a dielectric, this free movement of charges is not possible. It turns out that the external field induces dipole moment by stretching or re-orienting molecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all the molecular dipole moments is not charges on the surface of the dielectric which produce a field that opposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor, however, the opposing field so induced does not exactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it. The extent of the effect depends on the nature of the dielectric. To understand the effect, we need to look at the charge distribution of a dielectric at the molecular level.

The molecules of a substance may be polar or non-polar. In a non-polar molecule, the centres of positive and negative charges coincide. The molecule then has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole moment. Examples of non-polar molecules are oxygen (O\({}_{2}\)) and hydrogen (H\({}_{2}\)) molecules which, because of their symmetry, have no dipole moment. On the other hand, a polar molecule is one in which the centres of positive and negative charges are separated (even when there is no external field). Such molecules have a permanent dipole moment. An ionic molecule such as HCl or a molecule of water (H\({}_{2}\)O) are examples of polar molecules.

In an external electric field, the positive and negative charges of a non-polar molecule are displaced in opposite directions. The displacement stops when the external force on the constituent charges of the molecule is balanced by the restoring force (due to internal fields in the molecule). The non-polar molecule thus develops an induced dipole moment. The dielectric is said to be polarised by the external field. We consider only the simple situation when the induced dipole moment is in the direction of the field and is proportional to the field strength. (Substances for which this assumption is true are called _linear isotropic dielectrics_.) The induced dipole moments of different molecules add up giving a net dipole moment of the dielectric in the presence of the external field.

A dielectric with polar molecules also develops a net dipole moment in an external field, but for a different reason. In the absence of any external field, the different permanent dipoles are oriented randomly due to thermal agitation; so the total dipole moment is zero. When an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend to align with the field. When summed over all the molecules, there is then a net dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of two mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external field tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending to disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the 'induced dipole moment' effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment effect is more important for polar molecules.

Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole moment per unit volume is called _polarisation_ and is denoted by **P**. For linear isotropic dielectrics,

\[\textbf{P}=\chi_{e}\,\textbf{E} \tag{37}\]

where \(\chi_{e}\) is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the _electric susceptibility_ of the dielectric medium.

It is possible to relate \(\chi_{e}\) to the molecular properties of the substance, but we shall not pursue that here.

The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original external field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular dielectric slab placed in a uniform external field \(\textbf{E}_{0}\) parallel to two of its faces. The field causes a uniform polarisation **P** of the dielectric. Thus

Figure 22: A dielectric develops a net dipole moment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar molecules, (b) Polar molecules.

every volume element \(\Delta\)_u_ of the slab has a dipole moment **P**_Au_ in the direction of the field. The volume element \(\Delta\)_v_ is macroscopically small but contains a very large number of molecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the volume element \(\Delta\)_u_ has no net charge (though it has net dipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole. However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the electric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at the left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced charges due to the external field.

Thus the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say \(\sigma_{p}\) and \(-\sigma_{p}\). Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges opposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric is, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is present. We should note that the surface charge density \(\pm\sigma_{p}\) arises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.

### Capacitors and Capacitance

A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator (Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say \(\mathcal{Q}_{\mathrm{i}}\) and \(\mathcal{Q}_{\mathrm{z}}\), and potentials \(V_{\mathrm{i}}\) and \(V_{\mathrm{z}}\). Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges \(\mathcal{Q}\) and \(-\mathcal{Q}\), with potential difference \(V=V_{\mathrm{i}}-V_{\mathrm{z}}\) between them. We shall consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at infinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the two terminals of a battery. \(\mathcal{Q}\) is called the charge of the capacitor, though this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors - the total charge of the capacitor is zero.

The electric field in the region between the conductors is proportional to the charge \(\mathcal{Q}\). That is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say doubled, the electric field will also be doubled at every point. [This follows from the direct proportionality between field and charge implied by Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.] Now, potential difference \(V\) is the work done per unit positive charge in taking a small test charge from the conductor 2 to 1 against the field. Consequently, \(V\) is also proportional to \(\mathcal{Q}\), and the ratio \(\mathcal{Q}/V\)is a constant:

\[C=\frac{\mathcal{Q}}{V} \tag{2.38}\]

The constant C is called the _capacitance_ of the capacitor. C is independent of \(\mathcal{Q}\) or \(V\), as stated above. The capacitance \(C\) depends only on the

Figure 2.24: A system of two conductors separated by an insulator forms a capacitor.

Figure 2.23: A uniformly polarised dielectric amounts to induced surface charge density, but no volume charge density.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:481]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:482]

and the potential difference \(V_{0}\)is

\(V_{0}=E_{0}d\)

The capacitance \(C_{0}\) in this case is

\(C_{0}=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{V_{0}}=\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{A}{d}\)

Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying the intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, as explained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets (at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge densities \(\sigma_{p}\) and \(-\sigma_{p}\). The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds to the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is \(\pm\{\sigma-\sigma_{p}\}\). That is,

\[E=\frac{\sigma-\sigma_{p}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \tag{2.47}\]

so that the potential difference across the plates is

\[V=E\,d=\frac{\sigma-\sigma_{p}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\,d \tag{2.48}\]

For linear dielectrics, we expect \(\sigma_{p}\) to be proportional to \(E_{0}\), i.e., to \(\sigma\). Thus, \((\sigma-\sigma_{p})\)is proportional to \(\sigma\) and we can write

\[\sigma-\sigma_{p}=\frac{\sigma}{K} \tag{2.49}\]

where \(K\) is a constant characteristic of the dielectric. Clearly, \(K>1\). We then have

\[V=\frac{\sigma d}{\varepsilon_{0}K}=\frac{\mathcal{G}d}{A\varepsilon_{0}K} \tag{2.50}\]

The capacitance C, with dielectric between the plates, is then

\[C=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{V}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}KA}{d} \tag{2.51}\]

The product \(\varepsilon_{0}K\) is called the _permittivity_ of the medium and is denoted by \(\varepsilon\)

\(\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}\,K\)

For vacuum \(K=1\) and \(\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}\); \(\varepsilon_{0}\) is called the _permittivity of the vacuum_. The dimensionless ratio

\[K=\frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_{0}} \tag{2.53}\]

is called the _dielectric constant_ of the substance. As remarked before, from Eq. (2.49), it is clear that \(K\) is greater than 1. From Eqs. (2.46) and (2. 51)

\[K=\frac{C}{C_{0}} \tag{2.54}\]

Thus, the dielectric constant of a substance is the factor (>1) by which the capacitance increases from its vacuum value, when the dielectric is inserted fully between the plates of a capacitor. Though we arrived at Eq. (2.54) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, it holds good for any type of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition of the dielectric constant of a substance.

We have introduced the notion of dielectric constant and arrived at Eq. (2.54), without giving the explicit relation between the induced charge density \(\sigma_{\rm p}\) and the polarisation **P**.

We take without proof the result that

\(\sigma_{\rm p}=\textbf{P}\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}}\)

where \(\hat{\textbf{n}}\) is a unit vector along the outward normal to the surface. Above equation is general, true for any shape of the dielectric. For the slab in Fig. 2.23, **P** is along \(\hat{\textbf{n}}\) at the right surface and opposite to \(\hat{\textbf{n}}\) at the left surface. Thus at the right surface, induced charge density is positive and at the left surface, it is negative, as guessed already in our qualitative discussion before. Putting the equation for electric field in vector form

\(\textbf{E}\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}}=\dfrac{\sigma-\textbf{P}\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}} }{\varepsilon_{0}}\)

or \((\varepsilon_{0}\textbf{E}+\textbf{P})\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}}=\sigma\)

The quantity \(\varepsilon_{0}\textbf{E}+\textbf{P}\) is called the _electric displacement_ and is denoted by **D**. It is a vector quantity. Thus,

\(\textbf{D}=\varepsilon_{0}\textbf{E}+\textbf{P}\), \(\textbf{D}\cdot\hat{\textbf{n}}=\sigma\),

The significance of **D** is this : in vacuum, **E** is related to the free charge density \(\sigma\). When a dielectric medium is present, the corresponding role is taken up by **D**. For a dielectric medium, it is **D** not **E** that is directly related to free charge density \(\sigma\), as seen in above equation. Since **P** is in the same direction as **E**, all the three vectors **P**, **E** and **D** are parallel.

The ratio of the magnitudes of **D** and **E** is

\(\dfrac{D}{E}=\dfrac{\sigma\varepsilon_{0}}{\sigma-\sigma_{p}}=\varepsilon_{0}K\)

Thus,

\(\textbf{D}=\varepsilon_{0}\,K\textbf{E}\)

and \(\textbf{P}=\textbf{D}-\varepsilon_{0}\textbf{E}=\varepsilon_{0}\)\((K-1)\textbf{E}\)

This gives for the electric susceptibility \(\chi_{e}\) defined in Eq. (2.37)

\(\chi_{e}=\varepsilon_{0}\) (K-1)

**Example 2.8**: A slab of material of dielectric constant \(K\) has the same area as the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor but has a thickness \((3/4)d\), where \(d\) is the separation of the plates. How is the capacitance changed when the slab is inserted between the plates?
**Solution** Let \(E_{0}=V_{o}/d\) be the electric field between the plates when there is no dielectric and the potential difference is \(V_{o}\). If the dielectric is now inserted, the electric field in the dielectric will be \(E=E_{0}/K\). The potential difference will then be \(V=E_{0}(\frac{1}{4}d)+\frac{E_{0}}{K}(\frac{3}{4}d)\)

\(=E_{0}d(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4K})=V_{0}\)\(\frac{K+3}{4K}\)

The potential difference decreases by the factor \((K+3)/4K\) while the free charge \(Q_{0}\) on the plates remains unchanged. The capacitance thus increases

\(C=\frac{Q_{0}}{V}=\frac{4K}{K+3}\frac{Q_{0}}{V_{0}}=\frac{4K}{K+3}C_{0}\)

### 2.14 Combination of Capacitors

We can combine several capacitors of capacitance \(C_{1}\), \(C_{2}\),..., \(C_{n}\) to obtain a system with some effective capacitance \(C\). The effective capacitance depends on the way the individual capacitors are combined. Two simple possibilities are discussed below.

#### 2.14.1 Capacitors in series

Figure 2.26 shows capacitors \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) combined in series.

The left plate of \(C_{1}\) and the right plate of \(C_{2}\) are connected to two terminals of a battery and have charges \(Q\) and \(-Q\), respectively. It then follows that the right plate of \(C_{1}\) has charge \(-Q\) and the left plate of \(C_{2}\) has charge \(Q\). If this was not so, the net charge on each capacitor would not be zero. This would result in an electric field in the conductor connecting \(C_{1}\)and \(C_{2}\). Charge would flow until the net charge on both \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) is zero and there is no electric field in the conductor connecting \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\). Thus, in the series combination, charges on the two plates (\(\pm Q\)) are the same on each capacitor. The total potential drop \(V\) across the combination is the sum of the potential drops \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) across \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\), respectively.

\[V=V_{1}+V_{2}=\frac{Q}{C_{1}}+\frac{Q}{C_{2}} \tag{2.55}\]

\(\frac{\cdot}{Q}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}\), (2.56)

Now we can regard the combination as an effective capacitor with charge \(Q\) and potential difference \(V\). The _effective capacitance_ of the combination is

\(C=\frac{Q}{V}\) (2.57)

We compare Eq. (2.57) with Eq. (2.56), and obtain

\[\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}} \tag{2.58}\]The proof clearly goes through for any number of capacitors arranged in a similar way. Equation (2.55), for \(n\) capacitors arranged in series, generalises to

\[V=V_{1}+V_{2}+...+V_{n}=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{C_{1}}+\frac{\mathcal{G}}{C_{2}}+...+ \frac{\mathcal{G}}{C_{n}} \tag{2.59}\]

Following the same steps as for the case of two capacitors, we get the general formula for effective capacitance of a series combination of \(n\) capacitors:

\[\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\frac{1}{C_{3}}+...+\frac{1}{C_{n}} \tag{2.60}\]

#### 2.14.2 Capacitors in paralle

Figure 2.28 (a) shows two capacitors arranged in parallel. In this case, the same potential difference is applied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges (\(\neq\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}\)) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (\(\neq\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}\)) on the capacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:

\[\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}=C_{1}V,\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}=C_{2}V \tag{2.61}\]

The equivalent capacitor is one with charge

\[\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}+\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}} \tag{2.62}\]

and potential difference \(V\).

\[\mathcal{G}=CV=C_{1}V+C_{2}V \tag{2.63}\]

The effective capacitance \(C\) is, from Eq. (2.63),

\[C=C_{1}+C_{2} \tag{2.64}\]

The general formula for effective capacitance \(C\) for parallel combination of \(n\) capacitors [Fig. 2.28 (b)] follows similarly,

\[\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}+\mathcal{G}_{\text{J}}+...+\mathcal{G}_{ \text{J}} \tag{2.65}\]

i.e. \[C_{\text{J}}V=C_{1}V+C_{2}V^{\text{J}}+...C_{n}V\] (2.66)

which gives

\[C=C_{1}+C_{2}+...C_{n} \tag{2.67}\]

**Example 2.9** A network of four 10 uF capacitors is connected to a 500 V supply, as shown in Fig. 2.29. Determine (a) the equivalent capacitance of the network and (b) the charge on each capacitor. (Note, the _charge on a capacitor_ is the charge on the plate with higher potential, equal and opposite to the charge on the plate with lower potential.)

Figure 2.28: Parallel combination of (a) two capacitors, (b) n capacitors.

**Solution**

(a) In the given network, \(C_{1}\), \(C_{2}\) and \(C_{3}\) are connected in series. The effective capacitance \(C^{\prime}\) of these three capacitors is given by

\(\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\frac{1}{C_{3}}\)

For \(C_{1}=C_{2}=C_{3}=10\) uF, \(C^{\prime}=(10/3)\) uF. The network has \(C^{\prime}\) and \(C_{4}\) connected in parallel. Thus, the equivalent capacitance \(C\) of the network is

\(C=C^{\prime}+C_{4}=\left(\frac{10}{3}+10\right)\) uF =13.3uF

(b) Clearly, from the figure, the charge on each of the capacitors, \(C_{1}\), \(C_{2}\) and \(C_{3}\) is the same, say \(Q\). Let the charge on \(C_{4}\) be \(Q^{\prime}\). Now, since the potential difference across AB is \(Q/C_{1}\), across BC is \(Q/C_{2}\), across CD is \(Q/C_{3}\), we have

\(\frac{Q}{C_{1}}+\frac{Q}{C_{2}}+\frac{Q}{C_{3}}=500\) V

Also, \(Q^{\prime}/C_{4}=500\) V.

This gives for the given value of the capacitances,

\(Q=500\) V \(\times\frac{10}{3}\)uF = 1.7\(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\)C and

\(Q^{\prime}=500\) V \(\times\)10 uF = 5.0\(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) C

### Energy Stored in a Capacitor

A capacitor, as we have seen above, is a system of two conductors with charge \(Q\) and \(-Q\). To determine the energy stored in this configuration, consider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a process of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by bit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge \(Q\). By charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge \(-Q\) at the end (Fig 30 ).

In transferring positive charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than conductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first calculate the work done in a small step involving transfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small) amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation when the conductors 1 and 2 have charges \(Q^{\prime}\) and \(-Q^{\prime}\) respectively. At this stage, the potential difference \(V^{\prime}\)between conductors 1 to 2 is \(Q^{\prime}/C\), where \(C\) is the capacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small charge \(\delta Q^{\prime}\)is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work done in this step (\(\delta\,W\)), resulting in charge \(Q^{\prime}\) on conductor 1 increasing to \(Q^{\prime}+\delta\,Q^{\prime}\), is given by

\[\delta\,W=V^{\prime}\delta Q^{\prime}=\frac{Q^{\prime}}{C}\delta Q^{\prime} \tag{68}\]Since \(\delta Q^{\prime}\)can be made as small as we like, Eq. (68) can be written as

\[\delta W=\frac{1}{2C}[[Q^{\prime}+\delta Q^{\prime}]^{2}-Q^{\prime^{2}}] \tag{69}\]

Equations (68) and (69) are identical because the term of second order in \(\delta Q^{\prime}\), i.e., \(\delta Q^{\prime}{}^{2}/2C\), is negligible, since \(\delta Q^{\prime}\)is arbitrarily small. The total work done (\(W\)) is the sum of the small work (\(\delta W\)) over the very large number of steps involved in building the charge \(Q^{\prime}\)from zero to \(Q\).

\[W=\sum_{\text{sum over all steps}}\delta W\] \[=\sum_{\text{sum over all steps}}\frac{1}{2C}[[\delta Q^{\prime}+ \delta Q^{\prime}]^{2}-Q^{\prime^{2}}] \tag{70}\] \[=\frac{1}{2C}[[\delta Q^{\prime^{2}}-0]+\{[2\delta Q^{\prime}]^ {2}-\delta Q^{\prime^{2}}\}+\{[3\delta Q^{\prime}]^{2}-(2\delta Q)^{2}\}+...\] \[+[Q^{2}-(Q-\delta Q)^{2}]]\] (71) \[=\frac{1}{2C}[Q^{2}-0]=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C} \tag{72}\]

The same result can be obtained directly from Eq. (68) by integration.

\[W=\int\limits_{0}^{q}\frac{Q^{\prime}}{C}\delta Q^{\prime}-\frac{1}{C}\frac{ Q^{\prime^{2}}}{2}\Big{|}_{0}^{\theta}=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}\]

This is not surprising since integration is nothing but summation of a large number of small terms.

We can write the final result, Eq. (72) in different ways

\[W=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}=\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{G}V \tag{73}\]

Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form of potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the final result for potential energy [Eq. (73)] is independent of the manner in which the charge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor discharges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to view the potential energy of the capacitor as'stored' in the electric field between the plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor [of area A(of each plate) and separation \(d\) between the plates].

Energy stored in the capacitor

\[=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^{2}}{C}=\frac{(A\sigma)^{2}}{2}\times\frac{d}{\varepsilon_ {0}A} \tag{74}\]

The surface charge density \(\sigma\) is related to the electric field \(E\)between the plates,

\[E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}} \tag{75}\]

From Eqs. (74) and (75), we get

Energy stored in the capacitor

\[U=(1/2)\varepsilon_{0}E^{2}\times A\,d \tag{76}\]Note that \(Ad\) is the volume of the region between the plates (where electric field alone exists). If we define _energy density as energy stored per unit volume of space_, Eq (2.76) shows that

Energy density of electric field,

\[u=\)(1/2)\(\epsilon_{0}E^{2} \tag{2.77}\]

Though we derived Eq. (2.77) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, the result on energy density of an electric field is, in fact, very general and holds true for electric field due to any configuration of charges.

**Example 2.10** (a) A 900 pF capacitor is charged by 100 V battery [Fig. 2.31(a)]. How much electrostatic energy is stored by the capacitor? (b) The capacitor is disconnected from the battery and connected to another 900 pF capacitor [Fig. 2.31(b)]. What is the electrostatic energy stored by the system?

**Solution**

(a) The charge on the capacitor is

\(Q=CV=900\times 10^{.12}\) F \(\times\) 100 V = 9 \(\times\) 10\({}^{.8}\) C

The energy stored by the capacitor is

= (1/2) \(CV^{2}=\) (1/2) \(QV\)

= (1/2) \(\times\) 9 \(\times\) 10\({}^{.8}\) C \(\times\) 100 V = 4.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{.6}\) J

(b) In the steady situation, the two capacitors have their positive plates at the same potential, and their negative plates at the same potential. Let the common potential difference be V'. The charge on each capacitor is then \(Q^{\prime}=CV^{\prime}\). By charge conservation, \(Q^{\prime}=Q/2\). This implies \(V^{\prime}=V/2\). The total energy of the system is

\[=2\times\frac{1}{2}Q^{\prime}V^{\prime}=\frac{1}{4}Q^{\prime}=2.25\times 10^{.6}J\]

Thus in going from (a) to (b), though no charge is lost; the final energy is only half the initial energy. _Where has the remaining energy gone_?

There is a transient period before the system settles to the situation (b). During this period, a transient current flows from the first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time in the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation.

### Van De Graaff Generator

This is a machine that can build up high voltages of the order of a few million volts. The resulting large electric fields are used to accelerate charged particles (electrons, protons, ions) to high energies needed for experiments to probe the small scale structure of matter. The principle underlying the machine is as follows.

Suppose we have a large spherical conducting shell of radius \(R\), on which we place a charge \(\mathcal{G}\). This charge spreads itself uniformly all over the sphere. As we have seen in Section 1.14, the field outside the sphere is just that of a point charge \(\mathcal{G}\) at the centre; while the field inside the sphere vanishes. So the potential outside is that of a point charge; and inside it is constant, namely the value at the radius \(R\). We thus have:

Potential inside conducting spherical shell of radius \(R\) carrying charge \(\mathcal{G}\) = constant

\[=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{\mathcal{G}}{R} \tag{2.78}\]

Now, as shown in Fig. 2.32, let us suppose that in some way we introduce a small sphere of radius \(r\), carrying some charge \(q\), into the large one, and place it at the centre. The potential due to this new charge clearly has the following values at the radii indicated:

Potential due to small sphere of radius \(r\) carrying charge \(q\)

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{=}}\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r}\text{ at surface of small sphere}\] \[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{=}}\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{R}\text{ at large shell of radius }R. \tag{2.79}\]

Taking both charges \(q\) and \(\mathcal{G}\) into account we have for the total potential \(V\) and the potential difference the values

\[V(R) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{G}}{R}+\frac{q} {R}\right)\] \[V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{G}}{R}+\frac{q }{r}\right)\] \[V(r) - V(R) = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{R}\right) \tag{2.80}\]

Assume now that \(q\) is positive. We see that, independent of the amount of charge \(\mathcal{G}\) that may have accumulated on the larger sphere and even if it is positive, the inner sphere is always at a higher potential: the difference \(V(r)\)-\(V(R)\) is positive. The potential due to \(\mathcal{G}\) is constant upto radius \(R\) and so cancels out in the difference!

This means that if we now connect the smaller and larger sphere by a wire, the charge \(q\) on the former

Figure 2.32: Illustrating the principle of the electrostatic generator.

belt insulating material, like rubber or silk, is wound around two pulleys - one at ground level, one at the centre of the shell. This belt is kept continuously moving by a motor driving the lower pulley. It continuously carries positive charge, sprayed on to it by a brush at ground level, to the top. There it transfers its positive charge to another conducting brush connected to the large shell. Thus positive charge is transferred to the shell, where it spreads out uniformly on the outer surface. In this way, voltage differences of as much as 6 or 8 million volts (with respect to ground) can be built up.

## 25 Summary

1. Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external force (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge \(q\) from a point R to a point P is \(V_{p}-V_{\rm g}\) which is the difference in potential energy of charge \(q\) between the final and initial points.
2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential at infinity is chosen to be zero: potential at a point with position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) due to a point charge \(\mathcal{G}\) placed at the origin is given by \(V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi e_{\rm o}}\frac{\mathcal{G}}{r}\)
3. The electrostatic potential at a point with position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) due to a point dipole of dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}\) placed at the origin is \(V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi e_{\rm o}}\frac{\mathbf{p-f}}{r^{2}}\)

Figure 2.33: Principle of construction of Van de Graaff generator.

The result is true also for a dipole (with charges -\(q\) and \(q\) separated by 2\(d\)) for \(r>>a\).
4. For a charge configuration \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\),...., \(q_{n}\) with position vectors \(\mathbf{r}_{1}\), \(\mathbf{r}_{2}\),... \(\mathbf{r}_{n}\), the potential at a point P is given by the superposition principle

\[V=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}{\frac{q_{1}}{r_{\mathrm{z}p}}+\frac{q_{2}}{r_{ \mathrm{z}p}}+...+\frac{q_{n}}{r_{\mathrm{z}p}}}\]

where \(r_{\mathrm{z}p}\) is the distance between \(q_{1}\) and P, as and so on.
5. An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant value. For a point charge, concentric spheres centered at a location of the charge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. \(\mathbf{E}\) is in the direction of the steepest decrease of potential.
6. Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done (by an external agency) in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential energy of two charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\) at \(\mathbf{r}_{1}\), \(\mathbf{r}_{2}\) is given by \(\cdot\) where \(r_{\mathrm{z}p}\) is distance between \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\).
7. The potential energy of a charge \(q\) in an external potential \(V(\mathbf{r})\) is \(qV(\mathbf{r})\). The potential energy of a dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}\) in a uniform electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is -\(\mathbf{p}\)**-E**.
8. Electrostatics field \(\mathbf{E}\) is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside the surface of a charged conductor, \(\mathbf{E}\) is normal to the surface given by \(\mathbf{E}=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}\,\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) where \(\,\hat{\mathbf{n}}\) is the unit vector along the outward normal to the surface and \(\sigma\) is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface of a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the electric field is zero.
9. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its capacitance is defined by \(C=Q/V\), where \(Q\) and -\(Q\) are the charges on the two conductors and \(V\) is the potential difference between them. C is determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:, 1 F = 1 C V\({}^{-1}\). For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the plates), \(C=\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{A}{d}\) where \(A\) is the area of each plate and \(d\) the separation between them.
10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation, gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance \(C\) increases from its value \(C_{0}\) when there is no medium (vacuum), \(C=KC_{0}\) where \(K\) is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.

11. For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance \(C\) is given by \[\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}+\frac{1}{C_{3}}+...\] In the parallel combination, the total capacitance \(C\) is: \[C=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+...\] where \(C_{1}\), \(C_{2}\), \(C_{3}\)... are individual capacitances.
12. The energy \(U\) stored in a capacitor of capacitance \(C\), with charge \(Q\) and voltage \(V\) is \[U=\frac{1}{2}\,\mathcal{G}V=\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^{2}}{C}\] The electric energy density (energy per unit volume) in a region with electric field is \((1/2)e_{0}E^{2}\).
13. A Van de Graaff generator consists of a large spherical conducting shell (a few metre in diameter). By means of a moving belt and suitable brushes, charge is continuously transferred to the shell and potential difference of the order of several million volts is built up, which can be used for accelerating charged particles.

## 6 Points to Ponder

1. Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a force on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of electrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each charge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the net Coulomb force on the charge.
2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within a small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable strength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a capacitor is small.
3. Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged shell. It is zero inside and \(\frac{\textbf{g}}{\textbf{g}_{0}}\cdot\textbf{\hat{n}}\) outside. Electric potential is, however continuous across the surface, equal to \(q/4\pi\epsilon_{0}R\) at the surface.
4. The torque \(\textbf{p}\times\textbf{E}\) on a dipole causes it to oscillate about **E**. Only if there is a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole eventually aligns with **E**.

5. Potential due to a charge \(q\) at its own location is not defined - it is infinite.
6. In the expression \(qV(\textbf{r})\) for potential energy of a charge \(q\), \(V(\textbf{r})\) is the potential due to external charges and not the potential due to \(q\). As seen in point 5, this expression will be ill-defined if \(V(\textbf{r})\) includes potential due to a charge \(q\) itself.
7. A cavity inside a conductor is shielded from outside electrical influences. It is worth noting that electrostatic shielding does not work the other way round; that is, if you put charges inside the cavity, the exterior of the conductor is not shielded from the fields by the instde charges.

(Hint: The earth has an electric field of about 100 Vm\({}^{-1}\) at its surface in the downward direction, corresponding to a surface charge density = -10\({}^{-9}\) C m\({}^{-2}\). Due to the slight conductivity of the atmosphere up to about 50 km (beyond which it is good conductor), about + 1800 C is pumped every second into the earth as a whole. The earth, however, does not get discharged since thunderstorms and lightning occurring continually all over the globe pump an equal amount of negative charge on the earth.)

## Chapter Three

CURRENT

EECTRICITY

### 3.1 Introduction

In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

### 3.2 Electric Current

Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval \(t\), let \(q\), be the net amount (_i.e._, forward _minus_ backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let \(q\)_be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval \(t\), then, is \(q=q_{t}\)- \(q_{t}\). This is proportional to \(t\) for steady currentand the quotient

\[I=\frac{q}{t} \tag{1}\]

is defined to be the _current_ across the area in the forward direction. (If it turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward direction.)

Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as follows. Let \(\Delta Q\) be the net charge flowing across a cross-section of a conductor during the time interval \(\Delta t\) [i.e., between times \(t\) and \((t+\Delta t)\)]. Then, the current at time \(t\) across the cross-section of the conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of \(\Delta Q\) to \(\Delta t\) in the limit of \(\Delta t\) tending to zero,

\[I(t)=\lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \tag{2}\]

In SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.

### 3.3 Electric Currents in Conductors

An electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the _ionosphere_. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately \(10^{22}\) molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.

If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions.

Consider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the number of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number of electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net electric current.

Let us now see what happens to such a piece of conductor if an electric field is applied. To focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor in the shape of a cylinder of radius \(R\) (Fig. 1). Suppose we now take two thin circular discs of a dielectric of the same radius and put positive charge \(+\mathcal{G}\) distributed over one disc and similarly \(-\mathcal{G}\) at the other disc. We attach the two discs on the two flat surfaces of the cylinder. An electric field will be created and is directed from the positive towards the negative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards \(+\mathcal{G}\). They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long as they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the situation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no current thereafter.

We can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are supplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by electrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady electric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous current rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms, which maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall study later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady current that results from a steady electric field in conductors.

### Ohm's Law

A basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in 1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents was discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current \(I\) is flowing and let \(V\) be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor. Then Ohm's law states that

\[V\propto I\]

or, \(V=R\,I\)

where the constant of proportionality \(R\) is called the _resistance_ of the conductor. The SI units of resistance is \(ohm\), and is denoted by the symbol \(\Omega\). The resistance \(R\) not only depends on the material of the conductor but also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of \(R\) on the dimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.

Consider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of length \(I\) and cross sectional area \(A\) [Fig. 1(a)]. Imagine placing two such identical slabs side by side [Fig. 1(b)], so that the length of the combination is \(2I\). The current flowing through the combination is the same as that flowing through either of the slabs. If \(V\) is the potential difference across the ends of the first slab, then \(V\) is also the potential difference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is

Figure 1: Charges \(+\mathcal{G}\) and \(-\mathcal{G}\) put at the ends of a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift because of the electric field created to neutralise the charges. The current thus will stop after a while unless the charges \(+\mathcal{G}\) and \(-\mathcal{G}\) are continuously replenished.

identical to the first and the same current \(I\) flows through both. The potential difference across the ends of the combination is clearly sum of the potential difference across the two individual slabs and hence equals \(2V\). The current through the combination is \(I\) and the resistance of the combination \(R_{\mathrm{C}}\) is [from Eq. (3.3)].

\[R_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{2V}{I}=2\,R \tag{3.4}\]

since \(V/I=R\), the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus, doubling the length of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to length.

\[R\propto l \tag{3.5}\]

Next, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it lengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a combination of two identical slabs of length \(l\), but each having a cross sectional area of \(A/2\) [Fig. 3.2(c)].

For a given voltage \(V\)across the slab, if \(I\)is the current through the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing through each of the two half-slabs is \(I/2\). Since the potential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is \(V\), i.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each of the half-slabs \(R_{\mathrm{i}}\) is

\[R_{\mathrm{i}}=\frac{V}{(I/2)}=2\,\frac{V}{I}=2R. \tag{3.6}\]

Thus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then the resistance \(R\)is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area,

\[R\propto\frac{1}{A} \tag{3.7}\]

Combining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have

\[R\propto\frac{l}{A} \tag{3.8}\]

and hence for a given conductor

\[R=\rho\,\frac{l}{A} \tag{3.9}\]

where the constant of proportionality \(\rho\) depends on the material of the conductor but not on its dimensions. \(\rho\) is called _resistivity_.

Using the last equation, Ohm's law reads

\[V=I\times R=\frac{I\rho l}{A} \tag{3.10}\]

Current per unit area (taken normal to the current), \(I/A\), is called _current density_ and is denoted by \(j\). The SI units of the current density are A/m\({}^{2}\). Further, if \(E\) is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the conductor whose length is \(l\), then the potential difference \(V\)across its ends is \(El\). Using these, the last equation reads\[E\,l=j\,\rho\,l\] or, \[E=j\,\rho \tag{3.11}\]

The above relation for _magnitudes_\(E\) and \(j\) can indeed be cast in a _vector_ form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current through unit area _normal_ to the current) is also directed along \(\mathbf{E}\), and is also a vector \(\mathbf{j}\) (=\(j\,\mathbf{E}/E\)). Thus, the last equation can be written as,

\[\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{j}\rho \tag{3.12}\]

or, \[\mathbf{j}=\sigma\,\mathbf{E}\] (3.13)

where \(\sigma=1/\rho\) is called the _conductivity_. Ohm's law is often stated in an equivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we will try to understand the origin of the Ohm's law as arising from the characteristics of the drift of electrons.

### 3.5 Drift of Electrons and the Origin of Resistivity

As remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random directions. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be zero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are \(N\) electrons and the velocity of the \(i^{\mathrm{th}}\) electron (\(i=1,\,2,\,3,\,...\,\,\mathrm{N}\)) at a given time is \(\mathbf{v}_{i}\), then

\[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0 \tag{3.14}\]

Consider now the situation when an electric field is present. Electrons will be accelerated due to this field by

\[\mathbf{a}=\frac{-e\,E}{m} \tag{3.15}\]

where \(-e\) is the charge and \(m\) is the mass of an electron. Consider again the \(i^{\mathrm{th}}\) electron at a given time \(t\). This electron would have had its last collision some time before \(t\), and let \(t_{i}\) be the time elapsed after its last collision. If \(\mathbf{v}_{i}\) was its velocity immediately after the last collision, then its velocity \(\mathbf{V}_{i}\) at time \(t\) is

\[\mathbf{V}_{i}=\mathbf{v}_{i}-\frac{e\,E}{m}\,t_{i} \tag{3.16}\]

since starting with its last collision it was accelerated (Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a time interval \(t_{i}\). The average velocity of the electrons at time \(t\) is the average of all the \(\mathbf{V}_{i}\)'s. The average of \(\mathbf{v}_{i}\)'s is zero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision, the direction of the velocity of an electron is completely random. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at regular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by \(\tau\), the average time between successive collsions. Then at a given time, some of the electrons would have spent

Figure 3.3: A schematic picture of an electron moving from a point A to another point B through repeated collisions, and straight line travel between collisions (full lines). If an electric field is applied as shown, the electron ends up at point B’ (dotted lines). A slight drift in a direction opposite the electric field is visible.

time more than \(\tau\) and some less than \(\tau\). In other words, the time \(t_{t}\) in Eq. (3.16) will be less than \(\tau\) for some and more than \(\tau\) for others as we go through the values of \(i=1\), \(2\)..... N. The average value of \(t_{t}\) then is \(\tau\) (known as _relaxation time_). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the \(N\)-electrons at any given time \(t\) gives us for the average velocity \(\textbf{v}_{d}\)

\[=0-\frac{e\textbf{E}}{m}\tau=-\frac{e\textbf{E}}{m}\tau \tag{3.17}\]

This last result is surprising. It tells us that the electrons move with an average velocity which is independent of time, although electrons are accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the velocity \(\textbf{v}_{d}\) in Eq. (3.17) is called the _drift velocity_.

Because of the drift, there will be net transport of charges across any area perpendicular to **E**. Consider a planar area \(A\), located inside the conductor such that the normal to the area is parallel to **E** (Fig. 3.4). Then because of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time \(\Delta t\), all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto \(|\textbf{v}_{d}|\Delta t\) would have crossed the area. If \(n\) is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are \(n\,\Delta t\)\(|\textbf{v}_{d}|A\) such electrons. Since each electron carries a charge \(-e\), the total charge transported across this area \(A\) to the right in time \(\Delta t\)is \(-ne\,A\)\(|\textbf{v}_{d}|\Delta t\). **E** is directed towards the left and hence the total charge transported along **E** across the area is negative of this. The amount of charge crossing the area \(A\) in time \(\Delta t\) is by definition [Eq. (3.2)] \(I\,\Delta t\), where \(I\) is the magnitude of the current. Hence,

\[\dot{I}\Delta t=+ne\,A\,|\textbf{v}_{d}|\Delta t \tag{3.18}\]

Substituting the value of \(|\textbf{v}_{d}|\) from Eq. (3.17)

\[I\,\Delta t=\frac{e^{2}A}{m}\tau n\,\Delta t|\textbf{E}| \tag{3.19}\]

By definition \(I\) is related to the magnitude \(|\textbf{J}|\) of the current density by

\[I=|\textbf{J}|A \tag{3.20}\]

Hence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),

\[|\textbf{J}|=\frac{ne^{2}}{m}\tau|\textbf{E}| \tag{3.21}\]

The vector **j** is parallel to **E** and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in the vector form

\[\dot{\textbf{J}}=\frac{ne^{2}}{m}\tau\textbf{E} \tag{3.22}\]

Comparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm's law, if we identify the conductivity \(\sigma\) as

Figure 3.4: Current in a metallic conductor. The magnitude of current density in a metal is the magnitude of charge contained in a cylinder of unit area and length \(v_{d}\).

\[\sigma=\frac{ne^{2}}{m}\tau \tag{3.23}\]

We thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction reproduces Ohm's law. We have, of course, made assumptions that \(\tau\) and \(n\) are constants, independent of \(E\). We shall, in the next section, discuss the limitations of Ohm's law.

**Example 3.1** (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area \(1.0\times 10^{-7}\) m\({}^{2}\)carrying a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly one conduction electron. The density of copper is \(9.0\times 10^{3}\) kg/m\({}^{3}\), and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained above with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary temperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the conductor which causes the drift motion.

**Solution**

(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction of increasing potential. The drift speed \(v_{d}\) is given by Eq. (3.18) \(v_{d}=\left(l/neA\right)\)

Now, \(e=1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C, \(A=1.0\times 10^{-7}\)m\({}^{2}\), \(I=1.5\) A. The density of conduction electrons, \(n\) is equal to the number of atoms per cubic metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre of copper has a mass of \(9.0\times 10^{3}\) kg. Since \(6.0\times 10^{23}\) copper atoms have a mass of 63.5 g.

\[n=\frac{6.0\times 10^{23}}{63.5}\times 9.0\times 10^{6}\]

\[=8.5\times 10^{28}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}\]

which gives,

\[v_{d}=\frac{1.5}{8.5\times 10^{28}\times 1.6\times 10^{-19}\times 1.0\times 1 0^{-7}}\]

\[=1.1\times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,=1.1\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s} ^{-1}\]

(i) At a temperature \(T\), the thermal speed* of a copper atom of mass \(M\) is obtained from [\(<\)(1/2) Mu\({}^{2}\) > = (3/2) \(k_{\mathrm{B}}T\)] and is thus typically of the order of \(\sqrt{k_{\mathrm{B}}T/M}\), where \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{2}\) m/s. This figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much smaller, about 10\({}^{-5}\) times the typical thermal speed at ordinary temperatures.

(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to \(3.0\times 10^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\) (You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in comparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10\({}^{-11}\).

**Example 3.2**:
1. In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a few mm s\({}^{-1}\) for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then is current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?
2. The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons in the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause acceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average drift speed?
3. If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron's charge is small, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a conductor?
4. When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential, does it mean that all the 'free' electrons of the metal are moving in the same direction?
5. Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of electric field, (ii) presence of electric field? Solution
6. Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly (with the speed of light) causing at every point a _local electron drift_. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons from one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However, it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.
7. Each 'free' electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until it collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed after collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed again only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average, therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.
8. Simple, because the electron number density is enormous, \(\sim\)10\({}^{29}\) m\({}^{-3}\).
9. By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large random velocities of electrons.
10. In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines: in the presence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.

#### 3.5.1 Mobility

As we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be both positive and negative ions.

An important quantity is the _mobility_\(\mu\) defined as the magnitude of the drift velocity per unit electric field:

\[\mu\!=\!\frac{\left|\textbf{v}_{d}\right|}{E} \tag{3.24}\]

The SI unit of mobility is m\({}^{2}\)/Vs and is 10\({}^{4}\) of the mobility in practical units (cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs). Mobility is positve. From Eq. (3.17), we have

\[v_{d}=\frac{\dot{e}\ \tau\ E}{m}\]Hence,

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{\mu}}=\frac{v_{a}}{E}=\frac{e\,\tau}{m} \tag{3.25}\]

where \(\tau\) is the average collision time for electrons.

### 3.6 Limitations of Ohm's Law

Although Ohm's law has been found valid over a large class of materials, there do exist materials and devices used in electric circuits where the proportionality of \(V\) and \(I\) does not hold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following types:

1. \(V\) ceases to be proportional to \(I\) (Fig. 3.5).
2. The relation between \(V\) and \(I\) depends on the sign of \(V\). In other words, if \(I\) is the current for a certain \(V\), then reversing the direction of \(V\) keeping its magnitude fixed, does not produce a current of the same magnitude as \(I\) in the opposite direction (Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study in Chapter 14.
3. The relation between \(V\) and \(I\) is not unique, i.e., there is more than one value of \(V\) for the same current \(I\) (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting such behaviour is GaAs. Materials and devices not obeying Ohm's law in the form of Eq. (3.3) are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in materials that obey Ohm's law.

### 3.7 Resistivity of Various Materials

The resistivities of various common materials are listed in Table 3.1. The materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators

Figure 3.6: Characteristic curve of a diode. Note the different scales for negative and positive values of the voltage and current.

Figure 3.5: The dashed line represents the linear Ohm’s law. The solid line is the voltage \(V\) versus current \(I\) for a good conductor.

depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values. Metals have low resistivities in the range of \(10^{-8}\,\Omega\)m to \(10^{-6}\,\Omega\)m. At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having resistivities \(10^{18}\) times greater than metals or more. In between the two are the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities of semiconductors are also affected by presence of small amount of impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for electronic devices.

Commercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories are of two major types: _wire bound resistors_ and _carbon resistors_. Wire bound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz., manganin, constantan, nichrome or similar ones. The choice of these materials is dictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive to temperature. These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction of an ohm to a few hundred ohms.

Resistors in the higher range are made mostly from carbon. Carbon resistors are compact, inexpensive and thus find extensive use in electronic circuits. Carbon resistors are small in size and hence their values are given using a colour code.

The resistors have a set of co-axial coloured rings on them whose significance are listed in Table 3.2. The first two _bands_ from the end indicate the first two significant figures of the resistance in ohms. The third band indicates the decimal multiplier (as listed in Table 3.2). The last band stands for tolerance or possible variation in percentage about the indicated values. Sometimes, this last band is absent and that indicates a tolerance of 20% (Fig. 3.8). For example, if the four colours are orange, blue, yellow and gold, the resistance value is \(36\times 10^{4}\,\Omega\), with a tolerance value of 5%.

### Temperature Dependence of Resistivity

The resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistvity of a metallic conductor is approximately given by,

\[\rho_{\mathrm{r}}=\rho_{0}\left[1+\alpha\left(T\!\!-\!T_{0}\right)\right] \tag{3.26}\]

where \(\rho_{\mathrm{r}}\) is the resistivity at a temperature \(T\) and \(\rho_{0}\) is the same at a reference temperature \(T_{0}\). \(\alpha\) is called the _temperature co-efficient_ of _resistivity_, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of \(\alpha\) is (Temperature)[1].

For metals, \(\alpha\)is positive and values of \(\alpha\) for some metals at \(T_{0}=0^{\circ}\)C are listed in Table 1.

The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of \(\rho_{\tau}\) plotted against \(T\) would be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than \(0^{\circ}\)C, the graph, however, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 9).

Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range of \(T\) around any reference temperature \(T_{0}\), where the graph can be approximated as a straight line.

Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and chromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature (Fig. 10). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since their resistance values would change very little with temperatures.

Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 11.

We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation, resistivity of a material is given by

\[\rho=\frac{1}{\sigma}=\frac{m}{n\,e^{2}\tau} \tag{3.27}\]

\(\rho\) thus depends inversely both on the number \(n\) of free electrons per unit volume and on the average time \(\tau\) between collisions. As we increase temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time of collisions \(\tau\), thus decreases with temperature.

In a metal, \(n\) is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of \(\tau\) with rise in temperature causes \(\rho\) to increase as we have observed.

For insulators and semiconductors, however, \(n\) increases with temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in \(\tau\) in Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, \(\rho\) decreases with temperature.

**Example 3.3**: An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating element. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its resistance at room temperature (27.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is found to be 75.3 \(\Omega\). When the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range involved, is 1.70 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\)\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}^{-1}\).

**Solution**: When the current through the element is very small, heating effects can be ignored and the temperature \(T_{{}_{1}}\) of the element is the same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The resistance \(R_{{}_{2}}\) at the steady temperature \(T_{{}_{2}}\) is

\[R_{{}_{2}}=\frac{230\,\mathrm{V}}{2.68\,\mathrm{A}}=85.8\ \Omega\]

Using the relation

\[R_{{}_{2}}=R_{{}_{1}}\left[1+\alpha\left(T_{{}_{2}}-T_{{}_{1}}\right)\right]\]

with \(\alpha=1.70\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\)\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}^{-1}\), we get

\[T_{{}_{2}}-T_{{}_{1}}=\frac{\left(85.8-75.3\right)}{\left(75.3\right)\times 1.70\times 10^{-4}}=820\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\]

that is, \(T_{{}_{2}}=\left(820+27.0\right)\)\({}^{\circ}\)C = 847\({}^{\circ}\)C

Thus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating effect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is 847 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

**Example 3.4**: The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum resistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 \(\Omega\) and at steam point is 5.23 \(\Omega\). When the thermometer is inserted in a hot bath, the resistance of the platinum wire is 5.795 \(\Omega\). Calculate the temperature of the bath.

**Solution \(R_{{}_{0}}=5\ \Omega\), \(R_{{}_{100}}=5.23\ \Omega\) and \(R_{{}_{1}}=5.795\ \Omega\)**

Now, \(t=\frac{R_{{}_{1}}-R_{{}_{00}}}{R_{{}_{00}}-R_{{}_{0}}}\times 100\), \(R_{{}_{0}}=R_{{}_{0}}\left(1+\alpha t\right)\)

\(=\frac{5.795-5}{5.23-5}\times 100\)

\(=\frac{0.795}{0.23}\times 100=345.65\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)

### Electrical Energy, Power

Consider a conductor with end points A and B, in which a current \(I\) is flowing from A to B. The electric potential at A and B are denoted by \(V\)(A)and \(V\)(B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, \(V\)(A) \(>V\)(B) and the potential difference across AB is \(V\)= \(V\)(A) - \(V\)(B) \(>0\).

In a time interval \(\Delta t\), an amount of charge \(\Delta\)\(\mathcal{Q}\)= \(I\)\(\Delta t\) travels from A to B. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was \(\mathcal{Q}\)\(V\)(A) and similarly at B, it is \(\mathcal{Q}\)\(V\)(B). Thus, change in its potential energy \(\Delta U_{\mathrm{pot}}\) is \(\Delta U_{\mathrm{pot}}\) = Final potential energy - Initial potential energy

\[=\Delta\mathcal{Q}\)(\(V\)(B) - \(V\)(A)] = -\(\Delta\)\(\mathcal{Q}\)\(V\)

If charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their kinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged. Conservation of total energy would then imply that,

\[\Delta\mathcal{K}=\ -\Delta U_{\mathrm{pot}} \tag{3.29}\]

that is,

\[\Delta\mathcal{K}=I\)\(V\Delta t>0 \tag{3.30}\]

Thus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under the action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they move. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers do not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is because of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During collisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms. The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus, in an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the conductor during the time interval \(\Delta t\) is,

\[\Delta\mathcal{W}=I\)\(V\Delta t \tag{3.31}\]

The energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated \(P=\Delta W/\Delta t\) and we have,

\[P=I\)\(V \tag{3.32}\]

Using Ohm's law \(V\)= \(IR\), we get

\[P=I^{2}\)\(R=V^{2}/R \tag{3.33}\]

as the power loss ("ohmic loss") in a conductor of resistance \(R\) carrying a current \(I\). It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an electric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.

Where does the power come from? As we have reasoned before, we need an external source to keep a steady current through the conductor. It is clearly this source which must supply this power. In the simple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.12), it is the chemical energy of the cell which supplies this power for as long as it can.

The expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33), show the dependence of the power dissipated in a resistor \(R\) on the current through it and the voltage across it.

Equation (3.33) has an important application to power transmission. Electrical power is transmitted from power stations to homes and factories, which

Figure 3.12: Heat is produced in the resistor \(R\) which is connected across the terminals of a cell. The energy dissipated in the resistor \(R\) comes from the chemical energy of the electrolyte.

may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously wants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes and factories. We shall see now how this can be achieved. Consider a device \(R\), to which a power \(P\)is to be delivered via transmission cables having a resistance \(R_{\mathrm{c}}\) to be dissipated by it finally. If \(V\)is the voltage across \(R\) and \(I\) the current through it, then

\[P=V\,I \tag{3.34}\]

The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite resistance \(R_{\mathrm{c}}\). The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is wasted is \(P_{\mathrm{c}}\) with

\[P_{\mathrm{c}}=I^{2}\,R_{\mathrm{c}}\] \[=\frac{P^{2}\,R_{\mathrm{c}}}{V^{2}} \tag{3.35}\]

from Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power \(P\), the power wasted in the connecting wires is inversely proportional to \(V^{2}\). The transmission cables from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance \(R_{\mathrm{c}}\) is considerable. To reduce \(P_{\mathrm{c}}\) these wires carry current at enormous values of \(V\)and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission lines -- a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.

### Combination of Resistors - Series and Parallel

The current through a single resistor \(R\) across which there is a potential difference \(V\)is given by Ohm's law \(I=V/R\). Resistors are sometimes joined together and there are simple rules for calculation of equivalent resistance of such combination.

Two resistors are said to be in _series_ if only one of their end points is joined (Fig. 3.13). If a third resistor is joined with the series combination of the two (Fig. 3.14), then all three are said to be in series. Clearly, we can extend this definition to series combination of any number of resistors.

Two or more resistors are said to be in _parallel_ if one end of all the resistors is joined together and similarly the other ends joined together (Fig. 3.15).

Figure 3.14: A series combination of three resistors \(R_{\mathrm{1}}\), \(R_{\mathrm{2}}\), \(R_{\mathrm{3}}\).

Figure 3.15: Two resistors \(R_{\mathrm{1}}\) and \(R_{\mathrm{2}}\) connected in parallel.

Consider two resistors \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) in series. The charge which leaves \(R_{1}\) must be entering \(R_{2}\). Since current measures the rate of flow of charge, this means that the same current \(I\) flows through \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\). By Ohm's law:

Potential difference across \(R_{1}=V_{1}=I\,R_{1}\), and

Potential difference across \(R_{2}=V_{2}=I\,R_{2}\).

The potential difference \(V\) across the combination is \(V_{1}+V_{2}\). Hence,

\[V=V_{1}+V_{2}=I\,(R_{1}+R_{2}) \tag{3.36}\]

This is as if the combination had an equivalent resistance \(R_{eq}\) which by Ohm's law is

\[R_{eq}=\frac{V}{I}=(R_{1}+R_{2}) \tag{3.37}\]

If we had three resistors connected in series, then similarly

\[V=I\,R_{1}+I\,R_{2}+I\,R_{3}=I\,(R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}). \tag{3.38}\]

This obviously can be extended to a series combination of any number n of resistors \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\)....., \(R_{n}\). The equivalent resistance \(R_{eq}\) is

\[R_{eq}=R_{1}+R_{2}+\ldots+R_{n} \tag{3.39}\]

Consider now the parallel combination of two resistors (Fig. 3.15). The charge that flows in at \(A\) from the left flows out partly through \(R_{1}\) and partly through \(R_{2}\). The currents \(I\), \(I_{1}\), \(I_{2}\) shown in the figure are the rates of flow of charge at the points indicated. Hence,

\[I=I_{1}+I_{2} \tag{3.40}\]

The potential difference between \(A\) and \(B\) is given by the Ohm's law applied to \(R_{1}\)

\[V=I_{1},R_{1} \tag{3.41}\]

Also, Ohm's law applied to \(R_{2}\) gives

\[V=I_{2}\,R_{2} \tag{3.42}\]

\[\therefore I=I_{1}+I_{2}=\frac{V}{R_{1}}+\frac{V}{R_{2}}=V\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+ \frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) \tag{3.43}\]

If the combination was replaced by an equivalent resistance \(R_{eq}\), we would have, by Ohm's law

\[I=\frac{V}{R_{eq}} \tag{3.44}\]

Hence,

\[\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}} \tag{3.45}\]

We can easily see how this extends to three resistors in parallel (Fig. 3.16).

Figure 3.16: Parallel combination of three resistors \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\) and \(R_{3}\).

Exactly as before

\[I=I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3} \tag{3.46}\]

and applying Ohm's law to \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\) and \(R_{3}\) we get,

\[V=I_{1}\ R_{1}\ V=I_{2}\ R_{2}\ V=I_{3}\ R_{3} \tag{3.47}\]

So that

\[I=I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}=V\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}\right) \tag{3.48}\]

An equivalent resistance \(R_{eq}\) that replaces the combination, would be such that

\[I=\frac{V}{R_{eq}} \tag{3.49}\]

and hence

\[\frac{\cdot}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}} \tag{3.50}\]

We can reason similarly for any number of resistors in parallel. The equivalent resistance of \(n\) resistors \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\ldots R_{n}\) is

\[\frac{\cdot}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\ldots+\frac{1}{R_{n}} \tag{3.51}\]

These formulae for equivalent resistances can be used to find out currents and voltages in more complicated circuits. Consider for example, the circuit in Fig. (3.17), where there are three resistors \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\) and \(R_{3}\). \(R_{2}\) and \(R_{3}\) are in parallel and hence we can replace them by an equivalent \(R_{eq}^{23}\) between point B and C with

\[\frac{1}{R_{eq}^{23}}=\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}} \tag{3.52}\] \[\text{or, }\ R_{eq}^{23}=\frac{R_{2}R_{3}}{R_{2}+R_{3}} \tag{3.53}\]

The circuit now has \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{eq}^{23}\) in series and hence their combination can be replaced by an equivalent resistance \(R_{eq}^{123}\) with

\[R_{eq}^{123}=R_{eq}^{23}+R_{1} \tag{3.54}\]

If the voltage between A and C is \(V\), the current \(I\) is given by

\[\begin{split}\cdot& I=\frac{V}{R_{eq}^{23}}=\frac{V} {R_{1}+\left[R_{2}R_{3}\left/\left(R_{2}+R_{3}\right)\right]\right.}\\ &\cdot\\ &=\frac{V\left(R_{2}+R_{3}\right)}{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{1}R_{3}+R_{2}R_ {3}}\end{split} \tag{3.55}\]

### 3.11 Cells, emf, Internal Resistance

We have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady current in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has two electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in Fig. 3.18. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in the solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The positive electrode has a potential difference \(V_{*}\) (\(V_{*}>0\)) between itself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked A in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative potential \(-\) (\(V_{*}\)) (\(V_{*}\geq 0\)) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it, marked as \(B\) in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte has the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference between P and N is \(V_{*}-\) (\(-V_{*}\)) = \(V_{*}+V_{*}\). This difference is called the _electromotive force_ (emf) of the cell and is denoted by \(\varepsilon\). Thus

\[\varepsilon=V_{*}+V_{*}>0 \tag{3.55}\]

Note that \(\varepsilon\) is, actually, a potential difference and _not a force_. The name emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was given at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.

To understand the significance of \(\varepsilon\), consider a resistor \(R\) connected across the cell (Fig. 3.18). A current \(I\) flows across \(R\) from C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained because current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly, across the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte but from N to P, whereas through \(R\), it flows from P to N.

The electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite resistance \(r\), called the _internal resistance_. Consider first the situation when \(R\) is infinite so that \(I=V/R=0\), where \(V\) is the potential difference between P and N. Now,

\[\begin{array}{l}V=\text{Potential difference between P and A}\\ \text{+ Potential difference between A and B}\\ \text{+ Potential difference between B and N}\\ =\varepsilon\end{array} \tag{3.56}\]

Thus, emf \(\varepsilon\) is the potential difference between the positive and negative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is flowing through the cell.

If however \(R\) is finite, \(I\) is not zero. In that case the potential difference between P and N is

\[\begin{array}{l}V=V_{*}+V_{*}-I\ r\\ =\varepsilon-I\ r\end{array} \tag{3.57}\]

Note the negative sign in the expression (\(I\ r\)) for the potential difference between A and B. This is because the current \(I\) flows from B to A in the electrolyte.

In practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit may be neglected when the current \(I\) is such that \(\varepsilon>>I\ r\). The actual values of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal resistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common electrolytic cells.

Figure 3.18: (a) Sketch of an electrolyte cell with positive terminal P and negative terminal N. The gap between the electrodes is exaggerated for clarity. A and B are points in the electrolyte typically close to P and N. (b) the symbol for a cell, \(+\) referring to P and - referring to the N electrode. Electrical connections to the cell are made at P and N.

We also observe that since \(V\) is the potential difference across \(R\), we have from Ohm's law

\[V=I\ R \tag{3.58}\]

Combining Eqs. (3.57) and (3.58), we get

\[I\ R\ =\ \varepsilon-I\ r \tag{3.59}\]

Or, \(I=\frac{\varepsilon}{R+r}\)

The maximum current that can be drawn from a cell is for \(R=0\) and it is \(I_{\max}=\varepsilon/r\). However, in most cells the maximum allowed current is much lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.

In olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric flash of supernatural origin. It was believed to be the great weapon of Gods. But today the phenomenon of lightning can be explained scientifically by elementary principles of physics.

Atmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges. In the ionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar-terrestrial interaction. In the lower atmosphere the current is weaker and is maintained by thunderstorm.

There are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart. The smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge. These charged particles get separated by updrafts in the clouds and gravity. The upper portion of the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to dipole structure. Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the cloud. The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development. Also cosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and air becomes (weakly) electrically conductive. The separation of charges produce tremendous amount of electrical potential within the cloud as well as between the cloud and ground. This can amount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air breaks down and lightning flash begins and thousands of amperes of current flows. The electric field is of the order of \(10^{5}\) V/m. A lightning flash is composed of a series of strokes with an average of about four and the duration of each flash is about 30 seconds. The average peak power per stroke is about \(10^{12}\) watts.

During fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere. The fair weather electric field arises due to the existence of a surface charge density at ground and an atmospheric conductivity as well as due to the flow of current from the ionosphere to the earth's surface, which is of the order of picoampere / square metre. The surface charge density at ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward. Over land the average electric field is about 120 V/m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of \(-1.2\times 10^{-9}\) C/m\({}^{2}\). Over the entire earth's surface, the total negative charge amount to about 600 kC. An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere. This electric field is not noticeable in daily life. The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including our bodies, is conductor compared to air.

**Example 3.5** A network of resistors is connected to a 16 V battery with internal resistance of \(1\Omega\), as shown in Fig. 3.19: (a) Compute the equivalent resistance of the network. (b) Obtain the current in each resistor. (c) Obtain the voltage drops \(V_{AB}\), \(V_{\mathrm{LC}}\) and \(V_{\mathrm{C}\prime}\).

**Solution**

(a) The network is a simple series and parallel combination of resistors. First the two \(4\Omega\) resistors in parallel are equivalent to a resistor = [(4 x 4)/(4 + 4)] \(\Omega\) = 2 \(\Omega\).

In the same way, the 12 \(\Omega\) and 6 \(\Omega\) resistors in parallel are equivalent to a resistor of

[(12 x 6)/(12 + 6)] \(\Omega\) = 4 \(\Omega\).

The equivalent resistance \(R\) of the network is obtained by combining these resistors (2 \(\Omega\) and 4 \(\Omega\)) with 1 \(\Omega\) in series, that is,

\(R\) = 2 \(\Omega\) + 4 \(\Omega\) + 1 \(\Omega\) = 7 \(\Omega\).

(b) The total current \(I\) in the circuit is

\[I\) = \(\frac{e}{R+r}\) = \(\frac{16V}{(7+1)\Omega}\) = 2 A

Consider the resistors between A and B. If \(I_{\mathrm{I}}\) is the current in one of the 4 \(\Omega\) resistors and \(I_{\mathrm{2}}\) the current in the other,

\(I_{\mathrm{3}}\times 4\) = \(I_{\mathrm{3}}\times 4\)

that is, \(I_{\mathrm{1}}\) = \(I_{\mathrm{2}}\), which is otherwise obvious from the symmetry of the two arms. But \(I_{\mathrm{1}}\) + \(I_{\mathrm{2}}\) = \(I\) = 2 A. Thus,

\(I_{\mathrm{1}}\) = \(I_{\mathrm{2}}\) = 1 A

that is, current in each 4 \(\Omega\) resistor is 1 A. Current in 1 \(\Omega\) resistor between B and C would be 2 A.

Now, consider the resistances between C and D. If \(I_{\mathrm{3}}\) is the current in the 12 \(\Omega\) resistor, and \(I_{\mathrm{4}}\) in the 6 \(\Omega\) resistor,

\(I_{\mathrm{3}}\times 12\) = \(I_{\mathrm{4}}\times 6\), i.e. \(I_{\mathrm{4}}\) = \(2I_{\mathrm{3}}\)

But, \(I_{\mathrm{3}}\) + \(I_{\mathrm{4}}\) = \(I\) = 2 A

Thus, \(I_{\mathrm{3}}\) = \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\) A, \(I_{\mathrm{4}}\) = \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)\) A

that is, the current in the 12 \(\Omega\) resistor is (2/3) A, while the current in the 6 \(\Omega\) resistor is (4/3) A.

(c) The voltage drop across AB is

\(V_{AB}\) = \(I_{\mathrm{1}}\times 4\) = 1 A x 4 \(\Omega\) = 4 V,

This can also be obtained by multiplying the total current between A and B by the equivalent resistance between A and B, that is,\(V_{\text{AD}}=2\) A x 2 \(\Omega=4\) V The voltage drop across BC is \(V_{\text{BC}}=2\) A x 1 \(\Omega=2\) V Finally, the voltage drop across CD is \(V_{\text{CD}}=12\)\(\Omega\times I_{\text{J}}=12\)\(\Omega\times\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\) A = 8 V. This can alternately be obtained by multiplying total current between C and D by the equivalent resistance between C and D, that is, \(V_{\text{CD}}=2\) A x 4 \(\Omega=8\) V Note that the total voltage drop across AD is 4 V + 2 V + 8 V = 14 V. Thus, the terminal voltage of the battery is 14 V, while its emf is 16 V. The loss of the voltage (= 2 V) is accounted for by the internal resistance 1 \(\Omega\) of the battery [2 A x 1 \(\Omega=2\) V].

### 3.12 Cells in Series and in Parallel

Like resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit, replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.

Consider first two cells in series (Fig. 3.20), where one terminal of the two cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free. \(\varepsilon_{1}\), \(\varepsilon_{2}\) are the emf's of the two cells and \(r_{1}\), \(r_{2}\) their internal resistances, respectively.

Let \(V\)(A), \(V\)(B), \(V\)(C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in Fig. 3.20. Then \(V\)(A) - \(V\)(B) is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in Eq. (3.57) and hence,

\[V_{\text{AD}}=V\text{(A)}-V\text{(B)}=\varepsilon_{1}-I\tau_{1} \tag{3.60}\]

Similarly,

\[V_{\text{BC}}=V\text{(B)}-V\text{(C)}=\varepsilon_{2}-I\tau_{2} \tag{3.61}\]

Hence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of the combination is

\[V_{\text{AC}} =V\text{(A)}-V\text{(C)}=\left[V\text{(A)}-V\text{(B)}\right]+ \left[V\text{(B)}-V\text{(C)}\right]\] \[=\left(\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}\right)-I\left(\tau_{1}+r_ {2}\right) \tag{3.62}\]

Figure 3.20: Two cells of emf’s \(\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(\varepsilon_{2}\) in the series. \(r_{1}\), \(r_{2}\) are their internal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combination can be considered as one cell of emf \(\varepsilon_{\text{eq}}\) and an internal resistance \(r_{\text{eq}}\).

If we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and C of emf \(\varepsilon_{eq}\) and internal resistance \(r_{eq}\) we would have

\[V_{AC}=\varepsilon_{eq}-I\,r_{eq} \tag{3.63}\]

Comparing the last two equations, we get

\[\varepsilon_{eq}=\varepsilon_{1}+\varepsilon_{2} \tag{3.64}\]

and \(r_{eq}=r_{1}+r_{2}\)

In Fig.3.20, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the positive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives, Eq. (3.61) would change to \(V_{BC}=-\varepsilon_{2}-I\,r_{2}\) and we will get

\[\varepsilon_{eq}=\varepsilon_{1}-\varepsilon_{2}\qquad\{\varepsilon_{1}> \varepsilon_{2}\} \tag{3.66}\]

The rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number of cells:

1. The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their individual emf's, and
2. The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their internal resistances.

This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive electrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from the _negative_ electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression for \(\varepsilon_{eq}\) with a _negative_ sign, as in Eq. (3.66).

Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.21). \(I_{1}\) and \(I_{2}\) are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the cells. At the point B\({}_{1}\), \(I_{1}\) and \(I_{2}\) flow in whereas the current \(I\) flows out. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have

\[I=I_{1}+I_{2} \tag{3.67}\]

Let \(V(B_{1})\) and \(V(B_{2})\) be the potentials at \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\), respectively. Then, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its terminals is \(V(B_{1})-V(B_{2})\). Hence, from Eq. (3.57)

\[V=V\,(B_{1})-V\,(B_{2})=\varepsilon_{1}-I_{1}r_{1} \tag{3.68}\]

Points \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) are connected exactly similarly to the second cell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have

\[V=V\,(B_{1})-V\,(B_{2})=\varepsilon_{2}-I_{2}r_{2} \tag{3.69}\]

Combining the last three equations

\[\begin{array}{l}\dot{I}\ =\ I_{1}\ +\ I_{2}\\The last two equations should be the same and hence \(\cdot\).

\[\varepsilon_{eq}=\frac{\varepsilon_{1}r_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}r_{1}}{r_{1}+r_{2}} \tag{3.73}\]

\[r_{eq}=\frac{r_{1}r_{2}}{r_{1}+r_{2}} \tag{3.74}\]

We can put these equations in a simpler way,

\[\frac{1}{r_{eq}}=\frac{1}{r_{1}}+\frac{1}{r_{2}} \tag{3.75}\]

\[\frac{\varepsilon_{eq}}{r_{eq}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{1}}{r_{1}}+\frac{ \varepsilon_{2}}{r_{2}} \tag{3.76}\]

In Fig. (3.21), we had joined the positive terminals together and similarly the two negative ones, so that the currents \(I_{1}\), \(I_{2}\) now out of positive terminals. If the negative terminal of the second is connected to positive terminal of the first, Eqs. (3.75) and (3.76) would still be valid with \(\varepsilon_{2}\rightarrow-\varepsilon_{2}\).

Equations (3.75) and (3.76) can be extended easily. If there an n cells of emf \(\varepsilon_{1},\ldots\varepsilon_{n}\) and of internal resistances \(r_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(r_{n}\) respectively, connected in parallel, the combination is equivalent to a single cell of emf \(\varepsilon_{eq}\) and internal resistance \(r_{eq}\), such that

\[\frac{1}{r_{eq}}=\frac{1}{r_{1}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{r_{n}} \tag{3.77}\]

\[\frac{\dot{\varepsilon}_{eq}}{r_{eq}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{1}}{r_{1}}+\cdots+ \frac{\varepsilon_{n}}{r_{n}} \tag{3.78}\]

### Kirchhoff's Rules

Electric circuits generally consist of a number of resistors and cells interconnected sometimes in a complicated way. The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called _Kirchhoff's rules_, are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.

Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a symbol, say \(I\), and a directed arrow to indicate that a current \(I\) flows along the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately \(I\) is determined to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the arrow. If \(I\) turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction opposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other source of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled as well as a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through the cell. This will tell us the potential difference, \(V=V(P)-V(N)=e-Ir\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:523]

**Solution** The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel combinations of resistors. There is, however, a clear symmetry in the problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of the network.

The paths AA', AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say. \(I\). Further, at the corners A', B and D, the incoming current \(I\) must split equally into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of \(I\), using Kirchhoff's first rule and the symmetry in the problem.

Next take a closed loop, say, ABCCEA, and apply Kirchhoff's second rule:

\(-\)\(IR-(1/2)\)\(IR-IR+\varepsilon=0\)

where \(R\) is the resistance of each edge and \(\varepsilon\) the emf of battery. Thus,

\(\varepsilon\)\(=\dfrac{5}{2}IR\)

The equivalent resistance \(R_{\alpha}\) of the network is

\(R_{\alpha}=\dfrac{\varepsilon}{3I}=\dfrac{5}{6}R\)

For \(R=1\)\(\Omega\), \(R_{\alpha}=(5/6)\)\(\Omega\) and for \(\varepsilon=10\) V, the total current (= 3\(I\)) in the network is

\(3I=10\) V/(5/6)\(\Omega=12\) A, i.e., \(I=4\) A

The current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the Fig. 3.23.

It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the great power of Kirchhoff's rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.6. In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff's rules to junctions and closed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.7.

**Example 3.7** Determine the current in each branch of the network shown in Fig. 3.24.

**Solution**: Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current to be determined by the application of Kirchhoff's rules. To reduce the number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch. We then have three unknowns \(I_{1}\), \(I_{2}\) and \(I_{3}\) which can be found by applying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops. Kirchhoff's second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,

\[10-4(I_{1}-I_{2})+2(I_{2}+I_{3}-I_{1})-I_{1}=0\]

that is, \(7I_{1}-6I_{2}-2I_{3}=10\)

For the closed loop ABCA, we get

\[10-4I_{2}-2(I_{2}+I_{3})-I_{1}=0\]

that is, \(I_{1}+6I_{2}+2I_{3}=10\)

For the closed loop BCDEB, we get

\[5-2(I_{2}+I_{3})-2(I_{2}+I_{3}-I_{1})=0\]

that is, \(2I_{1}-4I_{2}-4I_{3}=-5\)

Equations (3.80.a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three unknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give

\[I_{1}=2.5A,\;\;\;I_{2}=\frac{5}{8}\;\;\;A,\;\;I_{3}=1\frac{7}{8}\;\;\;A\]

The currents in the various branches of the network are

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{AB}:\frac{5}{8}\;\;\mbox{A},\;\;\mbox{CA}:2\;\frac{1}{ 2}\;\;\mbox{A},\;\;\;\mbox{DEB}:\frac{1}{8}\;\;\;A\\ \mbox{AD}:1\frac{7}{8}\;\;\mbox{A},\;\;\;\mbox{CD}:0\;\mbox{A},\;\;\mbox{BC}:2 \frac{1}{2}\;\;A\end{array}\]

It is easily verified that Kirchhoff's second rule applied to the remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second rule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage drop over the closed loop BADEB

\[5\,\mbox{V}+\left(\frac{5}{8}\times 4\right)\mbox{V}-\left(\frac{15}{8}\times 4 \right)\mbox{V}\]

equal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff's second rule.

### Wheatstone Bridge

As an application of Kirchhoff's rules consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.25, which is called the _Wheatstone bridge_. The bridge has four resistors \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\), \(R_{3}\) and \(R_{4}\). Across one pair of diagonally opposite points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (_i.e._, AC) is called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This line, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.

For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In general there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a current \(I_{\rm g}\) through G. Of special interest, is the case of a _balanced_ bridge where the resistors are such that \(I_{\rm g}=0\). We can easily get the balance condition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the Kirchhoff's junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)immediately gives us the relations \(I_{1}=I_{2}\) and \(I_{2}=I_{4}\). Next, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first loop gives

\[-I_{1}\,R_{1}+0+I_{2}\,R_{2}=0\qquad\{I_{g}=0\} \tag{3.81}\]

and the second loop gives, upon using \(I_{3}=I_{1}\), \(I_{4}=I_{2}\)

\[I_{2}\,R_{4}+0-I_{1}\,R_{3}=0 \tag{3.82}\]

From Eq. (3.81), we obtain,

\[\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} =\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\]

whereas from Eq. (3.82), we obtain,

\[\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} =\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}}\]

Hence, we obtain the condition

\[\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} =\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}} \tag{3.83}\]

This last equation relating the four resistors is called the _balance condition_ for the galvanometer to give zero or null deflection.

The Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical method for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we have an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; \(R_{4}\) is thus not known. Keeping known resistances \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) in the first and second arm of the bridge, we go on varying \(R_{3}\) till the galvanometer shows a null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance condition the value of the unknown resistance \(R_{4}\) is given by,

\[R_{4}=R_{3}\,\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \tag{3.83}\]

A practical device using this principle is called the _meter bridge_. It will be discussed in the next section.

**Example 3.8**: The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.26) have the following resistances:

\[\text{AB}=100\Omega,\text{ BC}=10\Omega,\text{ CD}=5\Omega,\text{ and DA}=60\Omega.\]A galvanometer of 15\(\Omega\) resistance is connected across BD. Calculate the current through the galvanometer when a potential difference of 10 V is maintained across AC.

**Solution** Considering the mesh BADB, we have

\(100I_{1}+15I_{g}-60I_{2}=0\)

or \(20I_{1}+3I_{g}-12I_{2}=0\)

Considering the mesh BCDB, we have

\(10\)\((I_{1}-I_{g})-15I_{g}-5\)\((I_{2}+I_{g})=0\)

\(10I_{1}-30I_{g}-5I_{2}=0\)

\(2I_{1}-6I_{g}-I_{2}=0\)

Considering the mesh ADCEA,

\(60I_{2}+5I_{2}+I_{g})=10\)

\(65I_{2}+5I_{g}=10\)

\(13I_{2}+I_{g}=2\)

Multiplying Eq. (3.84b) by 10

\(20I_{1}-60I_{g}-10I_{2}=0\)

From Eqs. (3.84d) and (3.84a) we have

\(63I_{g}-2I_{2}=0\)

\(I_{2}=31.5I_{g}\)

Substituting the value of \(I_{2}\) into Eq. (3.84(c)], we get

\(13\)\((31.5I_{g})+I_{g}=2\)

\(410.5I_{g}=2\)

\(I_{g}=4.87\) mA.

### 3.15 Meter Bridge

The meter bridge is shown in Fig. 3.27. It consists of a wire of length 1 m and of uniform cross sectional area stretched taut and clamped between two thick metallic strips bent at right angles, as shown. The metallic strip has two gaps across which resistors can be connected. The end points where the wire is clamped are connected to a cell through a key. One end of a galvanometer is connected to the metallic strip midway between the two gaps. The other end of the galvanometer is connected to a 'jockey'. The jockey is essentially a metallic rod whose one end has a knife-edge which can slide over the wire to make electrical connection.

\(R\) is an unknown resistance whose value we want to determine. It is connected across one of the gaps. Across the other gap, we connect a standard known resistance S. The jockey is connected to some point D on the wire, a distance \(l\) cm from the end A. The jockey can be moved along the wire. The portion AD of the wire has a resistance \(R_{cm}l\), where \(R_{cm}\) is the resistance of the wire per unit centimetre. The portion DC of the wire similarly has a resistance \(R_{cm}\) (100-l).

The four arms AB, BC, DA and CD [with resistances \(R\), S, \(R_{cm}l\) and \(R_{cm}\)(100-l)] obviously form a Wheatstone bridge with AC as the battery arm and BD the galvanometer arm. If the jockey is moved along the wire, then there will be one position where the galvanometer will show no current. Let the distance of the jockey from the end A at the balance point be \(l=l_{1}\). The four resistances of the bridge at the balance point then are \(R\), \(S\), \(R_{cm}l_{1}\) and \(R_{cm}\)(100-l). The balance condition, Eq. [3.83(a)] gives

\[\frac{R}{S}=\frac{R_{cm}l_{1}}{R_{cm}\left(100-l_{1}\right)}=\frac{l_{1}}{100- l_{1}} \tag{3.85}\]

Thus, once we have found out \(l_{1}\), the unknown resistance \(R\) is known in terms of the standard known resistance S by

\[R=S\frac{l_{1}}{100-l_{1}} \tag{3.86}\]

By choosing various values of S, we would get various values of \(l_{1}\), and calculate \(R\) each time. An error in measurement of \(l_{1}\) would naturally result in an error in \(R\). It can be shown that the percentage error in \(R\) can be minimised by adjusting the balance point near the middle of the bridge, i.e., when \(l_{i}\) is close to 50 cm. (This requires a suitable choice of S)

**Example 3.9** In a metre bridge (Fig. 3.27), the null point is found at a distance of 33.7 cm from A. If now a resistance of 12\(\Omega\) is connected in parallel with S, the null point occurs at 51.9 cm. Determine the values of \(R\) and S.

**Solution** From the first balance point, we get

\[\frac{R}{S}=\frac{33.7}{66.3} \tag{3.87}\]

After S is connected in parallel with a resistance of 12\(\Omega\), the resistance across the gap changes from S to \(S_{\omega^{\prime}}\) where

\[S_{\omega^{\prime}}=\frac{12S}{S+12}\]

and hence the new balance condition now gives

\[\frac{51.9}{48.1}=\frac{R}{S_{\omega^{\prime}}}=\frac{R(S+12)}{12\,S} \tag{3.88}\]

Substituting the value of \(R/S\) from Eq. (3.87), we get

\[\frac{51.9}{48.1}=\frac{S+12}{12}\cdot\frac{33.7}{66.3}\]

which gives S = 13.5\(\Omega\). Using the value of \(R/S\) above, we get \(R=6.86\)\(\Omega\).

### 3.16 Potentiometer

This is a versatile instrument. It is basically a long piece of uniform wire, sometimes a few meters in length across which a standard cell is connected. In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces placed side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip. (Fig. 3.28). In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical portions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of the wire.

A current \(I\) flows through the wire which can be varied by a variable resistance (rheostat, \(R\) in the circuit. Since the wire is uniform, the potential difference between A and any point at a distance \(I\) from A is

\[\varepsilon(I)=\phi I \tag{3.89}\]

where \(\phi\) is the potential drop per unit length.

Figure 3.28 (a) shows an application of the potentiometer to compare the emf of two cells of emf \(\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(\varepsilon_{2}\). The points marked 1, 2, 3 form a two way key. Consider first a position of the key where 1 and 3 are connected so that the galvanometer is connected to \(\varepsilon_{1}\). The jockey is moved along the wire till at a point N\({}_{1}\), at a distance \(l_{1}\) from A, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. We can apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to the closed loop AN\({}_{1}\)G31A and get,

\[\phi\,l_{1}+0-\varepsilon_{1}=0 \tag{3.90}\]

Similarly, if another emf \(\varepsilon_{2}\) is balanced against \(\underline{l}_{2}\) (AN\({}_{2}\))

\[\phi\,l_{2}+0-\varepsilon_{2}=0 \tag{3.91}\]

From the last two equations

\[\underline{\varepsilon_{1}}_{2}=\underline{l_{1}} \tag{3.92}\]

This simple mechanism thus allows one to compare the emf's of any two sources. In practice one of the cells is chosen as a standard cell whose emf is known to a high degree of accuracy. The emf of the other cell is then easily calculated from Eq. (3.92).

We can also use a potentiometer to measure internal resistance of a cell (Fig. 3.28 (b)). For this the cell (emf \(\varepsilon\)) whose internal resistance (\(\eta\)) is to be determined is connected across a resistance box through a key K\({}_{2}\), as shown in the figure. With key K\({}_{2}\) open, balance is obtained at length \(l_{1}\) (AN\({}_{1}\)). Then,

\[\varepsilon=\phi\,l_{1} \tag{3.93a}\]

When key K\({}_{2}\) is closed, the cell sends a current (\(I\)) through the resistance box (\(R\)). If \(V\) is the terminal potential difference of the cell and balance is obtained at length \(\underline{l}_{2}\) (AN\({}_{2}\)).

\[V=\phi\,l_{2} \tag{3.93b}\]So, we have \(\varepsilon/V=l_{1}/l_{2}\)

But, \(\varepsilon=I(r+R)\) and \(V=IR\). This gives

\(\varepsilon/V=(r+R)/R\)

From Eq. [3.94(a)] and [3.94(b)] we have

\((R+r)/R=l_{1}/l_{2}\)

\(r=R\left(\frac{l_{1}}{l_{2}}-1\right)\)

Using Eq. (3.95) we can find the internal resistance of a given cell.

The potentiometer has the advantage that it draws _no current_ from the voltage source being measured. As such it is unaffected by the internal resistance of the source.

**Example 3.10**: A resistance of \(R\)\(\Omega\) draws current from a potentiometer. The potentiometer has a total resistance \(R_{0}\)\(\Omega\) (Fig. 3.29). A voltage \(V\) is supplied to the potentiometer. Derive an expression for the voltage across \(R\) when the sliding contact is in the middle of the potentiometer.

**Solution**: While the slide is in the middle of the potentiometer only half of its resistance (\(R_{0}\)/2) will be between the points A and B. Hence, the total resistance between A and B, say, \(R_{1}\), will be given by the following expression:

\(\frac{1}{R_{1}}\)=\(\frac{1}{R}\)+\(\frac{1}{(R_{0}/2)}\)

\(R_{1}\)=\(\frac{R_{0}R}{R_{0}+2R}\)

The total resistance between A and C will be sum of resistance between A and B and C, i.e., \(R_{1}+R_{0}/2\)

\(\therefore\) The current flowing through the potentiometer will be

\(I=\frac{V}{R_{1}+R_{0}/2}=\frac{2V}{2R_{1}+R_{0}}\)

The voltage \(V_{1}\) taken from the potentiometer will be the product of current \(I\) and resistance \(R_{1}\).

\(V_{1}=I\,R_{1}=\left(\frac{2V}{2R_{1}+R_{0}}\right)\times R_{1}\)

## Summary

1. _Current_ through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing per unit time through the area.
2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which an external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential energy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the charge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal of the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or _emf_, of the source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference between the two terminals of a source in open circuit.
3. _Ohm's law_: The electric current \(I\) flowing through a substance is proportional to the voltage \(V\) across its ends, i.e., \(V\approx I\) or \(V=RI\), where \(R\) is called the _resistance_ of the substance. The unit of resistance is ohm: \(1\Omega=1\) V A\({}^{1}\).
4. The _resistance_\(R\) of a conductor depends on its length \(l\) and constant cross-sectional area \(A\) through the relation, \(R=\frac{\rho l}{A}\) where \(\rho\), called _resistivity_ is a property of the material and depends on temperature and pressure.
5. _Electrical resistivity_ of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals have low resistivity, in the range of \(10^{-8}\)\(\Omega\) m to \(10^{-6}\)\(\Omega\) m. Insulators like glass and rubber have \(10^{22}\) to \(10^{24}\) times greater resistivity. Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of resistivity on a logarithmic scale.
6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some cases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and negative ions carry the electric current.
7. _Current density_\(\mathbf{j}\) gives the amount of charge flowing per second per unit area normal to the flow, \(\mathbf{j}=nq\,\mathbf{v}_{d}\) where \(n\) is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge carriers each of charge \(q\), and \(\mathbf{v}_{d}\) is the _drift velocity_ of the charge carriers. For electrons \(q=-e\). If \(\mathbf{j}\) is normal to a cross-sectional area \(\mathbf{A}\) and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current \(I\) through the area is \(nev_{d}A\).

Using \(E=V/I\), \(I=nev_{{}_{d}}A\), and Ohm's law, one obtains \(\frac{eE}{m}=\rho\frac{ne^{2}}{m}v_{{}_{d}}\) The proportionality between the _force eE_ on the electrons in a metal due to the external field \(E\) and the drift velocity \(v_{{}_{d}}\) (not acceleration) can be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions with ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisions occur on an average at a time interval \(\tau\), \(v_{{}_{d}}=\alpha\tau=eE\tau/m\) where \(a\) is the acceleration of the electron. This gives \(\rho=\frac{m}{ne^{2}\tau}\)
9. In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with temperature, the _temperature coefficient of resistivity_\(\alpha\) is defined as the fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.
10. Ohm's law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental law of nature. It fails if 1. \(V\) depends on \(I\) non-linearly. 2. the relation between \(V\) and \(I\) depends on the sign of \(V\) for the same absolute value of \(V\). 3. The relation between \(V\) and \(I\) is non-unique. An example of (a) is when \(\rho\) increases with \(I\) (even if temperature is kept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the feature (c).
11. When a source of emf \(e\) is connected to an external resistance \(R\), the voltage \(V_{{}_{ext}}\) across \(R\) is given by \(V_{{}_{ext}}=IR=\frac{e}{R+r}R\) where \(r\) is the _internal resistance_ of the source.
12. 1. Total resistance \(R\) of \(n\) resistors connected in _series_ is given by \(R=R_{1}+R_{2}+\ldots+R_{n}\) 2. Total resistance \(R\) of \(n\) resistors connected in _parallel_ is given by \(\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\ldots+\frac{1}{R_{n}}\)
13. _Kurchoff's Rules_ - 1. _Junction Rule:_ At any junction of circuit elements, the sum of currents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents leaving it. 2. _Loop Rule:_ The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop must be zero.
14. The _Wheatstone bridge_ is an arrangement of four resistances - R\({}_{i}\), R\({}_{2}\), R\({}_{3}\), R\({}_{4}\) as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by \(\frac{R}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{3}}{R_{4}}\) using which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing the other three resistances.
15. The _potentiometer_ is a device to compare potential differences. Since the method involves a condition of _no_ current flow, the device can be used to measure potential difference; internal resistance of a cell and compare emf's of two sources.

## 6 Points to Ponder

1. Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow. Currents do not obey the law of vector addition. That current is a scalar also follows from it's definition. The current \(I\) through an area of cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors: \(I=\mathbf{j}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{S}\) where \(\mathbf{j}\) and \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\) are vectors.
2. Refer to _V-I_ curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A resistor obeys Ohm's law while a diode does not. The assertion that \(V=IR\) is a statement of Ohm's law is not true. This equation defines resistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether they obey Ohm's law or not. The Ohm's law asserts that the plot of \(I\) versus \(V\) is linear i.e., \(R\) is independent of \(V\). Equation \(\mathbf{E}=\rho\,\mathbf{j}\) leads to another statement of Ohm's law, i.e., a conducting material obeys Ohm's law when the resistivity of the material does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied electric field.
3. Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure germanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm's law within some range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong, there are departures from Ohm's law in all cases.
4. Motion of conduction electrons in electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is the sum of (0) motion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to \(\mathbf{E}\). The motiondue to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute to \(v_{d}\) (Chapter 11, Textbook of Class Xl). \(v_{d}\), thus is only due to applied electric field on the electron.
5. The relation \(\mathbf{j}=\rho\ \mathbf{v}\) should be applied to each type of charge carriers separately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge density arises from both positive and negative charges: \(\mathbf{j}=\rho,\mathbf{v},+\rho\ \mathbf{v}\). \(\rho=\rho_{+}\ \rho\). Now in a neutral wire carrying electric current, \(\rho_{+}=-\rho\). Further, \(v_{+}-0\) which gives \(\rho=0\). \(\mathbf{j}=\rho\). \(\mathbf{v}\) Thus, the relation \(\mathbf{j}=\rho\ \mathbf{v}\) does not apply to the total current charge density.
6. Kirchhoff's junction rule is based on conservation of charge and the outgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at a junction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validity of Kirchhoff's junction rule.

## Chapter Four MOVING CHARGES AND MASTEISM

### 4.1 Introduction

Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000 years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was realised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration in the summer of 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1[a]. It is noticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the earth's magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1[b]]. The deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the wire. Iron fillings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1[c]]. Oersted concluded that _moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field in the surrounding space._

Footnote *: See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3.

Following this there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated byIn this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons, and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn how currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a cyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are detected by a galvanometer.

In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism, we adopt the following convention: A current or a field (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the paper is depicted by a dot (\(\Theta\)). A current or a field going into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross (\(\otimes\))*. Figures. 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) correspond to these two situations, respectively.

Footnote *: A dot appears like the tip of an arrow pointed at you, a cross is like the feathered tail of an arrow moving away from you.

### 4.2 Magnetic Force

#### 4.2.1 Sources and fields

Before we introduce the concept of a magnetic field **B**, we shall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 about the electric field **E**. We have seen that the interaction between two charges can be considered in two stages. The charge **Q**, the source of the field, produces an electric field **E**, where

Figure 4.1: The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying wire. The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. A ring of compass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is shown when (a) the current emerges out of the plane of the paper, (b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of iron flings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent north poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.

\[\textbf{E}=Q\ \dot{\textbf{r}}\ /\ (4\pi e_{0})r^{2} \tag{1}\]

where \(\dot{\textbf{r}}\) is unit vector along **r**, and the field **E** is a vector field. A charge \(q\) interacts with this field and experiences a force **F** given by

\[\textbf{F}=q\ \textbf{E}=q\ \dot{\textbf{Q}}\ \dot{\textbf{r}}\ /\ (4\pi e_{0})\ r^{2} \tag{2}\]

As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field **E** is not just an artefact but has a physical role. It can convey energy and momentum and is not established instantaneously but takes finite time to propagate. The concept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday and was incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on each point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a function of time. In our discussions in this chapter, we will assume that the fields do not change with time.

The field at a particular point can be due to one or more charges. If there are more charges the fields add vectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that this is called the principle of superposition. Once the field is known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (2).

Just as static charges produce an electric field, the currents or moving charges produce (in addition) a magnetic field, denoted by **B (r)**, again a vector field. It has several basic properties identical to the electric field. It is defined at each point in space (and can in addition depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the principle of superposition: _the magnetic field of several sources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each individual source._

#### Magnetic Field, Lorentz Force

Let us suppose that there is a point charge \(q\) (moving with a velocity **v** and, located at **r** at a given time \(t\)) in presence of both the electric field **E (r)** and the magnetic field **B (r)**. The force on an electric charge \(q\) due to both of them can be written as

\[\textbf{F}=q\ \textbf{[E(r)+\ \psi\times B(r)]=F}_{\text{electric}}+\textbf{F}_{ \text{magnetic}} \tag{3}\]

This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive experiments of Ampere and others. It is called the _Lorentz force_. You have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we look at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following features.

1. It depends on \(q\), **v** and **B** (charge of the particle, the velocity and the magnetic field). _Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a positive charge._
2. The magnetic force \(q\ \textbf{[v\times B]}\) includes a vector product of velocity and magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic field vanish (become zero) if velocity and magnetic field are parallel or anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Its direction is given by the screw rule or right hand rule for vector (or cross) product as illustrated in Fig. 4.2.
3. The magnetic force is zero if charge is not moving (as then \(\left|\textbf{v}\right|=0\)). Only a moving charge feels the magnetic force.

The expression for the magnetic force helps us to define the unit of the magnetic field, if one takes \(q\), **F** and **v**, all to be unity in the force equation \(\textbf{F}=q\left[\textbf{v}\times\textbf{B}\right]=q\upsilon\,b\,\textbf{sin}\)\(\theta\)**in**\(\theta\)**in**\(\theta\)**in**,**,** where \(\theta\) is the angle between **v** and **B** [see Fig. 4.2 (a)]. The magnitude of magnetic field \(B\) is 1 SI unit, when the force acting on a unit charge (1 C), moving perpendicular to **B** with a speed 1m/s, is one newton.

Dimensionally, we have \(\left|B\right|=\left|F/q\right|\) and the unit of **B** are Newton second / (coulomb metre). This unit is called _tesla_ (T) named after Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A smaller unit (non-SI) called _gauss_ (=10\({}^{\text{-}4}\) tesla) is also often used. The earth's magnetic field is about \(3.6\times 10^{\text{-}5}\) T. Table 4.1 lists magnetic fields over a wide range in the universe.

#### 4.2.3 Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor

We can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single moving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a uniform cross-sectional area \(A\) and length \(l\). We shall assume one kind of mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number density of these mobile charge carriers in it be \(n\). Then the total number of mobile charge carriers in it is \(nAL\). For a steady current \(I\) in this conducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average

Figure 4.2: The direction of the magnetic force acting on a charged particle. (a) The force on a positively charged particle with velocity **v** and making an angle \(\theta\) with the magnetic field **B** is given by the right-hand rule. (b) A moving charged particle \(q\) is deflected in an opposite sense to \(\neg q\) in the presence of magnetic field.

drift velocity \(\textbf{v}_{d}\) (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic field **B**, the force on these carriers is:

\[\textbf{F}=(n\textbf{\lambda})q\textbf{v}_{d}\textbf{x}\textbf{B}\]

where \(q\) is the value of the charge on a carrier. Now \(n\textbf{\omega}_{d}\) is the current density **j** and \(|\left\{n\textbf{\omega}_{d}\right\}|\) \(A\) is the current \(I\) (see Chapter 3 for the discussion of current and current density). Thus,

\[\textbf{F}=[[n\textbf{\omega}\textbf{\omega}_{d}]\textbf{\lambda}]\times \textbf{B}=[\textbf{\lambda}\textbf{\lambda}]\times\textbf{B} \tag{4.4}\] \[=\Pi\textbf{x}\textbf{B}\]

where **I** is a vector of magnitude \(I\), the length of the rod, and with a direction identical to the current \(I\). Note that the current \(I\) is not a vector. In the last step leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from **j** to **I**.

Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, **B** is the external magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force on it by considering it as a collection of linear strips \(\text{d}\textbf{j}\) and summing

\[\textbf{F}=\sum_{j}\text{Id}\textbf{\lambda}\textbf{\times B}\]

This summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.

## 5 On permeability and permeability

In the universal law of gravitation, we say that any two point masses exert a force on each other which is proportional to the product of the masses \(m_{i}\), \(m_{\text{\tiny{2}}}\) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \(r\) between them. We write it as \(F\) = _Gm_,\(m_{\text{\tiny{2}}}/r^{2}\) where \(G\) is the universal constant of gravitation. Similarly in Coulomb's law of electrostatics we write the force between two point charges \(q_{1}\), \(q_{2}\), separated by a distance \(r\) as \(F\) = \(\kappa q_{1}q_{2}/r^{2}\) where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality. In SI units, \(k\) is taken as \(1/4\pi\varepsilon\) where _\(\varepsilon\)_ is the permittivity of the medium. Also in magnetism, we get another constant, which in SI units, is taken as \(\mu/4\pi\) where _\(\mu\)_ is the permeability of the medium.

Although \(G\), _\(\varepsilon\)_ and _\(\mu\)_ arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between gravitational force and electromagnetic force. While the gravitational force does not depend on the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between the two charges or magnets. Hence while \(G\) is a universal constant, _\(\varepsilon\)_ and _\(\mu\)_ depend on the medium. They have different values for different media. The product _\(\varepsilon\mu\)_ turns out to be related to the speed \(v\) of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through _\(\varepsilon\mu\)_=1/_v_\({}^{2}\).

Electric permittivity _\(\varepsilon\)_ is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects and is affected by a medium. It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in response to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the field inside the material. Similarly, magnetic permeability _\(\mu\)_ is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in magnetic fields. It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.

**Example 4.1** A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries a current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontal magnetic field **B** (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magnetic field?

**Solution** : From Eq. (4.4), we find that there is an upward force **F**, of magnitude _IB_.. For mid-air suspension, this must be balanced by the force due to gravity:

\(m\,g=l\,IB\)

\(B=\frac{m\,g}{l\,l}\)

\(=\frac{0.2\times 9.8}{2\times 1.5}=0.65\) T

Note that it would have been sufficient to specify m/l the mass per unit length of the wire. The earth's magnetic field is approximately 4 x 10\({}^{\circ}\) T and we have ignored it.

**Example 4.2**: If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive \(y\)-axis and the charged particle is moving along the positive \(x\)-axis (Fig. 4.4), which way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative charge), (b) a proton (positive charge).

**Solution** : The velocity **v** of particle is along the \(x\)-axis, while **B**, the magnetic field is along the \(y\)-axis, so **v x B** is along the z-axis (screw rule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along -z axis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis.

### 4.3 Motion in a Magnetic Field

We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in a magnetic field. We have learnt in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter 6) that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along (or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motionof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, \(q\mathbf{E}\), which _can_ have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]

We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a _uniform_ magnetic field. First consider the case of \(\mathbf{v}\) perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\). The perpendicular force, \(q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\), acts as a centripetal force and produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field. _The particle will describe a circle \(q\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are perpendicular to each other_ (Fig. 4.5).

If velocity has a component along \(\mathbf{B}\), this component remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will not be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane perpendicular to \(\mathbf{B}\) is as before a circular one, thereby producing a _helical motion_ (Fig. 4.6).

You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI, Chapter 4) that if \(r\) is the radius of the circular path of a particle, then a force of \(m\,v^{2}/r\), acts perpendicular to the path towards the centre of the circle, and is called the centripetal force. If the velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) is perpendicular to the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\), the magnetic force is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) and acts like a centripetal force. It has a magnitude \(q\,v\,B\). Equating the two expressions for centripetal force,

\[m\,v^{2}/r=q\,v\,B,\]

which gives

\[r=m\,v\,/\,\,qB\]

for the radius of the circle described by the charged particle. The larger the momentum, the larger is the radius and bigger the circle described. If \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, then \(v=\omega\,\,r\). So,

\[\omega=2\pi\,v=q\,B/\,m\]

which is independent of the velocity or energy. Here \(v\) is the frequency of rotation. The independence of \(v\) from energy has important application in the design of a cyclotron (see Section 4.4.2).

The time taken for one revolution is \(T=2\pi/\omega=1/v\). If there is a component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field (denoted by \(v_{\parallel}\)), it will make the particle move along the field and the path of the particle would be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic field in one rotation is called pitch \(p\). Using Eq. [4.6 [a]], we have

\[p=v_{\parallel}T=2\pi m\,v_{\parallel}/\,q\,B\]

[4.6(b)]

The radius of the circular component of motion is called the _radius_ of the _helix_.

### 4.4 Motion in Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields

#### 4.4.1 Velocity selector

You know that a charge \(q\) moving with velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) in presence of both electric and magnetic fields experiences a force given by Eq. (4.3), that is,

\[\mathbf{F}=q\left(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\right)=\mathbf{F}_{ \mathrm{E}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{B}}\]

We shall consider the simple case in which electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, as shown in Fig. 4.7. We have,

\[\mathbf{E}=E\,\mathbf{j},\,\mathbf{B}=B\,\hat{\mathbf{k}},\, \mathbf{v}=v\,\hat{\mathbf{i}}\] \[\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{E}}=q\mathbf{E}=qE\,\hat{\mathbf{j}},\, \mathbf{F}_{n}=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B},=q\left(v\,\hat{\mathbf{i}}\, \mathbf{v}\,B\hat{\mathbf{k}}\right)=-qB\,\hat{\mathbf{j}}\]

Therefore, \(\mathbf{F}=q(E-vB)\,\hat{\mathbf{j}}\).

Thus, electric and magnetic forces are in opposite directions as shown in the figure. Suppose, we adjust the value of \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) such that magnitude of the two forces are equal. Then, total force on the charge is zero and the charge will move in the fields undeflected. This happens when,

\[qE=qvB\,\,\,\,\mathrm{or}\,\,\,\,v=\frac{E}{B} \tag{4.7}\]

This condition can be used to select charged particles of a particular velocity out of a beam containing charges moving with different speeds (irrespective of their charge and mass). The crossed \(E\) and \(B\) fields, therefore, serve as a _velocity selector_. Only particles with speed \(E/B\) pass undeflected through the region of crossed fields. This method was employed by J. J. Thomson in 1897 to measure the charge to mass ratio (\(e/m\)) of an electron. The principle is also employed in Mass Spectrometer - a device that separates charged particles, usually ions, according to their charge to mass ratio.

#### 4.4.2 Cyclotron

The cyclotron is a machine to accelerate charged particles or ions to high energies. It was invented by E.O. Lawrence and M.S. Livingston in 1934 to investigate nuclear structure. The cyclotron uses both electric and magnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles. As the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called _crossed fields_. Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the charged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy. The particles move most of the time inside two semicircular disc-like metal containers, \(\mathrm{D}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{D}_{2}\), which are called _dees_ as they look like the letter D. Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron. Inside the metal boxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field. The magnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a circular path inside a dee. Every time the particle moves from one dee to another it is acted upon by the electric field. The sign of the electric field is changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle. This ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field. Each time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle. As energyincreases, the radius of the circular path increases. So the path is a spiral one.

The whole assembly is evacuated to minimise collisions between the ions and the air molecules. A high frequency alternating voltage is applied to the dees. In the sketch shown in Fig. 4.8, positive ions or positively charged particles (e.g., protons) are released at the centre P. They move in a semi-circular path in one of the dees and arrive in the gap between the dees in a time interval \(T/2\); where \(T\), the period of revolution, is given by Eq. (4.6).

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{T}}=\frac{1}{\nu_{c}}=\frac{2\pi m}{qB}\]

or \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}_{c}=\frac{qB}{2\pi m}\) (4.8)

This frequency is called the _cyclotron frequency_ for obvious reasons and is denoted by \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}_{c}\).

The frequency \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}_{a}\) of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the polarity of the dees is reversed in the same time that it takes the ions to complete one half of the revolution. The requirement \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}_{a}=\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}_ {c}\) is called the _resonance condition_. The phase of the supply is adjusted so that when the positive ions arrive at the edge of \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{D}}_{1}\), \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{D}}_{2}\) is at a lower potential and the ions are accelerated across the gap. Inside the dees the particles travel in a region free of the electric field. The increase in their kinetic energy is \(qV\) each time they cross from one dee to another (\(V\)refers to the voltage across the dees at that time). From Eq. (4.5), it is clear that the radius of their path goes on increasing each time their kinetic energy increases. The ions are repeatedly accelerated across the dees until they have the required energy to have a radius approximately that of the dees. They are then deflected by a magnetic field and leave the system via an exit slit. From Eq. (4.5) we have,

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{v}}=\frac{qBR}{m} \tag{4.9}\]

where \(R\) is the radius of the trajectory at exit, and equals the radius of a dee.

Hence, the kinetic energy of the ions is,

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{\frac{1}{2}}}mv^{2}=\frac{q^{2}B^{2}R^{2}}{2m} \tag{4.10}\]

The operation of the cyclotron is based on the fact that the time for one revolution of an ion is independent of its speed or radius of its orbit. The cyclotron is used to bombard nuclei with energetic particles, so accelerated by it, and study the resulting nuclear reactions. It is also used to implant ions into solids and modify their properties or even synthesise new materials. It is used in hospitals to produce radioactive substances which can be used in diagnosis and treatment.

**Example 4.4**: A cyclotron's oscillator frequency is 10 MHz. What should be the operating magnetic field for accelerating protons? If the radius of its 'does' is 60 cm, what is the kinetic energy (in MeV) of the proton beam produced by the accelerator.

(\(e=\)1.60 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\) C, \(m_{p}=\) 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) kg. 1 MeV = 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-13}\) J).

**Solution** The oscillator frequency should be same as proton's cyclotron frequency.

Using Eqs. (4.5) and [4.6(a)] we have

\(B=\) 2\(\pi\)\(\nu\)/\(q\) =6.3 \(\times\)1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\)\(\times\) 10\({}^{7}\) / (1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\)) = 0.66 T

Final velocity of protons is

\(v=\)\(r\times\) 2\(\pi\)\(\nu\) = 0.6 m \(\times\) 6.3 \(\times\)10\({}^{7}\) = 3.78 \(\times\) 10\({}^{7}\) m/s.

\(E=\) 1\(\%\)\(m\)\({}^{2}\) = 1.67 \(\times\)10\({}^{27}\)\(\times\) 14.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) / (2 \(\times\) 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-13}\)) = 7 MeV.

## 5 Accelerators in the Bade

India has been an early entrant in the area of accelerator- based research. The vision of Dr. Meghmath Saha created a 37" Cyclotron in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata in 1953. This was soon followed by a series of Cockroft-Walton type of accelerators established in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh, Bose Institute, Kolkata and Andra University, Walitar.

The skites saw the commissioning of a number of Van de Graaff accelerators: a 5.5 MV terminal machine in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai (1963); a 2 MV terminal machine in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; a 400 kV terminal machine in Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi; and Punjlab University, Patiala. One 66 cm Cyclotron donated by the Rochester University of USA was commissioned in Panjab University, Chandigarh. A small electron accelerator was also established in University of Pune, Pune.

In a major initiative taken in the seventies and eighties, a Variable Energy Cyclotron was built indigenously in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Kolkata; 2 MV Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator was developed and built in BARC and a 14 MV Tandem Pelletron accelerator was installed in TIFR.

This was soon followed by a 15 MV Tandem Pelletron established by University Grants Commission (UGC), as an inter-university facility in Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi; a 3 MV Tandem Pelletron in Institute of Physics, Bhubaneshwar; and two 1.7 MV Tandetrons in Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, Hyderabad and Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. Both TIFR and IUAC are augmenting their facilities with the addition of superconducting LINAC modules to accelerate the ions to higher energies.

Besides these ion accelerators, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has developed many electron accelerators. A 2 GeV Synchrotron Radiation Source is being built in Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technologies, Indore.

The Department of Atomic Energy is considering Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) for power production and fissile material breeding as future options.

### 4.5 Magnetic Field due to a Current Element, Biot-Savart Law

All magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving charges) and due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles. Here, we shall study the relation between current and the magnetic field it produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart's law. Figure 4.9 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current \(I\). Consider an infinitesimal element \(\mathrm{d}I\) of the conductor. The magnetic field \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}\) due to this element is to be determined at a point \(\mathbf{P}\) which is at a distance \(r\) from it. Let \(\theta\) be the angle between \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) and the displacement vector \(\mathbf{r}\). According to Biot-Savart's law, the magnitude of the magnetic field \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}\) is proportional to the current \(I\), the element length \(\left|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\right|\), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \(r\). Its direction* is perpendicular to the plane containing \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) and \(\mathbf{r}\). Thus, in vector notation,

Footnote *: The sense of \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\mathbf{x}\) is also given by the _Right Hand Screw rule_ : Look at the plane containing vectors \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) and \(\mathbf{r}\). Imagine moving from the first vector towards second vector. If the movement is anticlockwise, the resultant is towards you. If it is clockwise, the resultant is away from you.

\[\begin{split}\overset{\cdot}{d}\mathbf{B}& \approx\frac{Id\,\mathbf{l}\times\mathbf{r}}{r^{3}}\\ &=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{Id\,\mathbf{l}\times\mathbf{r}}{r^{3} }\end{split}\] (4.11(a))

where \(\mu_{0}/4\pi\) is a constant of proportionality. The above expression holds when the medium is vacuum.

The magnitude of this field is,

\[\left|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}\right|=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{Id\,\mathrm{l}\sin \theta}{r^{2}}\] (4.11(b))

where we have used the property of cross-product. Equation (4.11(a)) constitutes our basic equation for the magnetic field. The proportionality constant in \(\mathrm{Si}\) units has the exact value,

\[\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}=10^{\cdot 7}\,\mathrm{Tm}/\mathrm{A}\] (4.11(c))

We call \(\mu_{0}\) the _permeability_ of free space (or vacuum).

The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities as well as differences with the Coulomb's law for the electrostatic field. Some of these are:

* Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of distance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of superposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that the magnetic field is _linear_ in the _source_\(I\)\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) just as the electrostatic field is linear in its source: the electric charge.]
* The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source

**(iii)** The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the source and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane containing the displacement vector **r** and the current element \(I\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\).
**(iv)** There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not present in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.9, the magnetic field at any point in the direction of \(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{l}\) (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line, \(\theta=0\), sin \(\theta=0\) and from Eq. [4.11(a)], \(|\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}|=0\).

There is an interesting relation between \(\epsilon_{0}\), the permittivity of free space; \(\mu_{\mathrm{c}}\), the permeability of free space; and \(c\), the speed of light in vacuum:

\[\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}=\left(4\pi\epsilon_{0}\right)\left(\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \right)^{\cdot}=\left(\frac{1}{9\times 10^{9}}\right)\left(10^{-7}\right)=\frac{1}{ \left(3\times 10^{9}\right)^{2}}\ =\frac{1}{c^{2}}\]

We will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the electromagnetic waves. Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant, the product \(\mu_{0}\epsilon_{0}\) is fixed in magnitude. Choosing the value of either \(\epsilon_{0}\) or \(\mu_{0}\), fixes the value of the other. In SI units, \(\mu_{0}\) is fixed to be equal to \(4\pi\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{m}\) magnitude.

**Example 4.5** An element \(\Delta\mathbf{l}=\Delta x\,\mathbf{\hat{l}}\) is placed at the origin and carries a large current \(I=10\) A (Fig. 4.10). What is the magnetic field on the \(y\)-axis at a distance of \(0.5\) m. \(\Delta x=1\) cm.

**Solution**

\(|\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}|=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{I\,\mathrm{d}\mathrm{l}\sin \theta}{r^{2}}\) [using Eq. (4.11)]

\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}=\Delta x=10^{-2}\,\mathrm{m}\,,\,I=10\,\mathrm{A}\), \(r=0.5\) m = \(y\). \(\mu_{0}\,/\,4\pi=10^{-7}\,\frac{\mathrm{T}\,\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{A}}\)

\(\theta=90^{\circ}\) ; sin \(\theta=1\)

\(|\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}|=\frac{10^{-7}\times 10\times 10^{-2}}{25\times 10^{ 2}}=4\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{T}\)

The direction of the field is in the \(+\)z-direction. This is so since,

\(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\,\mathbf{x}\,\mathbf{r}=\Delta x\,\mathbf{\hat{l}}\, \mathbf{x}\,\mathbf{y}\,\mathbf{\hat{j}}=y\,\Delta x\,\mathbf{\hat{l}}\, \mathbf{x}\,\mathbf{\hat{j}}=y\,\Delta x\,\mathbf{\hat{k}}\)

We remind you of the following cyclic property of cross-products,

\(\mathbf{\hat{i}}\times\mathbf{j}=\mathbf{\hat{k}}\); \(\mathbf{\hat{j}}\times\mathbf{\hat{k}}=\mathbf{\hat{i}}\); \(\mathbf{\hat{k}}\times\mathbf{\hat{i}}=\mathbf{\hat{j}}\)

Note that the field is small in magnitude.

In the next section, we shall use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field due to a circular loop.

### 4.6 Magnetic Field on the Axis of a Circular Current Loop

In this section, we shall evaluate the magnetic field due to a circular coil along its axis. The evaluation entails summing up the effect of infinitesimal current elements (\(I\)d) mentioned in the previous section. We assume that the current \(I\) is steady and that the evaluation is carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum).

Figure 4.11 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady current \(I\). The loop is placed in the \(y\)-\(z\) plane with its centre at the origin O and has a radius \(R\). The \(x\)-axis is the axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic field at the point P on this axis. Let \(x\) be the distance of P from the centre O of the loop.

Consider a conducting element \(\mathbf{dl}\) of the loop. This is shown in Fig. 4.11. The magnitude \(\mathrm{d}B\) of the magnetic field due to \(\mathbf{dl}\)is given by the Biot-Savart law [Eq. 4.11[a]],

\[\mathrm{d}B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{I[\mathbf{dl}\ \mathbf{x}\ \mathbf{r}]}{r^{3}} \tag{4.12}\]

Now \(r^{2}=x^{2}+R^{2}\). Further, any element of the loop will be perpendicular to the displacement vector from the element to the axial point. For example, the element \(\mathbf{dl}\) in Fig. 4.11 is in the \(y\)-\(z\) plane whereas the displacement vector \(\mathbf{r}\) from \(\mathbf{dl}\) to the axial point P is in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Hence \(|\ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\ \mathbf{x}\ \mathbf{r}|=r\,dl\). Thus,

\[\mathrm{d}B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\mathrm{d}I\mathrm{d}}{\left(x^{2}+R^{2 }\right)} \tag{4.13}\]

The direction of \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}\) is shown in Fig. 4.11. It is perpendicular to the plane formed by \(\mathbf{dl}\) and \(\mathbf{r}\). It has an \(x\)-component \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}_{x}\) and a component perpendicular to \(x\)-axis, \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}_{z}\). When the components perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result. For example, the \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}_{z}\) component due to \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) is cancelled by the contribution due to the diametrically opposite \(\mathbf{dl}\) element, shown in Fig. 4.11. Thus, only the \(x\)-component survives. The net contribution along \(x\)-direction can be obtained by integrating \(\mathrm{d}B_{x}=\mathrm{d}B\cos\theta\) over the loop. For Fig. 4.11,

\[\cos\theta=\frac{R}{\left(x^{2}+R^{2}\right)^{1/2}} \tag{4.14}\]

From Eqs. (4.13) and (4.14),

\[\mathrm{d}B_{x}=\frac{\mu_{0}\mathrm{d}I\mathrm{d}}{4\pi}\frac{R}{\left(x^{2 }+R^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\]

Figure 4.11: Magnetic field on the axis of a current carrying circular loop of radius \(R\). Shown are the magnetic field \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}\) [due to a line element \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}\) ] and its components along and perpendicular to the axis.

The summation of elements \(\mathrm{d}l\) over the loop yields \(2\pi R\), the circumference of the loop. Thus, the magnetic field at P due to entire circular loop is

\[\mathbf{B}=B_{x}\hat{\mathbf{i}}=\frac{\mu_{o}I\,R^{2}}{2\left(x^{2}+R^{2}\right) ^{3/2}}\hat{\mathbf{i}} \tag{4.15}\]

As a special case of the above result, we may obtain the field at the centre of the loop. Here \(x=0\), and we obtain,

\[\mathbf{B}_{0}=\frac{\mu_{o}I}{2R}\hat{\mathbf{i}} \tag{4.16}\]

The magnetic field lines due to a circular wire form closed loops and are shown in Fig. 4.12. The direction of the magnetic field is given by (another) _right-hand thumb rule_ stated below:

_Curl the palm of your right hand around the circular wire with the fingers pointing in the direction of the current. The right-hand thumb gives the direction of the magnetic field._

**Example 4.6**: A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into a semi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.13(a). Consider the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) at the centre of the arc. (a) What is the magnetic field due to the straight segments? (b) In what way the contribution to \(\mathbf{B}\) from the semicircle differs from that of a circular loop and in what way does it resemble? (c) Would your answer be different if the wire were bent into a semi-circular arc of the same radius but in the opposite way as shown in Fig. 4.13(b)?

Figure 4.12: The magnetic field lines for a current loop. The direction of the field is given by the right-hand thumb rule described in the text. The upper side of the loop may be thought of as the north pole and the lower side as the south pole of a magnet.

### Ampere's Circuital Law

There is an alternative and appealing way in which the Biot-Savart law may be expressed. Ampere's circuital law considers an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing through it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small line elements. Consider one such element of length _dl_. We take the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, \(B_{r}\) at this element and multiply it by the length of that element _dl_ [Note: B_dl_=**B**_d_**l]. All such products are added together. We consider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere's law states that this integral is equal to \(\mu_{0}\) times the total current passing through the surface, i.e.,

\[\dot{\oint}\textbf{B-d}\textbf{l}=\mu_{0}I\] (4.17a) where \[I\] is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken over the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The relation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule. Let the fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is traversed in the loop integral \[\textbf{jB-d}\textbf{l}\]. Then the direction of the thumb gives the sense in which the current \[I\] is regarded as positive.

For several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4.17a] proves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to choose the loop (called an _american loop_) such that at each point of the loop, _either_

Figure 4.14:

**(i)**: **B** is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero _constant_ B, _or_
**(ii)**: **B** is normal to the loop, _or_
**(iii)**: **B** vanishes.

Now, let \(L\) be the length (part) of the loop for which **B** is tangential. Let _I_e be the current enclosed by the loop. Then, Eq. (4.17) reduces to,

_BL_=_\(\mu_{0}\)I_e_ [4.17(b)]

When there is a system with a symmetry such as for a _straight infinite current-carrying wire_ in Fig. 4.15, the Ampere's law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic field, much the same way Gauss' law helps in determination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the Example 4.8 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the circumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand side of Eq. (4.17 [b]), B. 2\(\pi r\). We find that the magnetic field at a distance \(r\) outside the wire is _tangential_ and given by

\[B\times 2\pi r = \mu_{0}\,I,\] \[B=\mu_{0}\,I/(2\pi r) \tag{4.18}\]

The above result for the infinite wire is interesting from several points of view.

It implies that the field at every point on a circle of radius \(r\), (with the wire along the axis), is same in magnitude. In other words, the magnetic field possesses what is called a _cylindrical symmetry_. The field that normally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: \(r\). Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.
**(ii)**: The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form concentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron fillings form concentric circles. These lines called _magnetic field lines_ form closed loops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate from positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression for the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical justification to Oersted's experiments.
**(iii)**: Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is infinite, the field due to it at a nonzero distance is _not_ infinite. It tends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The field is directly proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.

(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field due to a long wire. This rule, called the _right-hand rule*_, is:

Footnote *: Note that there are _two distinct_ right-hand rules: One which gives the direction of **B** on the axis of current-loop and the other which gives direction of **B** for a straight conducting wire. Fingers and thumb play different roles in the two.

_Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the direction of the magnetic field._

Ampere's circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law. Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same physical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere's law is to Biot-Savart law, what Gauss's law is to Coulomb's law. Both, Ampere's and Gauss's law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary (magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source, in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere's circuital law holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The following example will help us understand what is meant by the term enclosed current.

**Example 4.8**: Figure 4.15 shows a long straight wire of a circular cross-section (radius \(a\)) carrying steady current \(I\). The current \(I\) is uniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the magnetic field in the region \(r<a\) and \(r>a\).

**Solution (a) Consider the case \(r>a\). The Amperian loop, labelled 2, is a circle concentric with the cross-section. For this loop, \(L=2\pi\,r\)

\(I_{r}=\) Current enclosed by the loop = \(I\)

The result is the familiar expression for a long straight wire

\(B(2\pi\,\eta)=\mu_{0}I\)

\(B=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\,\pi\,r}\) [4.19(a)]

\(B\propto\frac{1}{r}\) (\(r>a\))

(b) Consider the case \(r<a\). The Amperian loop is a circle labelled 1. For this loop, taking the radius of the circle to be \(r\), \(L=2\pi\,r\)
It should be noted that while Ampere's circutal law holds for any loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in every case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in Section 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression \(B=\mu_{o}I/2R\) [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However, there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law can be conveniently applied. We shall use it in the next section to calculate the magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful magnetic systems: the _solenoid_ and the _toroid_.

### The Solenoid and the Toroid

The solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate magnetic fields. The television uses the solenoid to generate magnetic fields needed. The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate the high magnetic fields required. In both, solenoid and toroid, we come across a situation of high symmetry where Ampere's law can be conveniently applied.

Figure (4.16) shows a plot of the magnitude of \(\mathbf{B}\) with distance \(r\) from the centre of the wire. The direction of the field is tangential to the respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand rule described earlier in this section.

#### 4.8.1 The solenoid

We shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the solenoid's length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely spaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop. The net magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.

Figure 4.17 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.17(a). Figure 4.17(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In Fig. 4.17(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field between two neighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.17(b), see that the field at the interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid. The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet. Figure 4.18 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid approaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.

Figure 4.18: The magnetic field of a very long solenoid. We consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd to determine the field.

Figure 4.17: (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been stretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel. (b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.

Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero as argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component is zero. Thus, these two sections make no contribution. Let the field along ab be \(B\). Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, \(L=h\).

Let \(n\) be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number of turns is \(nh\). The enclosed current is, \(I_{e}=I\,(n\,h)\), where \(I\) is the current in the solenoid. From Ampere's circutal law [Eq. 4.17 [b]]

\[BL=\mu_{0}I_{e},\quad B\,h=\mu_{0}I\,(n\,h)\]

\[B=\mu_{0}\,n\,I \tag{4.20}\]

The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the next chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core inside the solenoid.

#### The toroid

The toroid is a hollow circular ring on which a large number of turns of a wire are closely wound. It can be viewed as a solenoid which has been bent into a circular shape to close on itself. It is shown in Fig. 4.19(a) carrying a current \(I\). We shall see that the magnetic field in the open space inside (point P) and exterior to the toroid (point Q) is zero. The field \(\mathbf{B}\) inside the toroid is constant in magnitude for the _ideal_ toroid of closely wound turns.

Figure 4.19(b) shows a sectional view of the toroid. The direction of the magnetic field inside is clockwise as per the right-hand thumb rule for circular loops. Three circular Amperian loops 1, 2 and 3 are shown by dashed lines. By symmetry, the magnetic field should be tangential to each of them and constant in magnitude for a given loop. The circular areas bounded by loops 2 and 3 both cut the toroid: so that each turn of current carrying wire is cut once by the loop 2 and twice by the loop 3.

Let the magnetic field along loop 1 be \(B_{1}\) in magnitude. Then in Ampere's circutal law [Eq. 4.17[a]], \(L=2\pi\ r_{1}\). However, the loop encloses no current, so \(I_{e}=0\). Thus,

\[B_{1}\,(2\pi\ r_{1})=\mu_{0}\{0\},\quad B_{1}=0\]

Thus, the magnetic field at any point P in the open space inside the toroid is zero.

We shall now show that magnetic field at Q is likewise zero. Let the magnetic field along loop 3 be \(B_{3}\). Once again from Ampere's law \(L=2\pi\ r_{3}\). However, from the sectional cut, we see that the current coming out of the plane of the paper is cancelled exactly by the current going into it. Thus, \(I_{e}=0\), and \(B_{3}=0\). Let the magnetic field inside the solenoid be \(B\). We shall now consider the magnetic field at S. Once again we employ Ampere's law in the form of Eq. [4.17 [a]]. We find, \(L=2\pi\ r\).

The current enclosed \(I_{e}\) is (for \(N\) turns of toroidal coil) \(NI\).

Figure 4.19: (a) A toroid carrying a current \(I\). (b) A sectional view of the toroid. The magnetic field can be obtained at an arbitrary distance \(r\) from the centre O of the toroid by Ampere’s circutal law. The dashed lines labelled 1, 2 and 3 are three circular Amperian loops.

\[B=\frac{\mu_{0}N\,N}{2\pi r} \tag{4.21}\]

We shall now compare the two results: for a toroid and solenoid. We re-express Eq. (4.21) to make the comparison easier with the solenoid result given in Eq. (4.20). Let \(r\) be the average radius of the toroid and \(n\) be the number of turns per unit length. Then

\[\begin{array}{ll}N=2\pi r\ n&=\mbox{(average) perimeter of the toroid}\\ &\times\mbox{number of turns per unit length}\end{array}\]

and thus,

\[B=\mu_{0}\,n\,I, \tag{4.22}\]

i.e., the result for the solenoid!

In an ideal toroid the coils are circular. In reality the turns of the toroidal coil form a helix and there is always a small magnetic field external to the toroid.

## Chapter 4 Magnetic compression

We have seen in Section 4.3 [see also the box on helical motion of charged particles earlier in this chapter] that orbits of charged particles are helical. If the magnetic field is non-uniform, but does not change much during one circular orbit, then the radius of the helix will decrease as it enters stronger magnetic field and the radius will increase when it enters weaker magnetic fields. We consider two solenoids at a distance from each other, enclosed in an evacuated container [see figure below where we have not shown the container]. Charged particles moving in the region between the two solenoids will start with a small radius. The radius will increase as field decreases and the radius will decrease again as field due to the second solenoid takes over. The solenoids act as a mirror or reflector. [See the direction of **F** as the particle approaches coil 2 in the figure. It has a horizontal component against the forward motion.] This makes the particles turn back when they approach the solenoid. Such an arrangement will act like _magnetic bottle_ or magnetic container. The particles will never touch the sides of the container. Such magnetic bottles are of great use in confining the high energy plasma in fusion experiments. The plasma will destroy any other form of material container because of it's high temperature. Another useful container is a toroid. Toroids are expected to play a key role in the _tokamak_, an equipment for plasma confinement in fusion power reactors. There is an international collaboration called the _International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor_ (ITER), being set up in France, for achieving controlled fusion, of which India is a collaborating nation. For details of ITER collaboration and the project, you may visit [http://www.iter.org](http://www.iter.org).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:561]

\[F_{\rm ho}=I_{b}\,LB_{a}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{\mu_{0}\,I_{a}\,I_{b}}{2\,\pi\,d}\,L \tag{4.23}\]

It is of course possible to compute the force on 'a' due to 'b'. From considerations similar to above we can find the force \({\bf F}_{\rm ab}\), on a segment of length \(L\) of 'a' due to the current in 'b'. It is equal in magnitude to \(F_{\rm ba}\), and directed towards 'b'. Thus,

\[{\bf F}_{\rm ba}=-{\bf F}_{\rm ab} \tag{4.24}\]

Note that this is consistent with Newton's third Law. Thus, at least for parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the Biot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with Newton's third Law*.

Footnote *: It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in motion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or conductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics is conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even for the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.

We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction attract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel each other. Thus,

_Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel._

This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same sign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other.

Let \(f_{\rm ba}\) represent the magnitude of the force \({\bf F}_{\rm ba}\) per unit length. Then, from Eq. (4.23),

\[f_{\rm ba}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{a}I_{b}}{2\,\pi\,d} \tag{4.25}\]

The above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one of the seven SI base units.

The _ampere_ is the value of that steady current which, when maintained in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce on each of these conductors a force equal to \(2\times 10^{-7}\) newtons per metre of length.

This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical definition. In practice one must eliminate the effect of the earth's magnetic field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate geometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure this mechanical force.

The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in terms of the ampere.

When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of charge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).

**Figure 1:** Schematic plots of the experimental results.

**Figure 2:** The horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field at a certain place is 3.0 \(\times 10^{5}\) T and the direction of the field is from the geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight conductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per unit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the direction of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?

**Solution \(\mathbf{F=\Pi\times B}\)**

_F = \(\mathbf{\Pi\times B}\)_

_The force per unit length is_

_f = F/I = 1 B sin\(\theta\)_

_(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,_

_(b)_ = 90\({}^{\circ}\)_

_Hence,_

_f = \(\mathbf{I\times 3\times 10^{-5}=3\times 10^{-5}\,N\,m^{-1}}\)_

### Torque on Current Loop, Magnetic Dipole

#### 4.10.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform magnetic field

We now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current \(I\) and placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not experience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electric dipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.10).

We first consider the simple case when the rectangular loop is placed such that the uniform magnetic field **B** is in the plane of the loop. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.21(a).

The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC of the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop and exerts a force \(\textbf{F}_{1}\) on it which is directed into the plane of the loop. Its magnitude is,

\(F_{1}=I\,b\,B\)

Similarly it exerts a force \(\textbf{F}_{2}\) on the arm CD and \(\textbf{F}_{2}\) is directed out of the plane of the paper.

\(F_{2}=I\,b\,B=F_{1}\)

Thus, the _net force_ on the loop _is zero_. There is a torque on the loop due to the pair of forces \(\textbf{F}_{1}\) and \(\textbf{F}_{2}\). Figure 4.21(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD end. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate it anti-clockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),

\[\tau =F_{1}\,\frac{\alpha}{2}+F_{2}\,\frac{\alpha}{2}\] \[\cdot\] \[=I\,b\frac{\alpha}{2}+I\,b\frac{\alpha}{2}=I\,(ab)\,B\] \[=I\,A\,B \tag{4.26}\]

where \(A=ab\) is the area of the rectangle.

We next consider the case when the plane of the loop, is not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with it. We take the angle between the field and the normal tothe coil to be angle \(\theta\) (The previous case corresponds to \(\theta=\pi/2\)). Figure 4.22 illustrates this general case.

The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are \(\mathbf{F_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{F_{2}}\). They too are equal and opposite, with magnitude,

\(F_{1}=F_{2}=Ib\,B\)

But they are not collinear! This results in a couple as before. The torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was along the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.22(b) is a view of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces constituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is,

\(\tau=F_{1}\frac{\alpha}{2}\sin\theta+F_{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}\sin\theta\)

\(=I\,ab\,B\sin\theta\)

\(=I\,ab\,B\sin\theta\)

\(=I\,AB\,B\sin\theta\)

As \(\theta\to 0\), the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple also approaches zero. This makes the forces collinear and the net force and torque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil and the magnetic field. We define the _magnetic moment_ of the current loop as,

\(\mathbf{m}=I\,\mathbf{A}\)

where the direction of the area vector \(\mathbf{A}\) is given by the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.21. Then as the angle between \(\mathbf{m}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) is \(\theta\), Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) can be expressed by one expression

\(\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{m}\times\mathbf{B}\)

This is analogous to the electrostatic case (Electric dipole of dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}_{e}\) in an electric field \(\mathbf{E}\)).

\(\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{p}_{e}\times\mathbf{E}\)

As is clear from Eq. (4.28), the dimensions of the magnetic moment are [A][L\({}^{2}\)] and its unit is Am\({}^{2}\).

From Eq. (4.29), we see that the torque \(\tau\) vanishes when \(\mathbf{m}\) is either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\). This indicates a state of equilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any object with a magnetic moment \(\mathbf{m}\)). When \(\mathbf{m}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are parallel the

Figure 4.22: (a) The area vector of the loop ABCD makes an arbitrary angle \(\theta\) with the magnetic field. (b) Top view of the loop. The forces \(\mathbf{F_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{F_{2}}\) acting on the arms AB and CD are indicated.

equilibrium is a stable one. Any small rotation of the coil produces a torque which brings it back to its original position. When they are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns itself with the external magnetic field.

If the loop has \(N\) closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq. (4.29), still holds, with

\[\mathbf{m}=NI\mathbf{A} \tag{4.30}\]

**Example 4.11** A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm carries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the coil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?

The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a horizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic field of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axis of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through an angle of 90\({}^{\circ}\) under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are the magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position? (d) What is the angular speed acquired by the coil when it has rotated by 90\({}^{\circ}\)? The moment of inertia of the coil is 0.1 kg m\({}^{2}\).

**Solution**

From Eq. (4.16)

\[B=\frac{\mu_{0}NI}{2R}\]

Here, \(N=100\); \(I=3.2\) A, and \(R=0.1\) m. Hence,

\[B=\frac{4\pi\times 10^{-7}\times 10^{2}\times 3.2}{2\times 10^{-1}}=\frac{4 \times 10^{-5}\times 10}{2\times 10^{-1}}\] (using \[\pi\times 3.2=10\] )

The direction is given by the right-hand thumb rule.

The magnetic moment is given by Eq. (4.30),

\[m=NI\,IA=NI\,I\,\pi^{2}=100\times 3.2\times 3.14\times 10^{-2}=10\text{ A m}^{2}\]

The direction is once again given by the right hand thumb rule.

\[\tau=|\mathbf{m}\times\mathbf{B}|\quad\text{[from Eq. \@@cite[cite]{[ \@@bibref{}{B2}{}{}]}]}\]

\[=m\,B\sin\theta\]

Initially, \(\theta=0\). Thus, initial torque \(\tau_{i}=0\). Finally, \(\theta=\pi/2\) (or 90\({}^{\circ}\)). Thus, final torque \(\tau_{j}=m\,B=10\times 2=20\text{ N m}\).

From Newton's second law,

\[\lambda\frac{\text{d}\omega}{\text{d}t}=m\,\,B\sin\theta\]

where \(\lambda\) is the moment of inertia of the coil. From chain rule,

\[\frac{\text{d}\omega}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}\omega}{\text{d}\theta}\frac {\text{d}\theta}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}\omega}{\text{d}\theta}\omega\]

Using this,

\[\lambda\omega\text{d}\omega=m\,B\sin\theta\text{d}\theta\]

**Example 4.12**:
1. A current-carrying circular loop lies on a smooth horizontal plane. Can a uniform magnetic field be set up in such a manner that the loop turns around itself (i.e., turns about the vertical axis).
2. A current-carrying circular loop is located in a uniform external magnetic field. If the loop is free to turn, what is its orientation of stable equilibrium? Show that in this orientation, the flux of the total field (external field + field produced by the loop) is maximum.
3. A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an external magnetic field. If the wire is flexible, why does it change to a circular shape?

**Solution**

1. No, because that would require \(\tau\) to be in the vertical direction. But \(\tau=I\,\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}\), and since \(\mathbf{A}\) of the horizontal loop is in the vertical direction, \(\tau\) would be in the plane of the loop for any \(\mathbf{B}\).
2. Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector \(\mathbf{A}\) of the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this orientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same direction as external field, both normal to the plane of the loop, thus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.
3. It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to maximize flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater area than any other shape.

#### Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole

In this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the current loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances) due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behavior to the electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.6, we have evaluated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius \(R\), carrying a steady current \(I\). The magnitude of this field is [Eq. (4.15)],

\[B=\frac{\mu_{0}I\,R^{2}}{2\left(x^{2}+R^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\]

and its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb rule (Fig. 4.12). Here, \(x\) is the distance along the axis from the centre of the loop. For \(x\)>> \(R\), we may drop the \(R^{2}\) term in the denominator. Thus,\(B=\frac{\mu_{0}R^{2}}{2x^{3}}\)

Note that the area of the loop \(A=\pi R^{2}\). Thus,

\(B=\frac{\mu_{0}IA}{2\pi x^{3}}\)

As earlier, we define the magnetic moment \(\mathbf{m}\) to have a magnitude \(IA\), \(\mathbf{m}=1IA\). Hence,

\(\mathbf{B}\simeq\frac{\mu_{0}\mathbf{m}}{2\,\pi\,x^{3}}\)

\(=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{2\mathbf{m}}{x^{3}}\) [4.31[a]]

The expression of Eq. [4.31[a]] is very similar to an expression obtained earlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if we substitute,

\(\mu_{0}\to 1/\,\varepsilon_{0}\)

\(\mathbf{m}\to\mathbf{p}_{e}\) (electrostatic dipole)

\(\mathbf{B}\to\mathbf{E}\) (electrostatic field)

We then obtain,

\(\mathbf{E}=\frac{2\mathbf{p}_{e}}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}\,x^{3}}\)

which is precisely the field for an electric dipole at a point on its axis. considered in Chapter 1, Section 1.10 [Eq. (1.20)].

It can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We had found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector of the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],

\(\mathbf{E}=\frac{\mathbf{p}_{e}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}x^{3}}\)

where \(x\)is the distance from the dipole. If we replace \(\mathbf{p}\to\mathbf{m}\) and \(\mu_{0}\to 1/\,\varepsilon_{0}\) in the above expression, we obtain the result for \(\mathbf{B}\) for a point \(n\)_the plane of the loop_ at a distance \(x\) from the centre. For \(x>>R\),

\(\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}}{x^{3}}\); [4.31[b]]

The results given by Eqs. [4.31(a)] and [4.31[b]] become exact for a _point_ magnetic dipole.

The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop: a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment \(\mathbf{m}=IA\), which is the analogue of electric dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}\). Note, however, a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary units -- the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic dipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent of electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.

We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see Fig. 4.12) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and (ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest that all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly true and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However, elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an _intrinsic_ magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.

#### 4.10.3 The magnetic dipole moment of a revolving electron

In Chapter 12 we shall read about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. You may perhaps have heard of this model which was proposed by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1911 and was a stepping stone to a new kind of mechanics, namely, quantum mechanics. In the Bohr model, the electron (a negatively charged particle) revolves around a positively charged nucleus much as a planet revolves around the sun. The force in the former case is electrostatic (Coulomb force) while it is gravitational for the planet-Sun case. We show this Bohr picture of the electron in Fig. 4.23.

The electron of charge (\(e\)) (\(e=+1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C) performs uniform circular motion around a stationary heavy nucleus of charge +_Ze_. This constitutes a current \(I\), where,

\[I=\frac{e}{T} \tag{4.32}\]

and \(T\) is the time period of revolution. Let \(r\) be the orbital radius of the electron, and \(v\) the orbital speed. Then,

\[T=\frac{2\pi r}{\upsilon} \tag{4.33}\]

Substituting in Eq. (4.32), we have \(I=ev/2\pi r\).

There will be a magnetic moment, usually denoted by \(\mu_{v}\) associated with this circulating current. From Eq. (4.28) its magnitude is, \(\mu_{i}=\hbar r^{2}=evr/2\).

The direction of this magnetic moment is into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.23. [This follows from the right-hand rule discussed earlier and the fact that the negatively charged electron is moving anti-clockwise, leading to a clockwise current.] Multiplying and dividing the right-hand side of the above expression by the electron mass \(m_{e}\), we have,

\[\mu_{i}=\frac{e}{2m_{e}}(m_{e}vr) \tag{4.34}\] \[=\frac{e}{2m_{e}}l \tag{4.34}\]

Here, \(l\) is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron about the central nucleus ("orbital" angular momentum). Vectorally,

\[\mathbf{\mu}_{i}=-\frac{e}{2m_{e}}\mathbf{1} \tag{4.34}\]

The negative sign indicates that the angular momentum of the electron is opposite in direction to the magnetic moment. Instead of electron with charge (-e), if we had taken a particle with charge (+q), the angular momentum and magnetic moment would be in the same direction. The ratio

\[\frac{\mu_{1}}{l}=\frac{e}{2m_{e}} \tag{4.35}\]

is called the _gyromagnetic ratio_ and is a constant. Its value is \(8.8\times 10^{10}\) C /kg for an electron, which has been verified by experiments.

The fact that even at an atomic level there is a magnetic moment, confirms Ampere's bold hypothesis of atomic magnetic moments. This according to Ampere, would help one to explain the magnetic properties of materials. Can one assign a value to this atomic dipole moment? The answer is Yes. One can do so within the Bohr model. Bohr hypothesised that the angular momentum assumes a discrete set of values, namely,

\[l=\frac{n\,h}{2\,\pi} \tag{4.36}\]

where \(n\) is a natural number, \(n=1\), \(2\), \(3\),.... and \(h\) is a constant named after Max Planck (Planck's constant) with a value \(h=6.626\times 10^{-34}\) J s. This condition of discreteness is called the _Bohr quantisation condition_. We shall discuss it in detail in Chapter 12. Our aim here is merely to use it to calculate the elementary dipole moment. Take the value \(n=1\), we have from Eq. (4.34) that,

\[\dot{(\mu_{1})}_{\min} =\frac{e}{4\,\pi\,m_{e}}\,h \tag{4.37}\] \[=\frac{1.60\times 10^{-19}\times 6.63\times 10^{-34}}{4\times 3.14 \times 9.11\times 10^{-31}}\] \[=9.27\times 10^{-24}\;\mathrm{Am}^{2}\]

where the subscript'min' stands for minimum. This value is called the _Bohr magneton_.

Any charge in uniform circular motion would have an associated magnetic moment given by an expression similar to Eq. (4.34). This dipole moment is labelled as the _orbital magnetic moment_. Hence the subscript 'I' in \(\mu_{r}\) Besides the orbital moment, the electron has an _intrinsic_ magnetic moment, which has the same numerical value as given in Eq. (4.37). It is called the _spin magnetic moment_. But we hasten to add that it is not as though the electron is spinning. The electron is an elementary particle and it does not have an axis to spin around like a top or our earth. Nevertheless it does possess this _intrinsic_ magnetic moment. The microscopic roots of magnetism in iron and other materials can be traced back to this intrinsic spin magnetic moment.

### The Moving Coil Galvanometer

Currents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in Chapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that current in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V? Figure 4.24 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the _moving__cold galvanometer_ (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.

The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate about a fixed axis (Fig. 4.24), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also increases the strength of the magnetic field. When a current flows through the coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be

\(\tau=NI\,AB\)

where the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by design, we have taken \(\sin\,\theta=1\) in the above expression for the torque. The magnetic torque \(NIAB\) tends to rotate the coil. A spring \(\mathrm{S_{p}}\) provides a counter torque \(k\phi\) that balances the magnetic torque \(NIAB\); resulting in a steady angular deflection \(\phi\). In equilibrium

\(k\phi=NI\,AB\)

where \(k\) is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque per unit twist. The deflection \(\phi\) is indicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the spring. We have

\[\phi=\left(\frac{NAB}{k}\right)I \tag{4.38}\]

The quantity in brackets is a constant for a given galvanometer.

The galvanometer can be used in a number of ways. It can be used as a detector to check if a current is flowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage in the Wheatstone's bridge arrangement. In this usage the neutral position of the pointer (when no current is flowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of the scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.24. Depending on the direction of the current, the pointer deflection is either to the right or the left.

The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for a current of the order of \(\mu\)A. (ii) For measuring currents, the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large resistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To overcome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance \(r_{s}\), called \(shunt\, resistance\), in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the current passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,

\(R_{o}\,r_{s}\,/\,(R_{o}\,+\,r_{s})\,\simeq\,r_{s}\,\) if \(R_{o}>>\,r_{s}\)

If \(r_{s}\) has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the circuit \(R_{c}\), the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small and negligible. This

Figure 4.24: The moving coil galvanometer. Its elements are described in the text. Depending on the requirement, this device can be used as a current detector or for measuring the value of the current (ammeter) or voltage (voltmeter).

arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.25. The scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value with ease. We define the _current sensitivity of the galvanometer as the deflection per unit current_. From Eq. (4.38) this current sensitivity is,

\[\frac{\phi}{I}=\frac{\text{NAB}}{k} \tag{4.39}\]

A convenient way for the manufacturer to increase the sensitivity is to increase the number of turns \(N\). We choose galvanometers having sensitivities of value, required by our experiment.

The galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the voltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected _in parallel_ with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original set up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the disturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent. To ensure this, a large resistance \(R\) is connected _in series_ with the galvanometer. This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.26. Note that the resistance of the voltmeter is now,

\[R_{\text{G}}+R^{\text{\text{\textminus}}}R:\text{ large}\]

The scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value with ease. We define the _voltage sensitivity as the deflection per unit voltage_. From Eq. (4.38),

\[\frac{\phi}{V}=\left(\frac{\text{NAB}}{k}\right)\frac{I}{V}=\left(\frac{\text {NAB}}{k}\right)\frac{1}{R} \tag{4.40}\]

An interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity may not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.39) which provides a measure of current sensitivity. If \(N\to 2N\), i.e., we double the number of turns, then

\[\frac{\phi}{I}\to 2\frac{\phi}{I}\]

Thus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the galvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length of the wire. In Eq. (4.40), \(N\to 2N\), and \(R\to 2R\), thus the voltage sensitivity,

\[\frac{\phi}{V}\to\frac{\phi}{V}\]

remains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion of a galvanometer to an ammeter will be different from what is needed for converting it into a voltmeter.

**Example 4.13**: In the circuit (Fig. 4.27) the current is to be measured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown (a) is a galvanometer with a resistance \(R_{\text{G}}=60.00\)\(\Omega\); (b) is a galvanometer described in (a) but converted to an ammeter by a shunt resistance \(r_{\text{s}}=0.02\)\(\Omega\); (c) is an ideal ammeter with zero resistance?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:573]

To obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression over the entire length of the conductor.
5. The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius \(R\) carrying a current \(I\) at an axial distance \(x\) from the centre is \(B=\frac{\mu_{0}\,R^{2}}{2(x^{2}+R^{2})^{3/2}}\) At the center this reduces to \(B=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{2R}\)
6. _Ampere's Circutal Law:_ Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop C. Then the Ampere's law states that \(\oint\limits_{C}\textbf{B-}d\textbf{l}=\mu_{0}I\) where \(I\) refers to the current passing through S. The sign of \(I\) is determined from the right-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If **B** is directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter \(L\) of a closed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then, \(BL=\mu_{0}\,I_{e}\) where \(I_{e}\) is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.
7. The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance \(R\) from a long, straight wire carrying a current \(I\) is given by: \(B=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\,\pi R}\) The field lines are circles concentric with the wire.
8. The magnitude of the field \(B\) inside a _long solenoid_ carrying a current \(I\) is \(B=\mu_{0}\,I\) where \(n\) is the number of turns per unit length. For a _toroid_ one obtains, \(B=\frac{\mu_{0}\,NI}{2\,\pi r}\) where \(N\) is the total number of turns and \(r\) is the average radius.
9. Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.
10. A planar loop carrying a current \(I\), having \(N\) closely wound turns, and an area \(A\) possesses a magnetic moment **m** where, \(\textbf{m}=N\,I\,\textbf{A}\) and the direction of **m** is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl the palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing in the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the direction of **m** (and **\(\Delta\)**) When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field **B**, the force **F** on it is: \(F=0\) And the torque on it is, \(\tau=\textbf{m}\,\textbf{x}\) In a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-torque due to a spring, yielding \(k\omega=NI\,AB\)where \(\phi\) is the equilibrium deflection and \(k\) the torsion constant of the spring.
* An electron moving around the central nucleus has a magnetic moment \(\mu_{\mathrm{i}}\) given by:. where \(l\) is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the circulating electron about the central nucleus. The smallest value of \(\mu_{\mathrm{i}}\) is called the Bohr magneton \(\mu_{\mathrm{{}_{B}}}\) and it is \(\mu_{\mathrm{{}_{B}}}=9.27\times 10^{-24}\) J/T
* A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by introducing a shunt resistance \(r_{\mathrm{{}_{S}}}\) of small value in parallel. It can be converted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value in series.

## 4 Points to Ponder

1. Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do not vary with time. When currents vary with time Newton's third law is valid only if momentum carried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account.
3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force, \(\mathbf{F}=q\left(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{E}\right)\) This velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the greatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous velocity \(\mathbf{v}\), the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the charged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an appropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the details of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this paradox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena (electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression _does not_ imply a universal preferred frame of reference in nature.
4. Ampere's Circuitat law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It can be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the Biot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss's law and Coulomb's law.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:576]

with the normal of the coil. Calculate the magnitude of the counter torque that must be applied to prevent the coil from turning.
2. Would your answer change, if the circular coil in (a) were replaced by a planar coil of some irregular shape that encloses the same area? (All other particulars are also unaltered.)

## 4 Additional exercises

Two concentric circular coils X and Y of radii 16 cm and 10 cm, respectively, lie in the same vertical plane containing the north to south direction. Coil X has 20 turns and carries a current of 16 A; coil Y has 25 turns and carries a current of 18 A. The sense of the current in X is anticlockwise, and clockwise in Y, for an observer looking at the coils facing west. Give the magnitude and direction of the net magnetic field due to the coils at their centre.

A magnetic field of 100 G (1 G = 10\({}^{-4}\) T) is required which is uniform in a region of linear dimension about 10 cm and area of cross-section about 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{2}\). The maximum current-carrying capacity of a given coil of wire is 15 A and the number of turns per unit length that can be wound round a core is at most 1000 turns m\({}^{-1}\). Suggest some appropriate design particulars of a solenoid for the required purpose. Assume the core is not ferromagnetic.

For a circular coil of radius \(R\) and \(N\) turns carrying current \(I\), the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on its axis at a distance \(x\) from its centre is given by,

\[B=\frac{\mu_{0}R^{2}N}{2\left(x^{2}+R^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\]

1. Show that this reduces to the familiar result for field at the centre of the coil.
2. Consider two parallel co-axial circular coils of equal radius \(R\), and number of turns \(N\), carrying equal currents in the same direction, and separated by a distance \(R\). Show that the field on the axis around the mid-point between the coils is uniform over a distance that is small as compared to \(R\), and is given by,

\[B=0.72\frac{\mu_{0}N}{R}\cdot\ \ \mbox{approximately}.\]

[Such an arrangement to produce a nearly uniform magnetic field over a small region is known as _Helmholtz coils_.]

A toroid has a core (non-ferromagnetic) of inner radius 25 cm and outer radius 26 cm, around which 3500 turns of a wire are wound. If the current in the wire is 11 A, what is the magnetic field (a) outside the toroid, (b) inside the core of the toroid, and (c) in the empty space surrounded by the toroid.

Answer the following questions:

1. A magnetic field that varies in magnitude from point to point but has a constant direction (east to west) is set up in a chamber. A charged particle enters the chamber and travels undeflected along a straight path with constant speed. What can you say about the initial velocity of the particle?
2. A charged particle enters an environment of a strong and non-uniform magnetic field varying from point to point both in magnitude and direction, and comes out of it following a complicated trajectory. Would its final speed equal the initial speed if it suffered no collisions with the environment?
3. An electron travelling west to east enters a chamber having a uniform electrostatic field in north to south direction. Specify the direction in which a uniform magnetic field should be set up to prevent the electron from deflecting from its straight line path.

Determine the trajectory of the electron if the field (a) is transverse to its initial velocity, (b) makes an angle of 30\({}^{\circ}\) with the initial velocity.
4.20 A magnetic field set up using Helmholtz coils (described in Exercise 4.16) is uniform in a small region and has a magnitude of 0.75 T. In the same region, a uniform electrostatic field is maintained in a direction normal to the common axis of the coils. A narrow beam of (single species) charged particles all accelerated through 15 kV enters this region in a direction perpendicular to both the axis of the coils and the electrostatic field. If the beam remains undeflected when the electrostatic field is 9.0 x 10\({}^{-5}\) V m\({}^{-1}\), make a simple guess as to what the beam contains. Why is the answer not unique?
4.21 A straight horizontal conducting rod of length 0.45 m and mass 60 g is suspended by two vertical wires at its ends. A current of 5.0 A is set up in the rod through the wires. 1. What magnetic field should be set up normal to the conductor in order that the tension in the wires is zero?
2. What will be the total tension in the wires if the direction of current is reversed keeping the magnetic field same as before? (Ignore the mass of the wires.) g = 9.8 m s\({}^{-2}\).
4.22 The wires which connect the battery of an automobile to its starting motor carry a current of 300 A (for a short time). What is the force per unit length between the wires if they are 70 cm long and 1.5 cm apart? Is the force attractive or repulsive?
4.23 A uniform magnetic field of 1.5 T exists in a cylindrical region of radius10.0 cm, its direction parallel to the axis along east to west. A wire carrying current of 7.0 A in the north to south direction passes through this region. What is the magnitude and direction of the force on the wire if, 1. the wire intersects the axis, 2. the wire is turned from N-S to northeast-northwest direction, 3. the wire in the N-S direction is lowered from the axis by a distance of 6.0 cm?
4.24 A uniform magnetic field of 3000 G is established along the positive z-direction. A rectangular loop of sides 10 cm and 5 cm carries a current of 12 A. What is the torque on the loop in the different cases shown in Fig. 4.28? What is the force on each case? Which case corresponds to stable equilibrium?

**(a)**: total torque on the coil,
**(b)**: total force on the coil.
**(c)**: average force on each electron in the coil due to the magnetic field?
**(The coil is made of copper wire of cross-sectional area 10**\({}^{\circ}\) **m**\({}^{2}\)**, and the free electron density in copper is given to be about 10**\({}^{29}\) **m**\({}^{-3}\)**.**
**4.26**: A solenoid 60 cm long and of radius 4.0 cm has 3 layers of windings of 300 turns each.

## Chapter Five Measurement and Matter

### 1 Introduction

Magnetic phenomena are universal in nature. Vast, distant galaxies, the tiny invisible atoms, men and beasts all are permeated through and through with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth's magnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called _magnesia_ where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island complained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed struck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This attractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.

The directional property of magnets was also known since ancient times. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in the north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed on a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name _lodestone_ (or _loadstone_) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-magnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this property is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400 BC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans crossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.

A Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti about four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whomnowadays you would call engineers). These 'engineers' built a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure with arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist's description of this chariot. The figure swweled around so that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed south. With this chariot, Huang-ti's troops were able to attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to defeat them.

In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others.

In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right.

Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:

1. The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north.
2. When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the _north pole_ and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the _south pole_ of the magnet.
3. There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two magnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of the other.
4. We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as _magnetic monopoles_ do not exist.
5. It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.

We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss's law of magnetism. We then follow it up with an account of the earth's magnetic field. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section on electromagnets and permanent magnets.

### The Bar Magnet

One of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert Einstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was fascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet could affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in any way _connected_ to it by a spring or string.

Figure 5.1: The arm of the statuette mounted on the chariot always points south. This is an artist’s sketch of one of the earliest known compasses, thousands of years old.

We begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.2.

The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles similar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As mentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the _North_ pole and the other, the _South_ pole. When suspended freely, these poles point approximately towards the geographic north and south poles, respectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current carrying solenoid.

#### 5.2.1 The magnetic field lines

The pattern of iron filings permits us to plot the magnetic field lines*. This is shown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in Fig. 5.3. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.17(d). Electric field lines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.3(c). The magnetic field lines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their properties are:

Footnote *: In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called _magnetic lines of force_. This nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostatics the field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a (moving) charge.

(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous closed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines begin from a positve charge and end on the negative charge or escape to infinity.

(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of the net magnetic field **B** at that point.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:583]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:584]

In magnitude \(\tau=mB\sin\theta\)

Here \(\tau\) is restoring torque and \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{m}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\).

Therefore, in equilibrium \(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}\dfrac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}}=-mB\sin\theta\)

Negative sign with \(mB\sin\theta\) implies that restoring torque is in opposition to deflecting torque. For small values of \(\theta\) in radians, we approximate \(\sin\theta=\theta\) and get

\[\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}\dfrac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}}=-mB\theta\]

or, \(\dfrac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}}=-\dfrac{mB}{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}}\theta\)

This represents a simple harmonic motion. The square of the angular frequency is \(\omega^{2}=mB/\beta\)and the time period is,

\[T=2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}}{mB}} \tag{5.4}\] \[\cdot\] \[\text{or}\quad\quad B=\dfrac{4\pi^{2}\,\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}} {m\,T^{2}} \tag{5.5}\]

An expression for magnetic potential energy can also be obtained on lines similar to electrostatic potential energy.

The magnetic potential energy \(U_{m}\) is given by

\[U_{m} =\int\tau\theta\theta\theta\] \[=\int mB\sin\theta\ =-mB\cos\theta\] \[=-\mathbf{m}\mathbf{-B} \tag{5.6}\]

We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy can be fixed at one's convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), i.e., when the needle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.6) shows that potential energy is minimum (\(=-mB\)) at \(\theta=0^{\circ}\) (most stable position) and maximum (\(=+mB\)) at \(\theta=180^{\circ}\) (most unstable position).

**Example 5.1** In Fig. 5.4(b), the magnetic needle has magnetic moment \(6.7\times 10^{-2}\) Am\({}^{2}\) and moment of inertia \(\neq 7.5\times 10^{-6}\) kg m\({}^{2}\). It performs 10 complete oscillations in 6.70 s. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field?

**Solution** The time period of oscillation is,

\[T=\dfrac{6.70}{10}=0.67\text{s}\]

From Eq. (5.5)

\[B=\dfrac{4\pi^{2}\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}}{m\,T}\]

\[=\dfrac{4\times(3.14)^{2}\times 7.5\times 10^{-6}}{6.7\times 10^{-2}\times(0.67 )^{2}}\]

\[=0.01\text{T}\]

**Example 5.2** A short bar magnet placed with its axis at 30\({}^{o}\) with an external field of 800 G experiences a torque of 0.016 Nm. [a] What is the magnetic moment of the magnet? (b) What is the work done in moving it from its most stable to most unstable position? (c) The bar magnet is replaced by a solenoid of cross-sectional area \(2\times 10^{-4}\) m\({}^{2}\) and 1000 turns, but of the same magnetic moment. Determine the current flowing through the solenoid.

**Solution**

1. From Eq. (5.3), \(\tau=m\) B sn \(\theta\), \(\theta=30^{o}\), hence sin\(\theta=1/2\). Thus, \(0.016=m\times(800\times 10^{-4}\) T) \(\times(1/2)\) \(m=160\times 2/800\) = 0.40 A m\({}^{2}\)
2. From Eq. (5.6), the most stable position is \(\theta=0^{o}\) and the most unstable position is \(\theta=180^{o}\). Work done is given by \(W=U_{m}(\theta=180^{o})-U_{m}(\theta=0^{o})\) \(=2\ m\) B = \(2\ m\) B = \(2\times 0.40\times 800\times 10^{-4}\) = 0.064 J
3. From Eq. (4.30), \(m_{y}=\)_NA_. From part (a), \(m_{y}=0.40\) A m\({}^{2}\) \(0.40=1000\times I\times 2\times 10^{-4}\) \(I=0.40\times 10^{4}/(1000\times 2)=2\)A

**Example 5.3**

1. What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (b) transverse to its length, (ii) along its length?
2. A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque but no net force. An iron nail near a bar magnet, however, experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?
3. Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south pole? What about the field due to a toroid?
4. Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.) How would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If only one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one? [Use nothing else but the bars A and B.]

**Solution**

1. In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south pole.
2. No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-uniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic moment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque. The net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north pole.
3. Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net non-zero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a straight infinite conductor.
4. Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in some situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends (poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to determine whether A or B is the magnet. In this case, to see whichone of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one, (say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of the other (say, B), and then on the middle of B. If you notice that in the middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised. If you do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.

#### 5.2.4 The electrostatic analog

Comparison of Eqs. (5.2), (5.3) and (5.6) with the corresponding equations for electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic field at large distances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment \(\mathbf{m}\) can be obtained from the equation for electric field due to an electric dipole of dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}\), by making the following replacements:

\[\mathbf{E}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}\,,\,\,\mathbf{p}\rightarrow\mathbf{m}\,,\,\, \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\rightarrow\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\]

In particular, we can write down the equatorial field (\(\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{g}}\)) of a bar magnet at a distance \(r\), for \(r>>l\), where \(l\) is the size of the magnet:

\[\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{g}}=-\frac{\mu_{0}\mathbf{m}}{4\,\pi\,r^{3}} \tag{5.7}\]

Likewise, the axial field (\(\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{g}}\)) of a bar magnet for \(r>>l\) is:

\[\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{g}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\,\pi}\frac{2\mathbf{m}}{r^{3}} \tag{5.8}\]

Equation (5.8) is just Eq. (5.2) in the vector form. Table 5.1 summarises the analogy between electric and magnetic dipoles.

**Example 5.5**: Figure 5.5 shows a small magnetised needle P placed at a point O. The arrow shows the direction of its magnetic moment. The other arrows show different positions (and orientations of the magnetic moment) of another identical magnetised needle Q.

In which configuration the system is not in equilibrium?

In which configuration is the system in (0) stable, and (ii) unstable equilibrium?

Which configuration corresponds to the lowest potential energy among all the configurations shown?

**Solution**

Potential energy of the configuration arises due to the potential energy of one dipole (say, Q) in the magnetic field due to other (P). Use the result that the field due to P is given by the expression [Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8)]:

\[\textbf{B}_{r}=-\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\textbf{m}_{r}}{r^{3}}\qquad\text{(on the normal bisector)}\]

\[\textbf{B}_{r}=\frac{\mu_{0}\textbf{2}}{4\pi}\frac{\textbf{m}_{r}}{r^{3}}\qquad \text{(on the axis)}\]

where \(\textbf{m}_{r}\) is the magnetic moment of the dipole P.

Equilibrium is stable when \(\textbf{m}_{0}\) is parallel to \(\textbf{B}_{p}\) and unstable when it is anti-parallel to \(\textbf{B}_{r}\).

For instance for the configuration Q\({}_{3}\) for which Q is along the perpendicular bisector of the dipole P, the magnetic moment of Q is parallel to the magnetic field at the position 3. Hence \(\textsf{Q}_{3}\) is stable.

Thus,

Magnetism and Gauss's Law

In Chapter 1, we studied Gauss's law for electrostatics. In Fig 5.3(c), we see that for a closed surface represented by 1, the number of lines leaving the surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent with the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in the same figure, for the closed surface 1, there is a net outward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.

The situation is radically different for magnetic fields which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by 1 or 4 in Fig 5.3(a) or Fig. 5.3(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it. The _net magnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces_. This is true for any closed surface.

Consider a small vector area element \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\) of a closed surface S as in Fig. 5.6. The magnetic flux through \(\mathbf{\hat{As}}\) is defined as \(\Delta\phi_{B}=\mathbf{B}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{S}\), where \(\mathbf{B}\) is the field at \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\). We divide \(\mathbf{S}\) into many small area elements and calculate the individual flux through each. Then, the net flux \(\phi_{B}\) is,

\[\dot{\phi}_{B}=\sum_{\text{all}}\Delta\phi_{B}=\sum_{\text{all}}\mathbf{B}\cdot \Delta\mathbf{S}=0 \tag{5.9}\]

where 'all' stands for 'all area elements \(\Delta\mathbf{S}\)'. Compare this with the Gauss's law of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface in that case is given by

\[\sum\mathbf{E}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{S}=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{0}}\]

where \(q\) is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.

The difference between the Gauss's law of magnetism and that for electrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also called monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks of \(\mathbf{B}\); the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of dipoles and/or current loops.

Thus, Gauss's law for magnetism is:

_The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero._

**Example 5.6**: Many of the diagrams given in Fig. 5.7 show magnetic field lines (thick lines in the figure) _wrongly_. Point out what is wrong with them. Some of them may describe electrostatic field lines correctly. Point out which ones.

Figure 5.6:

**Solution**

(a) _Wrong._ Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as shown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of **B** must always be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to enter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight conductor, as described in Chapter 4.

* _Wrong_. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross each other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure. Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space, nor when the loop encloses charges.
* _Right_. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid. Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings contains magnetic field.
* _Wrong_. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates Ampere's law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet eventually to form closed loops.
* _Right_. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note carefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.
* _Wrong_. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field. Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of the shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field. The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged lower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.7(e) and (f)] should be carefully grasped.
* _Wrong_. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable. Otherwise, Ampere's law is violated. This is also true for electric field lines.

**Example 5.7**:
* Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along which a small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic field lines also represent the _lines of force_ on a moving charged particle at every point?
* Magnetic field lines can be entirely confined within the core of a toroid, but not within a straight solenoid. Why?
* If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss's law of magnetism be modified?
* Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field? Does one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another element of the _same wire_?
* Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero? Solution
* No. The magnetic force is always normal to **B** (remember magnetic force = \(q\boldsymbol{\forall}\boldsymbol{\times}\textbf{B}\)). It is misleading to call _magnetic field lines_ as _lines of force_.

2. If field lines were entirely confined between two ends of a straight solenoid, the flux through the cross-section at each end would be non-zero. But the flux of field **B** through any closed surface must always be zero. For a toroid, this difficulty is absent because it has no 'ends'.
3. Gauss's law of magnetism states that the flux of **B** through any closed surface is always zero. If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the monopole (magnetic charge) enclosed by S. [Analogous to Gauss's law of electrostatics, \(\int_{S}\textbf{B}\cdot\textbf{ds}=\mu_{0}q_{m}\) where \(q_{m}\) is the (monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S.]
4. No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field produced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight wire, this force is zero.)
5. Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment through their net charge is zero.

### The Earth's Magnetism

Earlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of the earth's magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth's surface; its value being of the order of \(10^{-5}\,\mathrm{T}\).

What causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear. Originally the magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet placed approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in the interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The magnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced by convective motion of metallic fluids (consisting mostly of molten iron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the _dynamo effect_.

The magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical) magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole does not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently titled by approximately \(11.3^{\circ}\) with respect to the later. In this way of looking at it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to the dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole is at a latitude of \(79.74^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}\) and a longitude of \(71.8^{\circ}\,\mathrm{W}\), a place somewhere in north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at \(79.74^{\circ}\,\mathrm{S}\), \(108.22^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}\) in the Antarctica.

The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the _north magnetic pole_. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is calledthe _south magnetic pole_. There is some confusion in the nomenclature of the poles. If one looks at the magnetic field lines of the earth (Fig. 5.8), one sees that unlike in the case of a bar magnet, the field lines go into the earth at the north magnetic pole (\(N_{m}\)) and come out from the south magnetic pole (\(S_{m}\)). The convention arose because the magnetic north was the direction to which the north pole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of a magnet was so named as it was the _north seeking pole_. Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves like the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and vice versa.

#### 5.4.1 Magnetic declination and dip

Consider a point on the earth's surface. At such a point, the direction of the longitude circle determines the geographic north-south direction, the line of longitude towards the north pole being the direction of true north. The vertical plane containing the longitude circle and the axis of rotation of the earth is called the _geographic meridian_. In a similar way, one can define _magnetic meridian_ of a place as the vertical plane which passes through the imaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles. This plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a longitude like circle. A magnetic needle, which is free to swing horizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the north pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic north pole. Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled with respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic meridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian. This, then, is the angle between the true geographic north and the north shown by a compass needle. This angle is called the _magnetic declination_ or simply _declination_ (Fig. 5.9).

The declination is greater at higher latitudes and smaller near the equator. The declination in India is small, it being

Figure 5.9: A magnetic needle free to move in horizontal plane, points toward the magnetic north–south direction.

0\({}^{\circ}\)41' E at Delhi and 0\({}^{\circ}\)58' W at Mumbai. Thus, at both these places a magnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.

There is one more quantity of interest. If a magnetic needle is perfectly balanced about a horizontal axis so that it can swing in a plane of the magnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal (Fig. 10). This is known as the _angle of dip_ (also known as _inclination_). Thus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{E}}\) of the earth makes with the surface of the earth. Figure 11 shows the magnetic meridian plane at a point P on the surface of the earth. The plane is a section through the earth. The total magnetic field at P can be resolved into a horizontal component \(\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{E}}\) and a vertical component \(\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{E}}\). The angle that \(\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{E}}\) makes with \(\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{E}}\) is the angle of dip, \(L\).

In most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle tilts downwards. Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south pole of the dip needle tilts downwards.

To describe the magnetic field of the earth at a point on its surface, we need to specify three quantities, viz., the declination \(D\), the angle of dip or the inclination \(I\) and the horizontal component of the earth's field \(H_{\mathrm{E}}\). These are known as the _element of the earth's magnetic field_.

Representing the verticle component by \(Z_{\mathrm{E}}\), we have

\[Z_{\mathrm{E}}=B_{E}\sin I\] [5.10(a)] \[H_{\mathrm{E}}=B_{\mathrm{E}}\cos I\] [5.10(b)] which gives,

\[\tan I=\frac{Z_{\mathrm{E}}}{H_{\mathrm{E}}}\] [5.10(c)]A compass needle consists of a magnetic needle which floats on a pivotal point. When the compass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic meridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals which cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic declination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true north.

So what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic field lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible. If the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction, rendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a _dip needle_ which is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the earth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with the vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.

**Example 5.9**: In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field is 0.26G and the dip angle is 60\({}^{\circ}\). What is the magnetic field of the earth at this location?

**Solution**

It is given that \(H_{E}\) = 0.26 G. From Fig. 5.11, we have

\[\cos\theta 0^{\circ}=\frac{H_{E}}{B_{E}}\] \[B_{E}=\frac{H_{E}}{\cos 60^{\circ}}\] \[=\frac{0.26}{(1/2)}=0.52\,\mathrm{G}\]It must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is causing the earth's magnetic field. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth, it is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to the magnetic south pole. The earth's core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and nickel are responsible for earth's magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon, which has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a weaker magnetic field, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has a fairly strong magnetic field. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open questions which form an important area of continuing research.

The variation of the earth's magnetic field with position is also an interesting area of study. Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream called the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth's magnetic field, and in turn, they affect the pattern of the earth's magnetic field. The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is quite different from that in other regions of the earth.

The variation of earth's magnetic field with time is no less fascinating. There are short term variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a period of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records are available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 3.5\({}^{\circ}\), suggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale of a million years, the earth's magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction. Basalt contains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it align themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies. Geological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided evidence for the change of direction of earth's magnetic field, several times in the past.

### Magnetisation and Magnetic Intensity

The earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds. In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and even elements. One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these substances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms which will help us to carry out this exercise.

We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic moment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they can give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define _magnetation_**M** of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per unit volume:

\[\textbf{M}=\frac{\textbf{m}_{\textrm{\tiny{not}}}}{V} \tag{5.11}\]

**M** is a vector with dimensions L\({}^{\textrm{-1}}\) A and is measured in a units of A m\({}^{\textrm{-1}}\).

Consider a long solenoid of \(n\) turns per unit length and carrying a current \(I\). The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to be given by \[\mathbf{B}_{0}=\mu_{0}\,nl \tag{5.12}\]

If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero magnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\). The net \(\mathbf{B}\) field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as

\[\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{0}+\mathbf{B}_{m} \tag{5.13}\]

where \(\mathbf{B}_{m}\) is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that this additional field \(\mathbf{B}_{m}\) is proportional to the magnetisation \(\mathbf{M}\) of the material and is expressed as

\[\mathbf{B}_{m}=\mu_{0}\mathbf{M} \tag{5.14}\]

where \(\mu_{0}\) is the same constant (permeability of vacuum) that appears in Biot-Savart's law.

It is convenient to introduce another vector field \(\mathbf{H}\), called the _magnetic intensity_, which is defined by

\[\mathbf{H}=\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu_{0}}-\mathbf{M} \tag{5.15}\]

where \(\mathbf{H}\) has the same dimensions as \(\mathbf{M}\) and is measured in units of A m\({}^{-1}\). Thus, the total magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) is written as

\[\mathbf{B}=\mu_{0}\,(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M}) \tag{5.16}\]

We repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contribution to the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: _one_, due to external factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented by \(\mathbf{H}\). The _other_ is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material, namely \(\mathbf{M}\). The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This influence is mathematically expressed as

\[\mathbf{M}=\chi\,\mathbf{H} \tag{5.17}\]

where \(\chi\), a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the _magnetic susceptibility_. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an external field. Table 5.2 lists \(\chi\) for some elements. It is small and positive for materials, which are called _paramagnetic_. It is small and negative for materials, which are termed _diamagnetic_. In the latter case \(\mathbf{M}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) are opposite in direction. From Eqs. (5.16) and (5.17) we obtain,

\[\mathbf{B}=\mu_{0}(1+\chi)\mathbf{H} \tag{5.18}\]

\[=\mu_{0}\,\mu_{\tau}\,\mathbf{H} \tag{5.19}\]

where \(\mu_{\tau}=1+\chi\), is a dimensionless quantity called the _relative magnetic permeability_ of the substance. It is the analog of the dielectric constant in electrostatics. The _magnetic permeability_ of the substance is \(\mu\) and it has the same dimensions and units as \(\mu_{0}\):

\[\mu=\mu_{0}\mu_{\tau}=\mu_{0}\,(1+\chi).\]

The three quantities \(\chi\), \(\mu_{\tau}\) and \(\mu\) are interrelated and only one of them is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.

### Magnetic Properties of Materials

The discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility \(\chi\), a material is diamagnetic if \(\chi\) is negative, para- if \(\chi\) is positive and small, and ferro- if \(\chi\) is large and positive.

A glance at Table 5.3 gives one a better feeling for these materials. Here \(\varepsilon\) is a small positive number introduced to quantify paramagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some detail.

#### 5.6.1 Diamagnetism

Diamagnetic substances are those which have tendency to move from stronger to the weaker part of the external magnetic field. In other words, unlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel a diamagnetic substance.

Figure 5.12(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external magnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field inside the material is reduced. In most cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this reduction is slight, being one part in \(10^{5}\). When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.

The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum. These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus possess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic field is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the same direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up. This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz's law which you will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic moment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.

Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.

The most exotic diamagnetic materials are _superconductors_. These are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both _perfect conductivity_ and _perfect diamagnetism_. Here the field lines are completely expelled! \(\chi=-1\) and \(\mu_{r}=0\). A superconductor repels a magnet and (by Newton's third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors is called the _Meissner effect_, after the name of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains.

#### 5.6.2 Paramagnetism

Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen. In the presence of an external field \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\), which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\). Figure 5.12(b) shows a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In most cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this enhancement is slight, being one part in \(10^{5}\). When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field to strong.

Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. Experimentally, one finds that the magnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature \(T\),

\[M=C\frac{B_{0}}{T}\] [5.20(a)]

or equivalently, using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.17)

\[\chi=C\frac{\mu_{0}}{T}\] [5.20(b)]

This is known as _Curie's law_, after its discoverer Pierce Curie (1859-1906). The constant \(C\) is called _Curie's constant_. Thus, for a paramagnetic material both \(\chi\) and \(\mu_{r}\) depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value \(M_{\omega}\) at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field. Beyond this, Curie's law [Eq. (5.20)] is no longer valid.

#### Ferromagnetism

Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called _domain_. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a net magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains about \(10^{11}\) atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly from domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown in Fig. 5.13(a). When we apply an external magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\), the domains orient themselves in the direction of \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\) and simultaneously the domain oriented in the direction of \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\) grow in size. This existence of domains and their motion in \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\) are not speculations. One may observe this under a microscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered ferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be observed. Figure 12(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned and amalgamated to form a single 'giant' domain.

Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly concentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move towards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens when the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the magnetisation persists. Such materials are called _hard_ magnetic materials or _hard_ ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is another. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other things as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal of the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough, such materials are called _soft ferromagnetic materials_. There are a number of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, etc. The relative magnetic permeability is >10001

The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure disintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with temperature is gradual. It is a phase transition reminding us of the melting of a solid crystal. The temperature of transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetism is called the _Curte temperature_\(T_{c}\). Table 4 lists the Curie temperature of certain ferromagnets. The susceptibility above the Curie temperature, i.e., in the paramagnetic phase is described by,

\[\chi=\frac{C}{T-T_{c}}\quad(T>T_{c}) \tag{12}\]

**Example 5.11** A domain in ferromagnetic iron is in the form of a cube of side length 1\(\upmu\)m. Estimate the number of iron atoms in the domain and the maximum possible dipole moment and magnetisation of the domain. The molecular mass of iron is 55 g/mole and its density is 7.9 g/cm\({}^{3}\). Assume that each iron atom has a dipole moment of 9.27\(\times\)10\({}^{\text{-24}}\) A m\({}^{2}\).

The relation between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) in ferromagnetic materials is complex. It is often not linear and it depends on the magnetic history of the sample. Figure 14 depicts the behaviour of the material as we take it through one cycle of magnetisation. Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We place it in a solenoid and increase the current through the solenoid. The magnetic field \(B\) in the material rises and saturates as depicted in the curve \(\mathrm{Oa}\). This behaviour represents the alignment and merger of domains until no further enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase the current (and hence the magnetic intensity \(H\)) beyond this. Next, we decrease \(H\) and reduce it to zero. At \(H\) = 0, \(B\)\(\neq\) 0. This is represented by the curve \(\mathrm{ab}\). The value of \(B\) at \(H\) = 0 is called _reentativity_ or _remanence_. In Fig. 14, \(B_{h}\) = 1.2 T, where the subscript \(R\) denotes reentativity. The domains are not completely randomised even though the external driving field has been removed. Next, the current in the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased. Certain domains are flipped until the net field inside stands nullified. This is represented by the curve \(\mathrm{b}\). The value of \(H\) at \(c\) is called _coerctivity_. In Fig. 14\(H_{c}\) \(\sim\) -90 \(\mathrm{A}\) m\({}^{-1}\). As the reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once again obtain saturation. The curve \(\mathrm{cd}\) depicts this. The saturated magnetic field \(B_{s}\) \(\sim\) 1.5 T. Next, the current is reduced (curve \(\mathrm{de}\)) and reversed (curve \(\mathrm{ea}\)). The cycle repeats itself. Note that the curve \(\mathrm{Oa}\) does not retrace itself as \(H\) is reduced. For a given value of \(H\), \(B\) is not unique but depends on previous history of the sample. This phenomenon is called _hysterisis_. The word _hysterisis_ means _lagging behind_ (and not 'history').

### 5.7 Permanent Magnets and Electromagnets

Substances which at room temperature retain their ferromagnetic property for a long period of time are called _permanent magnets_. Permanent

Figure 14: The magnetic hysteresis loop is the B-H curve for ferromagnetic materials.

magnets can be made in a variety of ways. One can hold an iron rod in the north-south direction and hammer it repeatedly. The method is illustrated in Fig. 15. The illustration is from a 400 year old book to emphasise that the making of permanent magnets is an old _art_. One can also hold a steel rod and stroke it with one end of a bar magnet a large number of times, always in the same sense to make a permanent magnet.

An efficient way to make a permanent magnet is to place a ferromagnetic rod in a solenoid and pass a current. The magnetic field of the solenoid magneties the rod.

The hysteresis curve (Fig. 14) allows us to select suitable materials for permanent magnets. The material should have high retentivity so that the magnet is strong and high coercivity so that the magnetisation is not erased by stray magnetic fields, temperature fluctuations or minor mechanical damage. Further, the material should have a high permeability. Steel is one-favoured choice. It has a slightly smaller retentivity than soft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity of soft iron. Other suitable materials for permanent magnets are alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal.

Core of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials which have high permeability and low retentivity. Soft iron is a suitable material for electromagnets. On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and passing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a thousand fold. When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is effectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 16.

In certain applications, the material goes through an ac cycle of magnetisation for a long period. This is the case in transformer cores and telephone diaphragms. The hysteresis curve of such materials must be narrow. The energy dissipated and the heating will consequently be small. The material must have a high resistivity to lower eddy current losses. You will study about eddy currents in Chapter 6.

Electromagnets are used in electric bells, loudspeakers and telephone diaphragms. Giant electromagnets are used in cranes to lift machinery, and bulk quantities of iron and steel.

Figure 16: A soft iron core in solenoid acts as an electromagnet.

Figure 15: A blacksmith forging a permanent magnet by striking a red-hot rod of iron kept in the north-south direction with a hammer. The sketch is recreated from an illustration in De Magnete, a work published in 1600 and authored by William Gilbert, the court physician to Queen Elizabeth of England.

Because of its practical application in prospecting, communication, and navigation, the magnetic field of the earth is mapped by most nations with an accuracy comparable to geographical mapping. In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from Trivandrum (now Thrivuvananthapuram) in the south to Gulmarg in the north. These observatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), in Colaba, Mumbai. The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally established in 1971. The IIG monitors (via its nation-wide observatories), the geomagnetic fields and fluctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space. Its services are used by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a part of the world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data. Now India has a permanent station called Gangotti.

## Summary

* The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient times that magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like magnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet in two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.
* When a bar magnet of dipole moment **m*
* is placed in a uniform magnetic field **B**.
* the force on it is zero,
* the torque on it is **m**x**B**,
* its potential energy is **-m**-**B**, where we choose the zero of energy at the orientation when **m*
* is perpendicular to **B**.
* Consider a bar magnet of size **l*
* and magnetic moment **m**, at a distance \(r\) from its mid-point, where _r_>>_l_, the magnetic field **B*
* due to this bar is,
* Gauss's law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero
* The earth's magnetic field resembles that of a (hypothetical) magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north magnetic pole. Similarly, the pole near the geographic south pole is called the south magnetic pole. This dipole is aligned making a small angle with the rotation axis of the earth. The magnitude of the field on the earth's surface \(\approx 4\times 10^{-5}\) T.
Three quantities are needed to specify the magnetic field of the earth on its surface - the horizontal component, the magnetic declination, and the magnetic dip. These are known as the elements of the earth's magnetic field.
7. Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}_{0}\). The magnetic intensity is defined as, \(\mathbf{H}=\frac{\mathbf{B}_{0}}{\mu_{0}}\) The magnetisation \(\mathbf{M}\) of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume. The magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) in the material is, \(\mathbf{B}=\mu_{0}\) (\(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M}\))
8. For a linear material \(\mathbf{M}=\chi\,\mathbf{H}\). So that \(\mathbf{B}=\mu\,\mathbf{H}\) and \(\chi\) is called the magnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, \(\chi\), the relative magnetic permeability \(\mu_{r}\), and the magnetic permeability \(\mu\) are related as follows: \(\mu=\mu_{0}\,\mu_{r}\) \(\mu_{r}=1+\chi\)
9. Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials \(\chi\) is negative and small and for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagnetic materials have large \(\chi\) and are characterised by non-linear relation between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\). They show the property of hysteresis.
10. Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic property for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.

Points to Ponder

1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving charges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science and engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in tandem.
2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the electronic charge with value \(\left|\,e\right|=1.6\times\)10-19 C. All other charges are integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why electric charge is quantised.
3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).
4. The earth's magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The earth's core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core are responsible for the earth's magnetic field. As to what 'dynamo' effect sustains this current, and why the earth's field reverses polarity every million years or so, we do not know.
5. A minuscule difference in the value of \(\chi\). the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials \(\chi=-10^{-5}\) whereas \(\chi=+10^{-5}\) for paramagnetic materials.
6. There exists _a perfect diamagnet_, namely, a superconductor. This is a metal at very low temperatures. In this case \(\chi=-1\). \(\mu=0\), \(\mu=0\). The external magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is also a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which ties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The BCS theory was proposed in 1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel Prize in physics in 1970.
7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar behaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain may not be proportional to stress; here \(H\) and \(B\) (or \(M\)) are not linearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and area enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume. A similar interpretation can be given to the \(B\)-\(H\) magnetic hysteresis curve.
8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it is weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.
9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material such as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties which are exotic and mysterious.

## Chapter Six Electromagnetic Induction

### 6.1 Introduction

Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated phenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example, an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity. This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible? Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit such a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is resounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when subjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand the underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called _electromagnetic induction_.

When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion between a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the latter, he was asked, "What is the use of it?" His reply was: "What is the use of a new born baby?" The phenomenon of electromagnetic inductionis not merely of theoretical or academic interest but also of practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no electricity - no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and no personal computers. The pioneering experiments of Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development of modern day generators and transformers. Today's civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the discovery of electromagnetic induction.

### The Experiments of Faraday and Henry

The discovery and understanding of electromagnetic induction are based on a long series of experiments carried out by Faraday and Henry. We shall now describe some of these experiments.

**Experiment 6.1**:

Figure 6.1 shows a coil C\({}_{1}\)* connected to a galvanometer G. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects, indicating the presence of electric current in the coil. The deflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion. The galvanometer does not show any deflection when the magnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the current's direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite to that observed with the North-pole for similar movements. Further, the deflection (and hence current) is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed towards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead, when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C\({}_{1}\) is moved towards or away from the magnet, the same effects are observed. It shows that _it is the relative motion between the magnet and the coil that is responsible for generation (induction) of electric current in the coil._

**Experiment 6.2**:

In Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil C\({}_{2}\) connected to a battery. The steady current in the coil C\({}_{2}\) produces a steady magnetic field. As coil C\({}_{2}\) is

Figure 6.1: When the bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer G deflects.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:613]

a plane of area \(A\) placed in a uniform magnetic field **B** (Fig. 6.4) can be written as

\[\Phi_{{}_{B}}=\textbf{B}\cdot\textbf{A}=BA\cos\theta \tag{6.1}\]

where \(\theta\) is angle between **B** and **A**. The notion of the area as a vector has been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be extended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.

If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at various parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic flux through the surface is given by

\[\dot{\phi}_{{}_{B}}=\textbf{B},\cdot\textbf{dA}_{{}_{1}}+\textbf{B}_{{}_{2}} \cdot\textbf{dA}_{{}_{1}}+...=\sum_{\text{all}}\textbf{B}_{{}_{1}}\cdot\textbf{ dA}_{{}_{1}} \tag{6.2}\]

where 'all' stands for summation over all the area elements \(\textbf{dA}_{{}_{1}}\) comprising the surface and \(\textbf{B}_{{}_{1}}\)is the magnetic field at the area element \(\textbf{dA}_{{}_{1}}\). The SI unit of magnetic flux is weaker (Wb) or tesla meter squared (\(\Gamma\) m\({}^{2}\)). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.

### Faraday's Law of Induction

From the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a conclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux through the coil changes with time. Experimental observations discussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.

The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) in Experiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C\({}_{{}_{2}}\) towards or away from coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic flux associated with coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\). The change in magnetic flux induces emf in coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\). It was this induced emf which caused electric current to flow in coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) and through the galvanometer. A plausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is as follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in coil C\({}_{{}_{2}}\) (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a maximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic flux through the neighbouring coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) also increases. It is the change in magnetic flux through coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) that produces an induced emf in coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\). When the key is held pressed, current in coil C\({}_{{}_{2}}\) is constant. Therefore, there is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) and the current in coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C\({}_{{}_{2}}\) and the resulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a short time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\) and hence again induces an electric current in coil C\({}_{{}_{1}}\). The common point in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic flux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental observations in the form of a law called _Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction_. The law is stated below.

The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit._

Mathematically, the induced emf is given by

\[\varepsilon=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\,\Phi_{\mathrm{b}}}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{6.3}\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of \(\varepsilon\) and hence the direction of current in a closed loop. This will be discussed in detail in the next section.

In the case of a closely wound coil of \(N\,\mathrm{turns}\), change of flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore, the expression for the total induced emf is given by

\[\varepsilon=-N\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\,\Phi_{\mathrm{b}}}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{6.4}\]

The induced emf can be increased by increasing the network of turns \(N\,\mathrm{of}\) a closed coil.

From Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be varied by changing any one or more of the terms \(\mathbf{B}\), \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\theta\). In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is changed by varying \(\mathbf{B}\). The flux can also be altered by changing the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or stretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a magnetic field such that the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{A}\) changes. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the respective coils.

**Example 6.1**: Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain a large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate the presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?
**Solution**

1. To obtain a large deflection, one or more of the following steps can be taken: (i) Use a rod made of soft iron inside the coil \(\mathrm{C}_{2}\), (ii) Connect the coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) Move the arrangement rapidly towards the test coil \(C_{1}\).
2. Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in a small torch light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause the bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced current.

In experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faraday who is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever, was legendary for his innovative skills.

**Example 6.2**: A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 \(\Omega\) is placed vertically in the east-west plane. A uniform magnetic field of 0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The magnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determine the magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:616]

### 6.5 Lenz's Law and Conservation of Energy

In 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduced a rule, known as _Lenz's law_ which gives the polarity of the induced emf in a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:

_The polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it._

The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can understand Lenz's law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed towards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux. This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet. Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux, the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in flux.

What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop in the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open ends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found using Lenz's law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier way to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the direction shown by \(\vec{\lambda}\vec{\nabla}\) and \(\vec{\nabla}\) indicate the directions of the induced currents.

A little reflection on this matter should convince us on the correctness of Lenz's law. Suppose that the induced current was in the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case, the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching North-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy will continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a suitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy and hence can not happen.

Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation, the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced current. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.

Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.

**Example 6.4**: Figure 6.7 shows planar loops of different shapes moving out of or into a region of a magnetic field which is directed normal to the plane of the loop away from the reader. Determine the direction of induced current in each loop using Lenz's law.

**Solution**

(i) The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases, due to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The induced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes the increasing flux. (ii) Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular loop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along bacb, so as to oppose the change in flux. (iii) As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular shaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced current flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.

Note that there are no induced current as long as the loops are completely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.

**Example 6.5**: (a) A closed loop is held stationary in the magnetic field between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets held fixed. Can we hope to generate current in the loop by using very strong magnets? (b) A closed loop moves normal to the constant electric field between the plates of a large capacitor. Is a current induced in the loop (i) when it is wholly inside the region between the capacitor plates (ii) when it is partially outside the plates of the capacitor? The electric field is normal to the plane of the loop. (c) A rectangular loop and a circular loop are moving out of a uniform magnetic field region (Fig. 6.8) to a field-free region with a _constant velocity_**v**. In which loop do you expect the induced emf to be constant _during_ the passage out of the field region? The field is normal to the loops.

### 6.6 Motional Electroromotive Force

Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-independent magnetic field. Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor PQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved towards the left with a constant velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) as shown in the figure. Assume that there is no loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a closed circuit enclosing an area that changes as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\) which is perpendicular to the plane of this system. If the length \(\mathrm{R}\mathrm{g}=x\) and \(\mathrm{R}\mathrm{S}=l\), the magnetic flux \(\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}\) enclosed by the loop PQRS will be

\[\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}=B\mathrm{l}x\]

Since \(x\mathrm{is}\) changing with time, the rate of change of flux \(\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}\) will induce an emf given by:

\[\varepsilon = \frac{-\mathrm{d}\,\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\,\frac{ \mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(B\mathrm{l}x\right) \tag{6.5}\] \[= -B\mathrm{l}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=B\mathrm{l}v\]

Figure 6.10: The arm PQ is moved to the left side, thus decreasing the area of the rectangular loop. This movement induces a current \(I\) as shown.

where we have used \(\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}t=-v\) which is the speed of the conductor PQ. The induced emf \(B\!u\) is called _motional emf_. Thus, we are able to produce induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field, that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.

It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5) by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge \(q\) in the conductor PQ. When the rod moves with speed \(v\), the charge will also be moving with speed \(v\) in the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\). The Lorentz force on this charge is \(q\!uB\) in magnitude, and its direction is towards \(\mathbf{Q}\). All charges experience the same force, in magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.

The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,

\[\mathrm{W}=q\!uB\!l\]

Since emf is the work done per unit charge,

\[\dot{\varepsilon}=\frac{W}{q}\]

\[=B\!u\]

This equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical to Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday's law when the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent magnetic field.

On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing - a fact which Faraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary conductor, the force on its charges is given by

\[\mathbf{F}=q\left(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{\nu}\times\mathbf{B}\right)=q\mathbf{E} \tag{6.6}\]

since \(\mathbf{\nu}=0\). Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric field term \(\mathbf{E}\) alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field generates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields produced by static electric charges have properties different from those produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that charges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet. Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the fundamental significance of the Faraday's discovery. Electricity and magnetism are related.

A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated with a frequency of 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the circumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis passing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring (Fig. 6.11). A constant and uniform magnetic field of 1 T parallel to the axis is present everywhere. What is the emf between the centre and the metallic ring?

**Solution**

_Method I_

As the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer end due to Lorentz force and get distrbuted over the ring. Thus, the resulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of the rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons and a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the emf generated across a length \(\mathrm{d}r\) of the rod as it moves at right angles to the magnetic field is given by

\(\mathrm{d}\epsilon=B\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro d}r\). Hence,

\(\epsilon=\int\mathrm{d}\epsilon=\int\limits_{0}^{R}B\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro d }r\)\(=\int\limits_{0}^{R}B\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro d}r\)\(=\frac{B\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro oR^{2}}}{2}\)

Note that we have used \(v=\omega\)\(r\). This gives

\(\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}\times 1.0\times 2\pi\times 50\times(1^{2})\)

= 157 V

_Method II_

To calculate the emf, we can imagine a closed loop OPQ in which point O and P are connected with a resistor \(R\) and OQ is the rotating rod. The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the induced emf and equals \(B\times\)(rate of change of area of loop). If \(\theta\) is the angle between the rod and the radius of the circle at P at time \(t\), the area of the sector OPQ is given by

\(\pi R^{2}\times\frac{\theta}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2}R^{2}\theta\)

where the radius of the circle. Hence, the induced emf is

\(\epsilon=B\times\frac{\mathrm{d}\epsilon}{\mathrm{d}t}\bigg{[}\frac{1}{2}R^{ 2}\theta\bigg{]}=\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{ B\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro d}\theta}{2}\)

[Note: \(\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}=\omega=2\pi\,\nu\)]

This expression is identical to the expression obtained by Method I and we get the same value of \(\epsilon\).

**Example 6.7**: A wheel with 10 metallic spokes each 0.5 m long is rotated with a speed of 120 rev/min in a plane normal to the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field \(H_{\mathrm{z}}\) at a place. If \(H_{\mathrm{z}}=0.4\) G at the place, what is the induced emf between the axle and the rim of the wheel? Note that 1 G = \(10^{-4}\)T.
**Solution**

Induced emf = (1/2) \(\omega\,B\,R^{2}\)

\(=(1/2)\times 4\pi\times 0.4\times 10^{-4}\times(0.5)^{2}\)

\(=6.28\times 10^{-5}\)V

The number of spokes is immaterial because the emf's across the spokes are _tn parallel_.

### Energy Consideration: A Quantitative Study

In Section 6.5, we discussed qualitatively that Lenz's law is consistent with the law of conservation of energy. Now we shall explore this aspect further with a concrete example.

Let \(r\) be the resistance of movable arm PQ of the rectangular conductor shown in Fig. 6.10. We assume that the remaining arms QR, RS and SP have negligible resistances compared to \(r\). Thus, the overall resistance of the rectangular loop is \(r\) and this does not change as PQ is moved. The current \(I\) in the loop is,

\[I = \frac{\varepsilon}{r} \tag{6.7}\] \[= \frac{Blv}{r}\]

On account of the presence of the magnetic field, there will be a force on the arm PQ. This force \(I(\mathbf{l}\times\mathbf{B})\), is directed outwards in the direction opposite to the velocity of the rod. The magnitude of this force is,

\[F = I\,IB=\frac{B^{2}l^{2}v}{r}\]

where we have used Eq. (6.7). Note that this force arises due to drift velocity of charges (responsible for current) along the rod and the consequent Lorentz force acting on them.

Alternatively, the arm PQ is being pushed with a constant speed \(v\), the power required to do this is,

\[P = F\,v \tag{6.8}\] \[= \frac{B^{2}l^{2}v^{2}}{r}\]

The agent that does this work is mechanical. Where does this mechanical energy go? The answer is: it is dissipated as Joule heat, and is given by

\[P_{J} = I^{2}r = \left(\frac{Blv}{r}\right)^{2}r=\frac{B^{2}l^{2}v^{2}}{r}\]

which is identical to Eq. (6.8).

Thus, mechanical energy which was needed to move the arm PQ is converted into electrical energy (the induced emf) and then to thermal energy.

There is an interesting relationship between the charge flow through the circuit and the change in the magnetic flux. From Faraday's law, we have learnt that the magnitude of the induced emf is,

\(\cdot\)

\(\left|e\right|=\frac{\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h}}}{\Delta t}\)

However,

\(\cdot\)

\(\left|e\right|=Ir=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}r\)

Thus,

\(\Delta\theta=\frac{\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h}}}{r}\)

**Example 6.8**: Refer to Fig. 6.12(a). The arm PQ of the rectangular conductor is moved from \(x=0\), outwards. The uniform magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane and extends from \(x=0\) to \(x=b\) and is zero for \(x>b\). Only the arm PQ possesses substantial resistance \(r\). Consider the situation when the arm PQ is pulled outwards from \(x=0\) to \(x=2b\), and is then moved back to \(x=0\) with constant speed \(v\). Obtain expressions for the flux, the induced emf, the force necessary to pull the arm and the power dissipated as Joule heat. Sketch the variation of these quantities with distance.

**Solution**: Let us first consider the forward motion from \(x=0\) to \(x=2b\) The flux \(\Phi_{\mathrm{h}}\) linked with the circuit SPQR is

\(\Phi_{\mathrm{h}}=Blx\)\(\mathbf{0}\leq x<b\)

\(=Blb\)\(\mathbf{b}\leq x<2b\)

The induced emf is,

\(\epsilon=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_{\mathrm{h}}}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

\(=-B\mathrm{t}b\)\(\mathbf{0}\leq x<b\)

\(=\mathbf{0}\)\(\mathbf{b}\leq x<2b\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:624]

### Eddy Currents

So far we have studied the electric currents induced in well defined paths in conductors like circular loops. Even when bulk pieces of conductors are subjected to changing magnetic flux, induced currents are produced in them. However, their flow patterns resemble swirling eddies in water. This effect was discovered by physicist Foucault (1819-1868) and these currents are called _eddy currents_.

Consider the apparatus shown in Fig. 13. A copper plate is allowed to swing like a simple pendulum between the pole pieces of a strong magnet. It is found that the motion is damped and in a little while the plate comes to a halt in the magnetic field. We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of electromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux associated with the plate keeps on changing as the plate moves in and out of the region between magnetic poles. The flux change induces eddy currents in the plate. Directions of eddy currents are opposite when the plate swings into the region between the poles and when it swings out of the region.

If rectangular slots are made in the copper plate as shown in Fig. 14, area available to the flow of eddy currents is less. Thus, the pendulum plate with holes or slots reduces electromagnetic damping and the plate swings more freely. Note that magnetic moments of the induced currents (which oppose the motion) depend upon the area enclosed by the currents (recall equation **m** = _IA_ in Chapter 4).

This fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic cores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in which a coil is to be wound over metallic core. Eddy currents are undesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical energy in the form of heat. Eddy currents are minimised by using laminations of metal to make a metal core. The laminations are separated by an insulating material like lacquer. The plane of the laminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so that they cut across the eddy current paths. This arrangement reduces the strength of the eddy currents. Since the dissipation of electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength of electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced.

Eddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like:

**(i)**: _Magnetic braking in trains_: Strong electromagnets are situated above the rails in some electrically powered trains. When the electromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the rails oppose the motion of the train. As there are no mechanical linkages, the braking effect is smooth.
**(ii)**: _Electromagnetic damping_: Certain galvanometers have a fixed core made of nonmagnetic metallic material. When the coil oscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the motion and bring the coil to rest quickly.

Figure 14: Cutting slots in the copper plate reduces the effect of eddy currents.

Figure 13: Eddy currents are generated in the copper plate, while entering and leaving the region of magnetic field.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:626]

and intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which for a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation (geometry) and the dielectric constant \(K\) of the intervening medium (intrinsic material property).

Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [ML\({}^{2}\)T-\({}^{2}\)A-\({}^{2}\)] given by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The SI unit of inductance is _herry_ and is denoted by H. It is named in honour of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA, independently of Faraday in England.

#### 6.9.1 Mutual inductance

Consider Fig. 6.15 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length \(L\). We denote the radius of the inner solenoid \(S_{1}\) by \(r_{1}\) and the number of turns per unit length by \(n_{1}\). The corresponding quantities for the outer solenoid \(S_{2}\) are \(r_{2}\) and \(n_{2}\), respectively. Let \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) be the total number of turns of coils \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\), respectively.

When a current \(I_{2}\) is set up through \(S_{2}\), it in turn sets up a magnetic flux through \(S_{1}\). Let us denote it by \(\Phi_{1}\). The corresponding flux linkage with solenoid \(S_{1}\) is

\[N_{1}\,\Phi_{1}=M_{12}I_{2} \tag{6.9}\]

\(M_{12}\) is called the _mutual inductance_ of solenoid \(S_{1}\) with respect to solenoid \(S_{2}\). It is also referred to as the _coefficient of mutual induction_.

For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate \(M_{12}\). The magnetic field due to the current \(I_{2}\) in \(S_{2}\) is \(\mu_{0}n_{2}I_{2}\). The resulting flux linkage with coil \(S_{1}\) is,

\[N_{1}\,\Phi_{1}=\left(n_{1}l\right)\left(\pi r_{1}^{2}\right)\left(\mu_{0}n_{2 }I_{2}\right)\]

\[=\mu_{0}n_{1}n_{2}\pi r_{1}^{2}l_{2} \tag{6.10}\]

where \(n_{1}l\) is the total number of turns in solenoid \(S_{1}\). Thus, from Eq. (6.9) and Eq. (6.10),

\[M_{12}=\mu_{0}n_{1}n_{2}\pi r_{1}^{2}l \tag{6.11}\]

Note that we neglected the edge effects and considered the magnetic field \(\mu_{0}n_{2}I_{2}\) to be uniform throughout the length and width of the solenoid \(S_{2}\). This is a good approximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long, implying \(l\,>>\,r_{2}\).

We now consider the reverse case. A current \(I_{1}\) is passed through the solenoid \(S_{1}\) and the flux linkage with coil \(S_{2}\) is,

\[N_{2}\,\Phi_{2}=M_{21}\ I_{1} \tag{6.12}\]

\(M_{21}\) is called the _mutual inductance_ of solenoid \(S_{2}\) with respect to solenoid \(S_{1}\).

The flux due to the current \(I_{1}\) in \(S_{1}\) can be assumed to be confined solely inside \(S_{1}\) since the solenoids are very long. Thus, flux linkage with solenoid \(S_{2}\) is

\[N_{2}\,\Phi_{2}=\left(n_{2}l\right)\left(\pi r_{1}^{2}\right)\left(\mu_{0}n_{1 }I_{1}\right)\]where \(n_{2}l\) is the total number of turns of \(\mathrm{S}_{2}\). From Eq. (6.12),

\[M_{21}=\mu_{0}n_{1}n_{2}\pi r_{1}^{2}l \tag{6.13}\]

Using Eq. (6.11) and Eq. (6.12), we get

\[M_{12}=M_{21}=M\,\mathrm{(say)} \tag{6.14}\]

We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids. However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid was much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then we could still have calculated the flux linkage \(N_{1}\Phi_{1}\) because the inner solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the outer solenoid. In this case, the calculation of \(M_{12}\) would be easy. However, it would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer solenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the calculation of \(M_{21}\) would also be extremely difficult in this case. The equality \(M_{12}\)=\(M_{21}\) is very useful in such situations.

We explained the above example with air as the medium within the solenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability \(\mu_{r}\) had been present, the mutual inductance would be

\[M=\mu_{r}\mu_{0}\,n_{1}n_{2}\pi\,r_{1}^{2}\,l\]

It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of coils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative orientation.

**Example 6.9** Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius \(r_{1}\) and the other of large radius \(r_{2}\), such that \(r_{1}<<r_{2}\), are placed co-axially with centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the arrangement.

**Solution** Let a current \(I_{2}\) flow through the outer circular coil. The field at the centre of the coil is \(B_{2}=\mu_{0}I_{2}\) / \(2r_{2}\). Since the other co-axially placed coil has a very small radius, \(B_{2}\) may be considered constant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,

\[\Phi_{1}=\pi r_{1}^{2}B_{2}\]

\[=\frac{\mu_{0}\pi r_{1}^{2}}{2r_{2}}I_{2}\]

\[=M_{12}I_{2}\]

Thus,

\[M_{12}=\frac{\mu_{0}\pi r_{1}^{2}}{2r_{2}}\]

From Eq. (6.14)

\[M_{12}=M_{21}=\frac{\mu_{0}\,\pi r_{1}^{2}}{2r_{2}}\]

Note that we calculated \(M_{12}\) from an approximate value of \(\Phi_{1}\), assuming the magnetic field \(B_{2}\) to be uniform over the area \(\pi\)\(r_{1}^{2}\). However, we can accept this value because \(r_{1}<<r_{2}\).

Now, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment, emf is induced in coil \(C_{1}\) wherever there was any change in current through coil \(C_{2}\). Let \(\Phi_{1}\) be the flux through coil \(C_{1}\) (say of \(N_{1}\) turns) when current in coil \(C_{2}\) is \(L_{2}\).

Then, from Eq. (6.9), we have

\(N_{1}\Phi_{1}=M_{2}\)

For currents varrying with time,

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}\left(N_{1}\Phi_{1}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\mathrm{d} \left(M_{2}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

Since induced emf in coil \(C_{1}\) is given by

\(\varepsilon_{i}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\left(N_{1}\Phi_{1}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

We get,

\(\varepsilon_{i}=-M\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring coil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change of current and mutual inductance of the two coils.

#### 6.9.2 Self-inductance

In the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due to the current in the other. It is also possible that emf is induced in a single isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called _self-induction_. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of \(N\) turns is proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as

\(N\Phi_{B}\propto I\)

\(M\Phi_{B}=LI\)

where constant of proportionality \(L\) is called _self-inductance_ of the coil. It is also called the _coefficient of self-induction_ of the coil. When the current is varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Using Eq. (6.15), the induced emf is given by

\(\varepsilon=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\left(N\Phi_{B}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

\(\cdot\)

\(\varepsilon=-L\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change (increase or decrease) of current in the coil.

It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple geometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-sectional area \(A\) and length \(l\), having \(n\) turns per unit length. The magnetic field due to a current \(l\) flowing in the solenoid is \(B=\mu_{0}\,n\,I\) (neglecting edge effects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is

\(N\Phi_{B}=(nl)(\mu_{0}n\,I)(A)\)\(\cdot\)

\(=\mu_{0}n^{2}AlI\)

where \(nl\) is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,

\(\cdot\)

\(L=\frac{N\omega_{n}}{I}\)

\(=\mu_{0}n^{2}Al\)

If we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability \(\mu_{r}\) (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permiability), then,

\(\cdot\)

\(L=\mu\), \(\mu_{0}\,n^{2}Al\)

The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the permeability of the medium.

The self-induced emf is also called the _back emf_ as it opposes any change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the _self-inductance plays the role of inertia_. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics. So, work needs to be done against the back emf (\(\varepsilon\)) in establishing the current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the current \(I\) at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}=\left|\dot{\varepsilon}\right|I\)

If we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect, then using Eq. (6.16),

\(\cdot\)

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}=L\ I\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

Total amount of work done in establishing the current \(I\) is

\(\cdot\)

\(W=\int\mathrm{d}W=\int\limits_{0}^{l}L\ I\ \mathrm{d}I\)

Thus, the energy required to build up the current \(I\) is,

\(\cdot\)

\(W=\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}\)

This expression reminds us of \(mv^{2}/2\) for the (mechanical) kinetic energy of a particle of mass \(m\), and shows that \(L\) is analogus to \(m\) (i.e., \(L\) is electrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).

Consider the general case of currents flowing simultaneously in two nearby coils. The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxes which exist independently. Equation (6.9) would be modified into

\(N_{1}\dot{\alpha}_{1}=M_{11}\,I_{1}+M_{12}\,I_{2}\)

where \(M_{11}\) represents inductance due to the same coil.

Therefore, using Faraday's law,

\(\cdot\)

\(\dot{\varepsilon}_{1}=-M_{11}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}-M_{12}\, \frac{\mathrm{d}I_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\)\(M_{11}\) is the _self-inductance_ and is written as \(L_{1}\). Therefore,

\[c_{1}=-L_{1}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}-M_{12}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{2}}{ \mathrm{d}t}\]

**Example 6.10** (a): Obtain the expression for the magnetic energy stored in a solenoid in terms of magnetic field \(B\), area \(A\) and length \(l\) of the solenoid. (b) How does this magnetic energy compare with the electrostatic energy stored in a capacitor?

**Solution**

(a) From Eq. (6.19), the magnetic energy is

\[\dot{U}_{B} = \frac{1}{2}L^{2}\] \[\cdot\] \[= \frac{1}{2}L\bigg{(}\frac{B}{\mu_{0}n}\bigg{)}^{2}\] (since

\[B\]

 = 

\[\mu_{0}nI\]

,for a solenoid).

\[\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\mu_{0}n^{2}A\big{)}\bigg{(}\frac{B}{\mu_{0}n}\bigg{)}^{2}\] [from Eq. (6.17)] \[\cdot\] \[= \frac{1}{2\mu_{0}}B^{2}Al\]

(b) The magnetic energy per unit volume is,

\[u_{B} = \frac{U_{B}}{V}\] (where

\[V\]

 is volume that contains flux) \[\cdot\] \[= \frac{U_{B}}{Al}\] \[\cdot = \frac{B^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}\] (6.20)

We have already obtained the relation for the electrostatic energy stored per unit volume in a parallel plate capacitor (refer to Chapter 2, Eq. 2.77),

\[u_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\,c_{0}E^{2} \tag{2.77}\]

In both the cases energy is proportional to the square of the field strength. Equations (6.20) and (2.77) have been derived for special cases: a solenoid and a parallel plate capacitor, respectively. But they are general and valid for any region of space in which a magnetic field or/and an electric field exist:

### AC Generator

The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction has been technologically exploited in many ways. An exceptionally important application is the generation of alternating currents (ac). The modern ac generator with a typical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this section, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine. The Yugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of the machine. As was pointed out in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emfor current in a loop is through a change in the loop's orientation or a change in its effective area. As the coil rotates in a magnetic field **B**, the effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular to the field) is \(A\) cos \(\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between **A** and **B**. This method of producing a flux change is the principle of operation of a simple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.16. It consists of a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called armature) is mechanically rotated in the uniform magnetic field by some external means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through it to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the coil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings and brushes.

When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed \(\omega\), the angle \(\theta\) between the magnetic field vector **B** and the area vector **A** of the coil at any instant \(t\) is \(\theta=\omega t\) (assuming \(\theta=0^{\circ}\) at \(t=0\)). As a result, the effective area of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from Eq. (6.1), the flux at any time \(t\) is

\(\phi_{\rm B}=BA\) cos \(\theta=BA\) cos \(\omega t\)

From Faraday's law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of \(N\) turns is then,

\(\varepsilon=-N\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{\rm B}}{\mathrm{dt}}=-NBA\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{dt}}(\cos\omega\,t)\)

Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf is

\(\varepsilon=NBA\,\omega\,sin\,\omega t\)

where \(NBA\omega\) is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when \(\sin\,\omega t=\pm 1\). If we denote \(NBA\omega\) as \(\varepsilon_{0}\), then

\(\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}\) sin \(\omega t\)

Since the value of the sine function varies between +1 and -1, the sign, or polarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.17 that the emf has its extremum value when \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) or \(\theta=270^{\circ}\), as the change of flux is greatest at these points.

The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current is called _alternating current_ (ac). Since \(\omega=2\pi\nu\), Eq (6.22) can be written as

\(\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}\)sin \(2\pi\nu\,t\)

where \(\nu\) is the frequency of revolution of the generator's coil.

Note that Eq. (6.22) and (6.23) give the instantaneous value of the emf and \(\varepsilon\) varies between \(+\varepsilon_{0}\) and \(-\varepsilon_{0}\) periodically. We shall learn how to determine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current in the next chapter.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:633]

The migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all of science. For example, every winter birds from Siberia fly unerringly to water spots in the Indian subcontinent. There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may provide a clue to these migratory patterns. The earth's magnetic field has existed throughout evolutionary history. It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to determine the direction. As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material. So electromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine direction. Consider the optimal case where the magnetic field **B**, the velocity of the bird **v**, and two relevant points of its anatomy separated by a distance \(L\) all three are mutually perpendicular. From the formula for motional emf, Eq. (6.5),

\(\varepsilon=Blu\)

Taking \(B=4\times 10^{-5}\) T, \(l=2\) cm wide, and \(v=10\) m/s, we obtain

\(\varepsilon=4\times 10^{-5}\times 2\times 10^{-2}\times 10\) V = \(8\times 10^{-6}\) V

\(=8\) mV

This extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful validity. Certain kinds of fish are able to detect small potential differences. However, in these fish, special cells have been identified which detect small voltage differences. In birds no such cells have been identified. Thus, the migration patterns of birds continues to remain a mystery.

## Summary

1. The magnetic flux through a surface of area **A** placed in a uniform magnetic field **B** is defined as, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{b}}=\textbf{B-A}=BA\cos\theta\) where \(\theta\) is the angle between **B** and **A**.
2. Faraday's laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of \(N\) turns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it, \(\varepsilon=-N\frac{\text{d}\Phi_{\text{b}}}{\text{d}t}\) Here \(\Phi_{\text{b}}\) is the flux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is closed, a current \(I=\varepsilon/R\) is set up in it, where \(R\) is the resistance of the circuit.
3. Lenz's law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday's law indicates this fact.
4. When a metal rod of length \(l\) is placed normal to a uniform magnetic field \(B\) and moved with a velocity \(v\) perpendicular to the field, the induced emf [called motional emf] across its ends is \(\varepsilon=Blu\)
5. Changing magnetic fields can set up current loops in nearby metal (any conductor) bodies. They dissipate electrical energy as heat. Such currents are called eddy currents.
6. Inductance is the ratio of the flux-linkage to current. It is equal to \(N\Phi/L\)* A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil (coil 1). This relation is given by, \(\alpha_{\rm i}=-M_{\rm 12}\frac{{\rm d}I_{\rm 2}}{{\rm d}t}\) The quantity \(M_{\rm 12}\) is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2. One can similarly define \(M_{\rm 21}\). There exists a general equality, \(M_{\rm 12}=M_{\rm 21}\)
* When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same coil. The self-induced emf is given by, \(\varepsilon=-L\frac{{\rm d}I}{{\rm d}t}\) \(L\) is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the coil against the change of current through it.
* The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of a magnetic material of permeability \(\mu_{c}\) is given by \(L=\mu_{c}\,\mu_{\rm 0}\,n^{2}\,{\rm d}\,t\) where \(A\) is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, \(I\) its length and \(n\) the number of turns per unit length.
* In an ac generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy by virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of \(N\) turn and area \(A\) is rotated at \(v\) revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field \(B\), then the motional emf produced is \(\varepsilon=NBA\) (2\(v\)) sin (2\(v\)) where we have assumed that at time \(t=0\) s, the coil is perpendicular to the field.

## 6 Points to Ponder

1. Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the nineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others established that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field. Somewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry demonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.
2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the changing magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy. However, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends. How is it related to the flux change?
3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently from Faraday's law using the Lorentz force on moving charges. However,

2. A circular loop being deformed into a narrow straight wire.

3 A long solenoid with 15 turns per cm has a small loop of area 2.0 cm\({}^{2}\) placed inside the solenoid normal to its axis. If the current carried by the solenoid changes steadily from 2.0 A to 4.0 A in 0.1 s, what is the induced emf in the loop while the current is changing?

4 A rectangular wire loop of sides 8 cm and 2 cm with a small cut is moving out of a region of uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.3 T directed normal to the loop. What is the emf developed across the cut if the velocity of the loop is 1 cm s-1 in a direction normal to the (a) longer side, (b) shorter side of the loop? For how long does the induced voltage last in each case?

5 A 1.0 m long metallic rod is rotated with an angular frequency of 400 rad s-1 about an axis normal to the rod passing through its one end. The other end of the rod is in contact with a circular metallic ring. A constant and uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T parallel to the axis exists everywhere. Calculate the emf developed between the centre and the ring.

6 A circular coil of radius 8.0 cm and 20 turns is rotated about its vertical diameter with an angular speed of 50 rad s-1 in a uniform horizontal magnetic field of magnitude \(3.0\times 10^{-2}\) T. Obtain the maximum and average emf induced in the coil. If the coil forms a closed loop of resistance 10 \(\Omega\), calculate the maximum value of current in the coil. Calculate the average power loss due to Joule heating. Where does this power come from?

## 6 Additional exercises

Suppose the loop in Exercise 6.4 is stationary but the current feeding the electromagnet that produces the magnetic field is gradually reduced so that the field decreases from its initial value of 0.3 T at the rate of 0.02 T s\({}^{-1}\). If the cut is joined and the loop has a resistance of 1.6 \(\Omega\), how much power is dissipated by the loop as heat? What is the source of this power?

A square loop of side 12 cm with its sides parallel to X and Y axes is moved with a velocity of 8 cm s\({}^{-1}\) in the positive \(x\)-direction in an environment containing a magnetic field in the positive \(z\)-direction. The field is neither uniform in space nor constant in time. It has a gradient of \(10^{-3}\)T cm\({}^{-1}\)along the negative \(x\)-direction (that is it increases by \(10^{-3}\) T cm\({}^{-1}\)as one moves in the negative \(x\)-direction), and it is decreasing in time at the rate of \(10^{-3}\)T s\({}^{-1}\). Determine the direction and magnitude of the induced current in the loop if its resistance is 4.50 m\(\Omega\).

It is desired to measure the magnitude of field between the poles of a powerful loud speaker magnet. A small flat search coil of area 2 cm\({}^{2}\) with 25 closely wound turns, is positioned normal to the field direction, and then quickly snatched out of the field region. Equivalently, one can give it a quick 90\({}^{\circ}\) turn to bring its plane parallel to the field direction). The total charge flown in the coil (measured by a ballistic galvanometer connected to coil) is 7.5 mC. The combined resistance of the coil and the galvanometer is 0.50 \(\Omega\). Estimate the field strength of magnet.

Figure 6.20 shows a metal rod PQ resting on the smooth rails AB and positioned between the poles of a permanent magnet. The rails, the rod, and the magnetic field are in three mutual perpendicular directions. A galvanometer G connects the rails through a switch K. Length of the rod = 15 cm, \(B\) = 0.50 T, resistance of the closed loop containing the rod = 9.0 m\(\Omega\). Assume the field to be uniform.

A line charge \(\lambda\) per unit length is lodged uniformly onto the rim of a wheel of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\). The wheel has light non-conducting spokes and is free to rotate without friction about its axis (Fig. 6.22). A uniform magnetic field extends over a circular region within the rim. It is given by,

\(\mathbf{B}=-\operatorname{B}_{0}\mathbf{k}\) (\(r\leq a\); \(a<R\))

= 0 (otherwise)

What is the angular velocity of the wheel after the field is suddenly switched off?

## Chapter Seven Altenus

CURRENT

### 7.1 Introduction

We have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function with time. Such a voltage is called _alternating voltage_ (ac voltage) and the current driven by it in a circuit is called the _alternating current_ (ac current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage. This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we tune our radio to a favourtic station, we are taking advantage of a special property of ac circuits - one of many that you will study in this chapter.

### 7.2 AC Voltage Applied to a Resistor

Figure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source \(\varepsilon\) of ac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit diagram is \(\odot\). We consider a source which produces sinusoidally varying potential difference across its terminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac voltage, be given by

\[v=v_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.1}\]

where \(v_{m}\) is the amplitude of the oscillating potential difference and \(\omega\)is its angular frequency.

To find the value of current through the resistor, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule \(\sum\varepsilon(t)=0\), to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to get

\[v_{m}\sin\omega t=tR\]

or \(i=\frac{v_{m}}{R}\sin\omega t\)

Since \(R\) is a constant, we can write this equation as

\[i=t_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.2}\]

where the current amplitude \(i_{m}\) is given by

\[t_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{R} \tag{7.3}\]

Equation (7.3) is just Ohm's law which for resistors works equally well for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a pure resistor and the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in particular that both \(v\) and \(i\) reach zero, minimum and maximum values at the same time. Clearly, _the voltage_ and _current are in phase with each other_.

We see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies sinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values during each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current values over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current is zero. The fact that the average current is zero, however, does

### 7.3 Representation of AC Current and Voltage

by Rotating Vectors -- Phasors

In the previous section, we learnt that the current through a resistor is in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case of an inductor, a capacitor or a combination of these circuit elements. In order to show phase relationship between voltage and current in an ac circuit, we use the notion of _phasors_. The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector which rotates about the origin with angular speed \(\omega\), as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical components of phasors **V** and **I** represent the sinusoidally varying quantities \(v\) and \(\iota\). The magnitudes of phasors **V** and **I** represent the amplitudes or the peak values \(v_{m}\) and \(i_{m}\) of these oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the voltage and current phasors and their relationship at time \(t_{1}\) for the case of an ac source connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., \(v_{m}\) sinot and \(i_{m}\) sinot, respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As they rotate with frequency \(\omega\), curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated. From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors **V** and **I** for the case of a resistor are in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase angle between the voltage and the current is zero.

### 7.4 AC Voltage Applied to an Inductor

Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually, inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall assume that this inductor has negligible resistance. Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let the voltage across the source be \(v=v_{m}\sin\omega t\). Using the Kirchhoff's loop rule, \(\sum\varepsilon(t)=0\), and since there is no resistor in the circuit,

\[v-L\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}t}=0 \tag{7.10}\]

where the second term is the self-induced Faraday emf in the inductor; and \(L\) is the self-inductance ofthe inductor. The negative sign follows from Lenz's law (Chapter 6). Combining Eqs. (7.1) and (7.10), we have

\[\frac{\cdot\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{v}{L}=\frac{v_{m}}{L}\sin\omega t \tag{7.11}\]

Equation (7.11) implies that the equation for \(\mathrm{d}\theta\), the current as a function of time, must be such that its slope \(\mathrm{d}i/\mathrm{d}t\) is a sinusoidally varying quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude given by \(v_{m}/L\). To obtain the current, we integrate \(\mathrm{d}i/\mathrm{d}t\) with respect to time:

\[\int\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t=\frac{v_{m}}{L}\int\sin( \omega t)\mathrm{d}t\]

and get,

\[i=-\frac{v_{m}}{\omega L}\cos(\omega t)+\mathrm{constant}\]

The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

Using

\[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[i=t_{m}\sin\left(\omega t-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \tag{7.12}\]

where \(t_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{\omega L}\) is the amplitude of the current. The quantity \(\omega\,L\) is analogous to the resistance and is called _inductive reactance_, denoted by \(X_{\mathrm{L}}\):

\[X_{\mathrm{L}}=\omega\,L \tag{7.13}\]

The amplitude of the current is, then

\[i_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{X_{\mathrm{L}}} \tag{7.14}\]

The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance and its SI unit is Ohm (\(\Omega\)). The inductive reactance limits the current in a purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the current in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.

A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by \(\pi/2\) or one-quarter (\(1/4\)) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current phasors in the present case at instant \(t_{\mathrm{i}}\). The current phasor **I** is \(\pi/2\) behind the voltage phasor **V**. When rotated with frequency \(\omega\) counterclockwise, they generate the voltage and current given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12), respectively and as shown in Fig. 7.6(b).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:646]

**0-1** Current \(t\) through the coil entering at A increase from zero to a maximum value. Flux lines are set up i.e., the core gets magnetised. With the polarity shown voltage and current are both positive. So their product \(p\) is positive. Energy is absorbed from the source.

**1-2** Current in the coil is still positive but is decreasing. The core gets magnetised and the net flux becomes zero at the end of a half cycle. The voltage \(v\) is negative (since d/d\(t\) is negative). The product of voltage and current is negative, and ENERGY is being RETURNED TO SOURCE.

**2-3** Current \(t\) becomes negative i.e., it enters at B and comes out of A. Since the direction of current has changed, the polarity of the magnet changes. The current and voltage are both negative. So their product \(p\) is positive. ENERGY is absorbed.

**3-4** Current \(t\) decreases and reaches its zero value at 4 when core is magnetised and flux is zero. The voltage is positive but the current is negative. The power is, therefore, negative. ENERGY ABSORBED DURING THE 1/4 CYCLE 2-3 IS RETURNED TO THE SOURCE.

### 7.5 AC Voltage Applied to a Capacitor

Figure 7.8 shows an ac source \(\varepsilon\) generating ac voltage \(v=v_{m}\) sin ot connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.

When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time required to charge the capacitor. As charge accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage across them increases, opposing the current. That is, a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.

When the capacitor is connected to an ac source, as in Fig. 7.8, it limits or regulates the current, but does not completely prevent the flow of charge. The capacitor is alternately charged and discharged as the current reverses each half cycle. Let \(q\) be the charge on the capacitor at any time \(t\). The instantaneous voltage \(v\)across the capacitor is

\[v=\frac{q}{C} \tag{7.15}\]

From the Kirchhoff's loop rule, the voltage across the source and the capacitor are equal,

\[v_{m}\sin\omega t=\frac{q}{C}\]

To find the current, we use the relation \(\dot{t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}\)

\[\dot{t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(v_{m}C\sin\omega t)=\omega Cv_{m}\cos (\omega t)\]

Using the relation, \(\cos(\omega t)=\sin(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{2})\), we have

\[\dot{t}=t_{m}\sin(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{2}) \tag{7.16}\]

where the amplitude of the oscillating current is \(\dot{t}_{m}=\omega Cv_{m}\). We can rewrite it as

\[\dot{t}_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{(1/\omega C)}\]

Comparing it to \(\dot{t}_{m}=v_{m}/R\) for a purely resistive circuit, we find that \((1/\omega C)\) plays the role of resistance. It is called _capacitive reactance_ and is denoted by \(X_{c}\).

\[X_{c}=1/\omega C \tag{7.17}\]

so that the amplitude of the current is

\[\dot{t}_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{X_{c}} \tag{7.18}\]

Figure 7.8: An ac source connected to a capacitor.

The dimension of capacitive reactance is the same as that of resistance and its SI unit is ohm (\(\Omega\)). The capacitive reactance limits the amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it is inversely proportional to the frequency and the capacitance.

A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the equation of source voltage, Eq. (7.1) shows that the current is \(\pi/2\) ahead of voltage.

Here the current \(\mathbf{I}\) is \(\pi/2\) ahead of the voltage phasor \(\mathbf{V}\) as they rotate counterclockwise. Figure 7.9(b) shows the variation of voltage and current with time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than the voltage by one-fourth of a period.

The instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is

\[\begin{array}{l}P_{c}=t\upsilon=t_{m}\cos(\omega t)\sin(\omega t)\\ =t_{m}\upsilon_{m}\cos(\omega t)\sin(\omega t)\\ =\frac{t_{m}\upsilon_{m}}{2}\sin(2\omega t)\end{array} \tag{7.19}\]

So, as in the case of an inductor, the average power

\[P_{c}=\left<\frac{t_{m}\upsilon_{m}}{2}\sin(2\omega t)\right>=\frac{t_{m} \upsilon_{m}}{2}\left<\sin(2\omega t)\right>=0\]

since \(<\sin(2\omega t)>=0\) over a complete cycle. Figure 7.10 explains it in detail. Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage by \(\pi/2\) and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by \(\pi/2\).

A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?

When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if \(C\) is reduced. With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (\(1/\omega C\)) and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine. Reducing \(C\) will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly than before.

A 15.0 \(\mu\)F capacitor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz source. Find the capacitive reactance and the current (rms and peak) in the circuit. If the frequency is doubled, what happens to the capacitive reactance and the current?

The capacitive reactance is

\[\dot{X}_{c}=\frac{1}{2\pi\,\upsilon C}=\frac{1}{2\pi(50\mathrm{Hz})(15.0\times 1 0^{-6}\mathrm{F})}=212\,\Omega\]

The rms current is

**0-1** The current \(i\) flows as shown and from the maximum at 0, reaches a zero value at 1. The plate A is charged to positive polarity while negative charge \(q\) builds up in B reaching a maximum at 1 until the current becomes zero. The voltage \(v_{i}=q/C\) is in phase with \(q\) and reaches maximum value at 1. Current and voltage are both positive. So \(p=v_{i}\) is positive. ENERGY is ABSORBED from THE SOURCE DURING THIS QUARTTY CYCLE AS THE CAPACITOR IS CHARGED.

**2-3** As \(t\) continues to flow from A to B, the capacitor is charged to reversed polarity i.e., the plate B acquires positive and A acquires negative charge. Both the current and the voltage are negative. Their product \(p\) is positive. The capacitor ABSORBS ENERGY during this 1/4 cycle.

**1-2** The current \(i\) reverses its direction. The accumulated charge is depleted i.e., the capacitor is discharged during this quarter cycle.The voltage gets reduced but is still positive. The current is negative. Their product, the power is negative. ENERGY THE ENERGY ABSORBED DURING THE SOURCE. NET ENERGY ABSORBED IS ZERO.

**3-4** The current \(t\) reverses its direction at **3** and flows from B to A. The accumulated charge is depleted and the magnitude of the voltage \(v_{i}\) is reduced. \(v_{i}\) becomes zero at **4** when the capacitor is fully discharged. The power is negative. ENERGY ABSORBED DURING **2-3** IS REUTRINED TO THE SOURCE. NET ENERGY ABSORBED IS ZERO.

#### 7.6.1 Phasor-diagram solution

From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12, we see that the resistor, inductor and capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be

\[i=t_{m}\sin(\omega t+\phi) \tag{7.21}\]

where \(\phi\) is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.

Let **I** be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by Eq. (7.21). Further, let \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\), \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}\), \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}\), and **V** represent the voltage across the inductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous section, we know that \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}\) is parallel to **I**, \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}\) is \(\pi/2\) behind **I** and \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\) is \(\pi/2\) ahead of **I**. \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\), \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}\), \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}\) and **I** are shown in Fig. 7.13(a) with appprpriate phase-relations.

The length of these phasors or the amplitude of \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}\), \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}\) and \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\) are:

\[v_{Rm}=t_{m}R,\ v_{Cm}=t_{m}X_{C},\ v_{Lm}=t_{m}X_{L} \tag{7.22}\]

The voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can be written as

\[v_{L}+v_{R}+v_{C}=v \tag{7.23}\]

The phasor relation whose vertical component gives the above equation is

\[\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}+\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}+\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}= \textbf{V} \tag{7.24}\]

This relation is represented in Fig. 7.13(b). Since \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}\) and \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\) are always along the same line and in opposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor (\(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}+\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\)) which has a magnitude \(\left|\ v_{Cm}-v_{Lm}\right|.\) Since **V** is represented as the hypotenouse of a right-traing whose sides are \(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{R}}\) and (\(\textbf{V}_{\textbf{C}}+\textbf{V}_{\textbf{L}}\)), the pythagorean theorem gives:

\[v_{m}^{2}=v_{Rm}^{2}+\left(v_{Cm}-v_{Lm}\right)^{2}\]

Substituting the values of \(v_{Rm}\), \(v_{Cm}\), and \(v_{Lm}\) from Eq. (7.22) into the above equation, we have

\[\dot{v_{m}^{2}} =(t_{m}R)^{2}+\left\{t_{m}X_{C}-t_{m}X_{L}\right\}^{2}\] \[=\dot{t_{m}^{2}}\left[R^{2}+\left(X_{C}-X_{L}\right)^{2}\right]\] \[\cdot\] \[\text{or, }\dot{t_{m}} =\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(X_{C}-X_{L}\right)^{2

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:653]

\[\cdot\]

\[L\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}q}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}+R\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}+\frac{q} {C}=v_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.28}\]

This is like the equation for a forced, damped oscillator, [see Eq. (14.37(b)) in Class XI Physics Textbook]. Let us assume a solution

\[q=q_{m}\sin\left(\omega t+\theta\right)\] (7.29(a))

so that \(\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=q_{m}\omega\cos(\omega t+\theta)\) (7.29(b))

and \(\frac{\cdot\mathrm{d}^{2}q}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=-q_{m}\omega^{2}\sin(\omega t+\theta)\) (7.29(c))

Substituting these values in Eq. (7.28), we get

\[q_{m}\omega\big{[}R\cos(\omega t+\theta)+\left(X_{c}-X_{L}\right)\sin(\omega t +\theta)\big{]}=v_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.30}\]

where we have used the relation \(X_{c}=1/\omega C\), \(X_{L}=\omega L\). Multiplying and dividing Eq. (7.30) by \(Z=\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(X_{c}-X_{L}\right)^{2}}\), we have

\[q_{m}\omega Z\bigg{[}\frac{R}{Z}\cos(\omega t+\theta)+\frac{\left(X_{c}-X_{L} \right)}{Z}\sin(\omega t+\theta)\bigg{]}=v_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.31}\]

Now, let \(\frac{R}{Z}=\cos\phi\)

and \(\frac{\left(X_{c}-X_{L}\right)}{Z}=\sin\phi\)

so that \(\phi=\tan^{-1}\frac{X_{c}-X_{L}}{R}\) (7.32)

Substituting this in Eq. (7.31) and simplifying, we get:

\[q_{m}\omega Z\cos(\omega t+\theta-\phi)=v_{m}\sin\omega t \tag{7.33}\]

Comparing the two sides of this equation, we see that

\(v_{m}=q_{m}\omega Z=t_{m}Z\)

where

\[\dot{t}_{m}=q_{m}\omega\] (7.33(a))

\[\cdot\]

and \(\theta-\phi=-\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\theta=-\frac{\pi}{2}+\phi\) (7.33(b))

Therefore, the current in the circuit is

\[\dot{t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=q_{m}\omega\cos(\omega t+\theta)\]

or \(\dot{t}=t_{m}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\) (7.34)

where \(t_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{Z}=\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(X_{c}-X_{L}\right)^{2}}}\) (7.34(a))

and \(\dot{\theta}=\tan^{-1}\frac{X_{c}-X_{L}}{R}\)Thus, the analytical solution for the amplitude and phase of the current in the circuit agrees with that obtained by the technique of phasors.

#### 7.6.3 Resonance

An interesting characteristic of the series _RLC_ circuit is the phenomenon of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency is called the system's _natural frequency_. If such a system is driven by an energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this phenomenon is a child on a swing. The the swing has a natural frequency for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the rope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the same as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will be large (Chapter 14, Class XI).

For an _RLC_ circuit driven with voltage of amplitude \(v_{m}\) and frequency \(\omega\), we found that the current amplitude is given by

\[\dot{t}_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{Z}=\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+(X_{c}-X_{L})^{2}}}\]

with \(X_{c}=1/\omega C\) and \(X_{L}=\omega L\). So if \(\omega\)is varied, then at a particular frequency \(\omega_{0}\), \(X_{c}=X_{L}\), and the impedance is minimum \(\dot{\left(Z=\sqrt{R^{2}+0^{2}}=R\right)}\). This frequency is called the _resonant frequency_:

\[X_{c}=X_{L}\text{ or }\frac{1}{\omega_{0}\,C}=\omega_{0}\,L \tag{7.35}\] \[\text{ or }\quad\omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\]

At resonant frequency, the current amplitude is maximum; \(\dot{t}_{m}=v_{m}/R\).

Figure 7.16 shows the variation of \(\dot{t}_{m}\) with \(\omega\)in a _RLC_ series circuit with \(L=1.00\) mH, \(C=1.00\) nF for two values of \(R\): (i) \(R=100\)\(\Omega\) and (ii) \(R=200\)\(\Omega\). For the source applied \(v_{m}=100\) V. \(\omega_{0}\) for this case is \(\dot{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\right)}=1.00\times 10^{6}\) rad/s.

We see that the current amplitude is maximum at the resonant frequency. Since \(\dot{t}_{m}=v_{m}/R\) at resonance, the current amplitude for case (i) is twice to that for case (ii).

Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the tuning mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit can be driven at many frequencies.

But to hear one particular radio station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of the signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.

_It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a circuit only if both \(L\) and \(C\) are present in the circuit. Only then do the voltages across \(L\) and \(C\) cancel each other (both being out of phase) and the current amplitude is \(v_{m}/R\), the total source voltage appearing across \(R\). This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or RC circuit._

### Sharpness of resonance

The amplitude of the current in the series _LCR_ circuit is given by

\[i_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(\omega\,L-\frac{1}{\omega\,C}\right)^{2}}}\]

and is maximum when \(\omega=\omega_{0}=1/\sqrt{LC}\). The maximum value is \(i_{m}^{\max}=v_{m}/R\).

For values of \(\omega\) other than \(\omega_{0}\), the amplitude of the current is less than the maximum value. Suppose we choose a value of \(\omega\) for which the current amplitude is \(1/\sqrt{2}\) times its maximum value. At this value, the power dissipated by the circuit becomes half. From the curve in Fig. (7.16), we see that there are two such values of \(\omega\), say, \(\omega_{1}\) and \(\omega_{2}\), one greater and the other smaller than \(\omega_{0}\) and symmetrical about \(\omega_{0}\). We may write

\[\omega_{1} =\omega_{0}+\Delta\omega\] \[\omega_{2} =\omega_{0}-\Delta\omega\]

The difference \(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}=2\Delta\omega\)is often called the _bandwidth_ of the circuit. The quantity \(\left(\omega_{0}\ /\ 2\Delta\omega\right)\) is regarded as a measure of the sharpness of resonance. The smaller the \(\Delta\omega\), the sharper or narrower is the resonance. To get an expression for \(\Delta\omega\), we note that the current amplitude \(i_{m}\) is \(\left(1/\sqrt{2}\right)i_{m}^{\max}\) for \(\omega_{1}=\omega_{0}+\Delta\omega\). Therefore,

\[\text{at }\omega_{1},\quad i_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left( \omega_{1}L-\frac{1}{\omega_{1}C}\right)^{2}}}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \\[\begin{array}{c}\text{or}\qquad\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(\omega_{1}L-\frac{1}{\omega_{1} C}\right)^{2}}=R\sqrt{2}\\ \cdot\\ \text{or}\qquad R^{2}+\left(\omega_{1}L-\frac{1}{\omega_{1}C}\right)^{2}=2R^{2} \\ \cdot\\ \omega_{1}L-\frac{1}{\omega_{1}C}=R\end{array}\]

which may be written as,

\[\begin{array}{c}\left\{\omega_{0}+\Delta\omega\right\}L-\frac{1}{\left( \omega_{0}+\Delta\omega\right)C}=R\\ \cdot\\ \omega_{0}L\left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)-\frac{1}{\omega_{0} C\left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)}=R\end{array}\]

Using \(\omega_{0}^{2}=\frac{1}{LC}\) in the second term on the left hand side, we get

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \omega_{0}L\left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)-\frac{\omega_{0}L}{ \left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)}=R\\ \cdot\\ \text{We can approximate }\overset{\cdot}{\left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}} \right)^{-1}}\overset{\cdot}{\text{as}}\overset{\cdot}{\left(1-\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)}\text{ since }\overset{\cdot}{\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}<<1}\text{. Therefore,}\\ \cdot\\ \omega_{0}L\left(1+\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)-\omega_{0}L\left(1- \frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)=R\\ \cdot\\ \text{or}\qquad\omega_{0}L\frac{2\Delta\omega}{\omega_{0}}=R\\ \cdot\\ \Delta\omega=\frac{R}{2L}\end{array}\]

The sharpness of resonance is given by,

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \frac{\omega_{0}}{2\Delta\omega}=\frac{\omega_{0}L}{R}\end{array}\]

The ratio \(\frac{\omega_{0}L}{R}\) is also called the _quality factor_, \(\mathcal{G}\) of the circuit.

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \mathcal{G}=\frac{\omega_{0}L}{R}\end{array}\]

From Eqs. [7.36 (b)] and [7.36 (c)], we see that \(2\Delta\omega=\frac{\omega_{0}}{\mathcal{G}}\). So, larger the value of \(Q\), the smaller is the value of \(2\Delta\omega\) or the bandwidth and sharper is the resonance. Using \(\omega_{0}^{2}=1/\,L\,C\), Eq. [7.36(c)] can be equivalently expressed as \(Q=1/\,\omega_{0}\,CR\).

We see from Fig. 7.15, that if the resonance is less sharp, not only is the maximum current less, the circuit is close to resonance for a larger range \(\Delta\omega\) of frequencies and the tuning of the circuit will not be good. So, less sharp the resonance, less is the selectivity of the circuit or vice versa. From Eq. (7.36), we see that if quality factor is large, i.e., \(R\) is low or \(L\) is large, the circuit is more selective.

**Example 7.6** A resistor of 200 \(\Omega\) and a capacitor of 15.0 \(\mu\)F are connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source. (a) Calculate the current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.

**Solution**

Given

\(R=200\,\Omega\), \(C=15.0\,\mu\)F = \(15.0\times 10^{-6}\)F

\(V=220\,\mathrm{V}\), \(\nu=50\,\mathrm{Hz}\)

(a) In order to calculate the current, we need the impedance of the circuit. It is

\[Z =\sqrt{R^{2}+X_{c}^{2}}=\sqrt{R^{2}+(2\pi\,\nu C)^{2}}\] \[:=\sqrt{(200\,\Omega)^{2}+(2\times 3.14\times 50\times 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{F})^{2}}\] \[=\sqrt{(200\,\Omega)^{2}+(212\,\Omega)^{2}}\] \[=291.5\,\Omega\]

Therefore, the current in the circuit is

\[I=\frac{V}{Z}=\frac{220\,\mathrm{V}}{291.5\,\Omega}=0.755\,\mathrm{A}\]

(b) Since the current is the same throughout the circuit, we have \(V_{R}=IR=(0.755\,\mathrm{A})(200\,\Omega)=151\,\mathrm{V}\)

\[V_{C}=IX_{c}=(0.755\,\mathrm{A})(212.3\,\Omega)=160.3\,\mathrm{V}\]

The algebraic sum of the two voltages, \(V_{R}\) and \(V_{C}\) is 311.3 V which is more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this paradox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not in the same phase. Therefore, _they cannot be added like ordinary numbers_. The two voltages are out of phase by miately degrees. Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem: \(V_{R:c}=\sqrt{V_{R}^{2}+V_{c}^{2}}\)

= 220 V

Thus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the source.

### 7.7 Power in AC Circuit: The Power Factor

We have seen that a voltage \(v=v_{m}\sin\!\omega\) applied to a series \(RLC\) circuit drives a current in the circuit given by \(t=t_{m}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\) where

\(\dot{t}_{m}=\frac{v_{m}}{Z}\) and \(\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X_{c}-X_{L}}{R}\right)\)

Therefore, the instantaneous power \(p\) supplied by the source is

\(\dot{p}=v\dot{t}=\left(v_{m}\sin\omega t\right)\times\left[t_{m}\sin(\omega t +\phi)\right]\)

\(\dot{\cdot}\)

\(=\frac{v_{m}t_{m}}{2}[\cos\phi-\cos(2\omega t+\phi)]\)

The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in R.H.S. of Eq. (7.37). It is only the second term which is time-dependent. Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative half). Therefore,

\(\dot{\cdot}\)

\(P=\frac{v_{m}t_{m}}{2}\cos\phi=\frac{v_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{t_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\phi\)

\(\dot{\cdot}\)

\(=V\,I\cos\phi\)

This can also be written as,

\(\dot{P}=I^{2}\,Z\cos\phi\)

So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and current but also on the cosine of the phase angle \(\phi\) between them. The quantity \(\cos\phi\) is called the _power factor_. Let us discuss the following cases:

**Case (i)**_Resistive circuit_: If the circuit contains only pure \(R\), it is called _resistive_. In that case \(\phi=0\), \(\cos\phi=1\). There is maximum power dissipation.

**Case (ii)**_Purely inductive or capacittive circuit_: If the circuit contains only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between voltage and current is \(\pi/2\). Therefore, \(\cos\phi=0\), and no power is dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes referred to as _wattless current_.

**Case (iii)**_LCR series circuit_: In an _LCR_ series circuit, power dissipated is given by Eq. (7.38) where \(\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(X_{c}-X_{L}\right)/R\). So, \(\phi\) may be non-zero in a \(RL\) or \(RC\) or \(RCL\) circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in the resistor.

**Case (iv)**_Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit_: At resonance \(X_{c}-X_{L}^{\prime}=0\), and \(\phi=0\). Therefore, \(\cos\phi=1\) and \(P=I^{2}Z=I^{2}\,R\). That is, maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through \(R\)) at resonance.

**Example7.7** (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.

(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of appropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.

**Solution** (a) We know that \(P=I\lor\cos\phi\) where \(\cos\phi\) is the power factor. To supply a given power at a given voltage, if \(\cos\phi\) is small, we have to increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss (_F_R_) in transmission.

(b)Suppose in a circuit, current \(I\) lags the voltage by an angle \(\phi\). Then power factor \(\cos\phi=\)_R_/Z.

We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making \(Z\) tend to \(R\). Let us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.17) how this can be achieved. Let us resolve **I** into two components. \(\textbf{I}_{p}\) along the applied voltage **V** and \(\textbf{I}_{q}\) perpendicular to the applied voltage. \(\textbf{I}_{q}\) as you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the waitless component since corresponding to this component of current, there is no power loss. \(\textbf{I}_{p}\) is known as the power component because it is in phase with the voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.

It's clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor, we must completely neutralize the lagging waitless current \(\textbf{I}_{q}\) by an equal leading waitless current \(\textbf{I}_{q}^{\prime}\). This can be done by connecting a capacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that \(\textbf{I}_{q}\) and \(\textbf{I}_{q}\) cancel each other and \(P\) is effectively \(I_{p}\) V.

**Example 7.8** A sinusoidal voltage of peak value 283 V and frequency 50 Hz is applied to a series _LCR_ circuit in which R = 3 \(\Omega\), \(L=25.48\) mH, and C = 796 \(\mu\)F. Find (a) the impedance of the circuit; (b) the phase difference between the voltage across the source and the current; (c) the power dissipated in the circuit; and (d) the power factor.

**Solution**

(a) To find the impedance of the circuit, we first calculate \(X_{\text{L}}\) and \(X_{\text{C}}\).

\(X_{\text{L}}=2\pi\nu L\)

\(=2\times 3.14\times 50\times 25.48\times 10^{-3}\,\Omega=8\,\Omega\)

\(X_{\text{C}}=\dfrac{1}{2\pi\nu\textbf{C}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:661]

**Example 7.10**: At an airport, a person is made to walk through the doorway of a metal detector, for security reasons. If she/he is carrying anything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what principle does this detector work?

**Solution**: The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are, in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the circuit changes - resulting in significant change in current in the circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm.

### 7.8 LC Oscillations

We know that a capacitor and an inductor can store electrical and magnetic energy, respectively. When a capacitor (initially charged) is connected to an inductor, the charge on the capacitor and the current in the circuit exhibit the phenomenon of electrical oscillations similar to oscillations in mechanical systems (Chapter 14, Class XI).

Let a capacitor be charged \(q_{m}\) (at \(t=0\)) and connected to an inductor as shown in Fig. 7.18.

The moment the circuit is completed, the charge on the capacitor starts decreasing, giving rise to current in the circuit. Let \(q\) and \(i\) be the charge and current in the circuit at time \(t\). Since \(\mathrm{d}t/\mathrm{d}t\) is positive, the induced emf in \(L\) will have polarity as shown, i.e., \(v_{b}<v_{a}\). According to Kirchhoff's loop rule,

\[\frac{\cdot}{C}-L\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}t}=0 \tag{7.39}\]

\(t=-(\mathrm{d}q/\mathrm{d}t)\) in the present case (as \(q\) decreases, increases). Therefore, Eq. (7.39) becomes:

\[\frac{\cdot}{\mathrm{d}^{2}q}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}+\frac{1}{LC}q=0 \tag{7.40}\]

This equation has the form \(\frac{\cdot}{\mathrm{d}^{2}x}+o_{0}^{2}\,x=0\) for a simple harmonic oscillator. The charge, therefore, oscillates with a natural frequency

\[\omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{7.41}\]

and varies sinusoidally with time as

\[q=q_{m}\cos\left(\omega_{0}\,t+\phi\right) \tag{7.42}\]

where \(q_{m}\) is the maximum value of \(q\) and \(\phi\) is a phase constant. Since \(q=q_{m}\) at \(t=0\), we have \(\cos\,\phi=1\) or \(\phi=0\). Therefore, in the present case,

Figure 7.18: At the instant shown, the current is increasing so the polarity of induced emf in the inductor is as shown.

\[\dot{q}=q_{m}\cos(\omega_{0}t) \tag{7.43}\]

The current \(t\left(=-\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)\) is given by

\[\dot{t}=\dot{t}_{m}\sin(\omega_{0}t) \tag{7.44}\]

where \(\dot{t}_{m}=\omega_{0}q_{m}\)

Let us now try to visualise how this oscillation takes place in the circuit.

Figure 7.19(a) shows a capacitor with initial charge \(q_{m}\) connected to an ideal inductor. The electrical energy stored in the charged capacitor is.

\[U_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{q_{m}^{2}}{C}\]

. Since, there is no current in the circuit, energy in the inductor is zero. Thus, the total energy of \(LC\) circuit is,

\[U=U_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{q_{m}^{2}}{C}\]

At \(t=0\), the switch is closed and the capacitor starts to discharge [Fig. 7.19(b)]. As the current increases, it sets up a magnetic field in the inductor and thereby, some energy gets stored in the inductor in the form of magnetic energy: \(U_{B}=(1/2)\ L^{2}\). As the current reaches its maximum value \(\dot{t}_{m}\), (at \(t=T/4\)) as in Fig. 7.19(c), all the energy is stored in the magnetic field: \(U_{B}=(1/2)\ L^{2}_{m}\). You can easily check that the maximum electrical energy equals the maximum magnetic energy. The capacitor now has no charge and hence no energy. The current now starts charging the capacitor, as in Fig. 7.19(d). This process continues till the capacitor is fully charged (at \(t=T/2\)) [Fig. 7.19(e)]. But it is charged with a polarity opposite to its initial state in Fig. 7.19(a). The whole process just described will now repeat itself till the system reverts to its original state. Thus, the energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor.

Figure 7.19: The oscillations in an \(LC\) circuit are analogous to the oscillation of a block at the end of a spring. The figure depicts one-half of a cycle.

The _LC_ oscillation is similar to the mechanical oscillation of a block attached to a spring. The lower part of each figure in Fig. 19 depicts the corresponding stage of a mechanical system (a block attached to a spring). As noted earlier, for a block of a mass \(m\) oscillating with frequency \(\omega_{0}\), the equation is

\[\frac{\dot{\mathrm{d}}^{2}x}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}+\omega_{0}^{2}x=0\]

Here, \(\omega_{0}=\sqrt{k/m}\), and \(k\) is the spring constant. So, \(x\) corresponds to \(q\). In case of a mechanical system \(F=ma=m(\mathrm{d}v/\mathrm{d}\theta)=m(\mathrm{d}^{2}x/\mathrm{d}t^{2})\). For an electrical system, \(\varepsilon=-L(\mathrm{d}i/\mathrm{d}t)=-L(\mathrm{d}^{2}q/\mathrm{d}t^{2})\). Comparing these two equations, we see that \(L\) is analogous to mass \(m\): \(L\) is a measure of resistance to change in current. In case of \(LC\) circuit, \(\omega_{0}=1/\sqrt{LC}\) and for mass on a spring, \(\omega_{0}=\sqrt{k/m}\). So, \(1/C\)is analogous to \(k\). The constant \(k\) (=\(F/x\)) tells us the (external) force required to produce a unit displacement whereas \(1/C\)(=\(V/q\)) tells us the potential difference required to store a unit charge. Table 1 gives the analogy between mechanical and electrical quantities.

_Note that the above discussion of LC oscillations is not realistic for two reasons_:

1. Every inductor has some resistance. The effect of this resistance is to introduce a damping effect on the charge and current in the circuit and the oscillations finally die away.
2. Even if the resistance were zero, the total energy of the system would not remain constant. It is radiated away from the system in the form of electromagnetic waves (discussed in the next chapter). In fact, radio and TV transmitters depend on this radiation.

You may like to compare the treatment of a forced damped oscillator discussed in Section 14.10 of Class XI physics textbook, with that of an _LCR_ circuit when an ac voltage is applied in it. We have already remarked that Eq. [14.37(b)] of Class XI Textbook is exactly similar to Eq. (7.28) here, although they use different symbols and parameters. Let us therefore list the equlvalence between different quantities in the two situations:

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Forced oscillations_ & _Driven LCR circuit_ \\ \(\cdot\) & \(L\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}q}{\mathrm{d}t}+R\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}+\frac{q} {C}=v_{m}\sin\omega t\) \\ Displacement, \(x\) & Charge on capacitor, \(q\) \\ Time, \(t\) & Time, \(t\) \\ Mass, \(m\) & Self inductance, \(L\) \\ Damping constant, \(b\) & Resistance, \(R\) \\ Spring constant, \(k\) & Inverse capacitance, \(1/C\) \\ Driving frequency, \(\omega_{\mathrm{d}}\) & Driving frequency, \(\omega\) \\ Natural frequency of oscillations, \(\omega\) & Natural frequency of LCR circuit, \(\omega_{\mathrm{b}}\) \\ Amplitude of forced oscillations, \(A\) & Maximum charge stored, \(q_{m}\) \\ Amplitude of driving force, \(F_{0}\) & Amplitude of applied voltage, \(v_{m}\) \\ \end{tabular}

You must note that since \(x\)corresponds to \(q\), the amplitude \(A\) (maximum displacement) will correspond to the maximum charge stored, \(q_{m}\). Equation [14.39 (a)] of Class XI gives the amplitude of oscillations in terms of other parameters, which we reproduce here for convenience:

\[A=\frac{F_{0}}{\left\{m^{2}(\omega^{2}-\omega_{d}^{2})^{2}+\omega_{d}^{2}b^{2} \right\}^{1/2}}\]

Replace each parameter in the above equation by the corresponding electrical quantity, and see what happens. Eliminate \(L\), \(C\), \(\omega\), and \(\omega_{0}\), using \(X_{i}\)= \(\omega\)L, \(X_{c}=1/\omega C\), and \(\omega_{0}^{2}=1/LC\). When you use Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), you will see that there is a perfect match.

You will come across numerous such situations in physics where diverse physical phenomena are represented by the same mathematical equation. If you have dealt with one of them, and you come across another situation, you may simply replace the corresponding quantities and interpret the result in the new context. We suggest that you may try to find more such parallel situations from different areas of physics. One must, of course, be aware of the differences too.

**Example 7.11**: Show that in the free oscillations of an _LC_ circuit, the sum of energies stored in the capacitor and the inductor is constant in time.
**Solution**: Let \(q_{0}\) be the initial charge on a capacitor. Let the charged capacitor be connected to an inductor of inductance \(L\). As you have studied in Section 7.8, this LC circuit will sustain an oscillation with frequency

\[\omega\left(=2\,\pi\,\nu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\right)\]

At an instant \(t\), charge \(q\) on the capacitor and the current \(i\) are given by:

\(q\left(t\right)=q_{0}\cos\,\mathit{at}\)

\(t\left(t\right)=-q_{0}\,\omega\sin\,\mathit{at}\)

Energy stored in the capacitor at time \(t\) is

\[U_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\,C\;V^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{q^{2}}{C}\frac{q_{0}^{2}}{2C} \cos^{2}\left(\mathit{at}\right)\]

Energy stored in the inductor at time \(t\) is

\[U_{u}=\frac{1}{2}\,L\;t^{2}\]

\[=\frac{1}{2}\,L\;q_{0}^{2}\,\omega^{2}\sin^{2}\left(\mathit{at}\right)\]

\[=\frac{q_{0}^{2}}{2C}\sin^{2}\left(\mathit{at}\right)\;\;\left(\because\alpha^ {2}=1/\sqrt{LC}\right)\]

Sum of energies

\[U_{E}+U_{M}= \frac{q_{0}^{2}}{2C}\left[\cos^{2}\mathit{at}+\sin^{2}\mathit{at} \right]\] \[\cdot \cdot \cdot = \frac{q_{0}^{2}}{2C}\]

This sum is constant in time as \(q\), and \(C\), both are time-independent. Note that it is equal to the initial energy of the capacitor. Why it is so? Think!

### Transformers

For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with a device called _transformer_ using the principle of mutual induction.

A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other. They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in Fig. 7.20(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.20(b). One of the coils called the _primary coil_ has _N_\({}_{p}\) turns. The other coil is called the _secondary coil_; it has _N_\({}_{t}\) turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.

When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary, the resulting current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both primary and secondary windings. Let \(\phi\) be the flux in each turn in the core at time \(t\) due to current in the primary when a voltage \(v_{p}\) is applied to it.

Then the induced emf or voltage \(\varepsilon_{s}\), in the secondary with \(N_{s}\) turns is \(\cdot\)

\[\varepsilon_{s}=-N_{s}\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{7.45}\]

The alternating flux \(\phi\) also induces an emf, called back emf in the primary. This is

\[\cdot\]

\[\varepsilon_{p}=-N_{p}\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t} \tag{7.46}\]

But \(\varepsilon_{p}=v_{p}\), If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite since the primary has zero resistance(as assumed). If the secondary is an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good approximation

\[\varepsilon_{s}=v_{s}\]

where \(v_{s}\) is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.45) and (7.46) can be written as

\[v_{s}=-N_{s}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t}\] (7.45[a])

\[v_{p}=-N_{p}\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t}\] (7.46[a])

From Eqs. (7.45 (a)] and (7.45 (a)], we have

\[\frac{v_{s}}{v_{p}}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}} \tag{7.47}\]

Figure 7.20: Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer: (a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.

Note that the above relation has been obtained using three assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.

If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses), the power input is equal to the power output, and since \(p=i\,v\),

\[t_{p}v_{p}=t_{s}v_{s} \tag{7.48}\]

Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation, since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than 95%. Combining Eqs. (7.47) and (7.48), we have

\[\frac{i_{p}}{i_{s}}=\frac{v_{s}}{v_{p}}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}} \tag{7.49}\]

Since \(i\) and \(v\) both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source, Eq. (7.49) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of corresponding quantities.

Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current. We have:

\[V_{s}=\left(\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\right)V_{p}\quad\text{and}\quad I_{s}=\left( \frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}}\right)I_{p} \tag{7.50}\]

That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary (\(N_{s}>N_{p}\)), the voltage is stepped up(\(V_{s}>V_{p}\)). This type of arrangement is called a _step-up transformer_. However, in this arrangement, there is less current in the secondary than in the primary (\(N_{p}/N_{s}<1\) and \(I_{s}<I_{p}\)). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and the secondary has 200 turns, \(N_{p}/N_{p}=2\) and \(N_{p}/N_{s}\)=1/2. Thus, a 220V input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.

If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary(\(N_{s}<N_{p}\)), we have a _step-down transformer_. In this case, \(V_{s}<V_{p}\) and \(I_{s}>I_{p}\). That is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current is increased.

The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do occur due to the following reasons:

(i) _Flux Leakage_: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.

(ii) _Resistance of the windings_: The wire used for the windings has some resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire (\(I^{2}R\)). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by using thick wire.

(iii) _Eddy currents_: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by having a laminated core.

(iv) _Hysteresis_: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic material which has a low hysteresis loss.

The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and consequently, the \(I^{2}R\) loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.

## Summary

1. An alternating voltage \(\upsilon=\upsilon_{m}\sin\omega t\) applied to a resistor \(R\) drives a current \(i=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{R}\) snot in the resistor, \(i_{m}=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{R}\). The current is in phase with the applied voltage.
2. For an alternating current \(i=i_{m}\) snot passing through a resistor \(R\), the average power loss \(P\) (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is \((1/2)\,l_{m}^{2}R\). To express it in the same form as the dc power (\(P=I^{2}R\)), a special value of current is used. It is called _root mean square_ (rms) _current_ and is donated by \(I\): \(I=\frac{t_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707\,i_{m}\) Similarly, the _rms voltage_ is defined by \(V=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707\,\upsilon_{m}\) We have \(P=IV=I^{2}R\)
3. An ac voltage \(\upsilon=\upsilon_{m}\) snot applied to a pure inductor \(L\) drives a current in the inductor \(i=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{\omega}\), snot (\(\omega-\pi/2\)), where \(\{\upsilon_{m}=\upsilon_{m}/X_{L}\), \(X_{L}=aL\) is called _inductive reactance_. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by \(\pi/2\). The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle is zero.
4. An ac voltage \(\upsilon=\upsilon_{m}\) snot applied to a capacitor drives a current in the capacitor: \(t=i_{m}\sin\omega t\) (\(\omega+\pi/2\)). Here,. \(t_{m}=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{X_{C}}\), \(X_{C}=\frac{1}{a\sigma C}\) is called _capacitive reactance_. The current through the capacitor is \(\pi/2\) ahead of the applied voltage. As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor over one complete cycle is zero.
5. For a series \(RLC\) circuit driven by voltage \(\upsilon=\upsilon_{m}\) snot, the current is given by \(i=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{\omega}\sin\omega t\) (\(\omega+\phi\)) where \(i_{m}=\frac{\upsilon_{m}}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(X_{C}-X_{L}\right)^{2}}}\) and \(\phi=\tan^{-1}\frac{X_{C}-X_{L}}{R}\) \(Z=\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(X_{C}-X_{L}\right)^{2}}\) is called the _impedance_ of the circuit.

The average power loss over a complete cycle is given by

\(P=V\,I\,\cos\phi\)

The term \(\cos\phi\) is called the _power factor_.
6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, \(\cos\phi=0\) and no power is dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases, current is referred to as a _wattless current_.
7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by rotating vectors called _phasors_. A phasor is a vector which rotates about the origin with angular speed \(\omega\). The magnitude of a phasor represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or current) represented by the phasor. The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor diagram.
8. An interesting characteristic of a series RLC circuit is the phenomenon of _resonance_. The circuit exhibits resonance, i.e., the amplitude of the current is maximum at the resonant frequency, \(\omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\). The _quality factor_\(Q\) defined by \(Q=\frac{\omega_{0}L}{R}=\frac{1}{\omega_{0}CR}\) is an indicator of the sharpness of the resonance, the higher value of \(Q\) indicating sharper peak in the current.
9. A circuit containing an inductor \(L\) and a capacitor \(C\) (initially charged) with no ac source and no resistors exhibits _free oscillations_. The charge \(q\) of the capacitor satisfies the equation of simple harmonic motion: \[\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}q}{dt^{2}}+\frac{1}{LC}q=0\] and therefore, the frequency \(\omega\) of free oscillation is \(\omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\). The energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor but their sum or the total energy is constant in time.
10. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary coil of \(N_{p}\) turns and a secondary coil of \(N_{s}\) turns. If the primary coil is connected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are related by \(\cdot\) \(V_{s}=\left(\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\right)V_{p}\) and the currents are related by \(\cdot\) \(I_{s}=\left(\frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}}\right)I_{p}\) If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the voltage is stepped-up (\(V_{s}>V_{p}\)). This type of arrangement is called a _step-up transformer_. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we have a _step-down transformer_.

## 5 Points to Ponder

1. When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarly the rms value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is normally 240 V. This refers to the _rms_ value of the voltage. The amplitude of this voltage is \[\dot{v}_{m}=\sqrt{2}V=\sqrt{2}(240)=340\,\mathrm{V}\]
2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average power rating.
3. The power consumed in an circuit is never negative.
4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes. But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating is such a property, and there is one ampere of _rms_ value of alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce under the same conditions.
5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one should take care of their phases properly. For example, if \(V_{x}\) and \(V_{c}\) are voltages across \(R\) and \(C\), respectively in an \(RC\) circuit, then the total voltage across \(RC\) combination is \(V_{RC}=\sqrt{V_{R}^{2}+V_{C}^{2}}\) and not \(V_{x}+V_{c}\) since \(V_{c}\) is \(\pi/2\) out of phase of \(V_{x}\)
6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding magnitudes and directions. The 'rotating vectors' that represent harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know as the law of vector addition.
7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy in an ac circuit is the resistive element.
8. In a \(RLC\) circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when \(X_{L}=X_{c}\) or \(\omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\). For resonance to occur, the presence of both \(L\) and \(C\) elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (\(L\) or \(C\)) elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence, no resonance is possible.
9. The power factor in a \(RLC\) circuit is a measure of how close the circuit is to expending the maximum power.
10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply transform energy from one form to another.
11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage. This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The current is reduced by the same proportion.
12. The choice of whether the description of an oscillatory motion is by means of sines or cosines or by their linear combinations is unimportant, since changing the zero-time position transforms the one to the other.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:676]

the speed of light( 3 \(\times 10^{8}\) m/s), obtained from optical measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell's work thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use by Marconi and others led in due course to the revolution in communication that we are witnessing today.

In this chapter, we first discuss the need for displacement current and its consequences. Then we present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves. The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves, stretching from \(\gamma\) rays (wavelength \(\sim\)10-12 m) to long radio waves (wavelength \(\sim\)10\({}^{6}\) m) is described. How the electromagnetic waves are sent and received for communication is discussed in Chapter 15.

### 8.2 Displacement Current

We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current produces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed that for logical consistency, a changing electric field _must_ also produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great importance because it explains the existence of radio waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other forms of electromagnetic waves.

To see how a changing electric field gives rise to a magnetic field, let us consider the process of chargling of a capacitor and apply Ampere's circutal law given by (Chapter 4)

\[\mathbf{\hat{\gamma}B\cdot dl}=\mu_{0}\,i\,(t) \tag{8.1}\]

to find magnetic field at a point outside the capacitor. Figure 8.1 shows a parallel plate capacitor \(C\) which is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent current \(i\,(t)\) flows. Let us find the magnetic field at a point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate capacitor. For this, we consider a plane circular loop of radius \(r\) whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of the current-carrying wire, and which is centred symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From symmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the circumference of the circular loop and is the same in magnitude at all points on the loop so that if \(B\) is the magnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is \(B\,(2\pi\,\eta)\). So we have

\[B\,(2\pi r)=\mu_{0}\,i\,(t) \tag{8.2}\]Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This is a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box (without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere's circuital law to such surfaces with the _same_ perimeter, we find that the left hand side of Eq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is _zero_ and _not_\(\mu_{0}\)_i_, since _no_ current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we have a _contradiction_; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a point P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.

Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere's circuital law, this law must be missing something. The missing term must be such that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter what surface is used.

We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S _between_ the plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the capacitor have an area \(A\), and a total charge \(\mathcal{G}\), the magnitude of the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) between the plates is \((\mathcal{G}/A)/\epsilon_{0}\) (see Eq. 2.41). The field is perpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude over the area \(A\) of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what is the _electric_ flux \(\omega_{E}\) through the surface \(S\)? Using Gauss's law, it is

\[\begin{split}\dot{\omega}_{E}=&\left|\mathbf{E} \right|A=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\frac{\mathcal{G}}{A}A=\frac{\mathcal{G}}{ \epsilon_{0}}\end{split} \tag{8.3}\]

Now if the charge \(\mathcal{G}\) on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a current \(i=\left\{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{G}/\mathrm{d}\mathcal{G}\right\}\), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have

\[\begin{split}\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega_{E}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{ \mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{\mathcal{G}}{\epsilon_{0}}\right)=& \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{G}}{\mathrm{d}t}\end{split}\]

This implies that for consistency,

\[\begin{split}\dot{\epsilon}_{0}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\omega_{E}}{ \mathrm{d}t}\right)=i\end{split} \tag{8.4}\]

This is the missing term in Ampere's circuital law. If we generalise this law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through the surface, another term which is \(\epsilon_{0}\) times the rate of change of electric flux through the same surface, the _total_ has the same value of current \(i\) for all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of \(B\) obtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere's law. \(B\) at the point P is non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. \(B\) at a point P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just inside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of charges is called _conduction current_. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a new term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric _displacement_, an old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called _displacement current_ or Maxwell's displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric and magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.

The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source of a magnetic field is not _just_ the conduction electric current due to flowing

Figure 8.1: A parallel plate capacitor C, as part of a circuit through which a time dependent current (0 flows, (a) a loop of radius \(r\), to determine magnetic field at a point P on the loop; (b) a pot-shaped surface passing through the interior between the capacitor plates with the loop shown in (a) as its rim; (c) a tiffin-shaped surface with the circular loop as its rim and a flat between the capacitor plates. The arrows show uniform electric field between the capacitor plates.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:679]

a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic field. Thus, time- dependent electrtic and magnetic fields give rise to each other Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current being the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we discuss qualitatively in the next section.

**Example 8.1** A parallel plate capacitor with circular plates of radius 1 m has a capacitance of 1 nF. At \(t=0\). it is connected for charging in series with a resistor \(R=1\) M\(\Omega\) across a 2V battery (Fig. 8.3). Calculate the magnetic field at a point P, halfway between the centre and the periphery of the plates, after \(t=10^{-3}\) s. (The charge on the capacitor at time \(t\) is \(q\) (\(t=CV\) [1 - exp [-\(t/t\)]], where the time constant \(t\) is equal to CR.)

**Solution** The time constant of the _CR_ circuit is \(\tau=CR=10^{-3}\) s. Then, we have

\(q(t)=CV\) [1 - exp [-\(t/t\)]]

\(=2\times 10^{-9}\) [1 - exp [-\(t/10^{-3}\)]]

The electric field in between the plates at time \(t\) is

\(E=\frac{q(t)}{\varepsilon_{0}A}=\frac{q}{\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\) ; \(A=\pi\) (1)\({}^{2}\) m\({}^{2}=\) area of the plates.

Consider now a circular loop of radius (1/2) m parallel to the plates passing through P. The magnetic field **B** at all points on the loop is along the loop and of the same value.

The flux \(\Phi_{\mathrm{E}}\) through this loop is

\(\Phi_{\mathrm{E}}=E\times\mathrm{area}\) of the loop

\(\mathrm{E}\times\pi\times\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{\pi E}{4}=\frac{q} {4\,\epsilon_{0}}\)

The displacement current

\(\dot{t}_{a}=\epsilon_{0}\frac{\mathrm{d}\,\Phi_{\mathrm{E}}}{\mathrm{d}t}= \frac{1}{4}\frac{\mathrm{d}\,q}{\mathrm{d}t}=0.5\times 10^{-6}\exp(-1)\)

at \(t=10^{3}\mathrm{s}\). Now, applying Ampere-Maxwell law to the loop, we get

\(B\times 2\pi\times\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\mu_{0}\left(t_{+}+t_{a}\right)=\mu _{0}\left(0+t_{a}\right)=0.5\times 10^{-6}\ \mu_{0}\exp(-1)\)

or, \(B=0.74\times 10^{-13}\mathrm{T}\)

### 8.3 Electromagnetic Waves

#### Sources of electromagnetic waves

How are electromagnetic waves produced? Neither stationary charges nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time. It is an important result of Maxwell's theory that accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond the scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough, qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency. (An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.) This produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source - the accelerated charge.

From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not possible. The frequency of yellow light is about \(6\times 10^{14}\ \mathrm{Hz}\), while the frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about \(10^{11}\ \mathrm{Hz}\). This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic wave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as in the Hertz's experiment (1887).

Hertz's successful experimental test of Maxwell's theory created a sensation and sparked off other important works in this field. Two important achievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven years after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at Calcutta (now Kolkata),succeeded in producing and observing electromagnetic waves of much shorter wavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that of Hertz's, was confined to the laboratory.

At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy followed Hertz's work and succeeded in transmitting electromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres. Marconi's experiment marks the beginning of the field of communication using electromagnetic waves.

#### 8.3.2 Nature of electromagnetic waves

It can be shown from Maxwell's equations that electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other, _and_ to the direction of propagation. It appears reasonable, say from our discussion of the displacement current. Consider Fig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor is directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic field this gives rise to via the displacement current is along the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor plates. So **B** and **E** are perpendicular in this case. This is a general feature.

In Fig. 8.4, we show a typical example of a plane electromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction (the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at a given time \(\vartheta\). The electric field \(E_{x}\) is along the x-axis, and varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The magnetic field \(B_{y}\) is along the y-axis, and again varies sinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields \(E_{x}\) and \(B_{y}\) are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction z of propagation. We can write \(E_{x}\) and \(B_{y}\) as follows:

\(E_{y}\)= \(E_{0}\) sin (kz-ot) [8.7(a)] \(B_{y}\)= \(B_{0}\) sin (kz-ot) [8.7(b)] Here k is related to the wave length \(\lambda\) of the wave by the usual equation

\(k\)= \(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\) (8.8)

and \(\omega\)is the angular frequency. k is the magnitude of the wave vector (or propagation vector) **k** and its direction describes the direction of propagation of the wave. The speed of propagation of the wave is (\(\omega/k\)). Using Eqs. [8.7(a) and (b)] for \(E_{x}\) and \(B_{y}\) and Maxwell's equations, one finds that

Figure 8.4: A linearly polarised electromagnetic wave, propagating in the z-direction with the oscillating electric field **E** along the x-direction and the oscillating magnetic field **B** along the y-direction.

Physics

\(\omega\)= \(ck\), where, \(c\) = 1/ \(\sqrt{\mu_{0}\varepsilon_{0}}\) [8.9(a)]

The relation \(\omega\) = \(ck\) is the standard one for waves (see for example, Section 15.4 of class XI Physics textbook). This relation is often written in terms of frequency, \(v\) (=\(\omega/2\pi\)) and wavelength, \(\lambda\) (=2\(\pi\)/k) as

\(2\pi\nu=c\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)\) or

\(\nu\lambda=c\) [8.9(b)]

It is also seen from Maxwell's equations that the magnitude of the electric and the magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are related as

\[B_{0}=(E_{0}/c) \tag{8.10}\]

We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves. They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields in free space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have studied so far, in respect that _no material medium_ is involved in the vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves of compression and rarefaction. Transverse waves on the surface of water consist of water moving up and down as the wave spreads horizontally and radially onwards. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can also propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists in the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture that they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space and all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any elastic medium does. They called this medium _ether_. They were so convinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called _The Poison Belt_ by _Sir Arthur Conan Doyle_ (the creator of the famous detective _Sherlock Holmes_) where the solar system is supposed to pass through a poisonous region of ether We now accept that no such physical medium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in 1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and magnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in vacuum.

But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light, an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a medium are described in terms of a permittivity \(\varepsilon\) and a magnetic permeability \(\mu\) (these describe the factors by which the total fields differ from the external fields). These replace \(\varepsilon_{0}\) and \(\mu_{0}\) in the description to electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations with the result that in a material medium of permittivity \(\varepsilon\) and magnetic permeability \(\mu\), the velocity of light becomes,

\[v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}} \tag{8.11}\]

Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the _refractive index_ of one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of light in the two media.

The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the same (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out of a value of 3\(\times 10^{8}\) m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in vacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is so well known now that this is used to define a standard of _length_. Namely, the metre is now _defined_ as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in a time (1/\(c\)) seconds = (2.99792458 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\))\({}^{-1}\) seconds. This has come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be defined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency of light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length is harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of \(c\) using earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about 2.9979246 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\) m/s. Since \(c\) is such a strongly fixed number, unit of length can be defined in terms of \(c\) and the unit of time!

Hertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times that of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus, he conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he produced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their wavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes. Since the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency of the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula \(v=v\lambda\) and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the speed of light.

The fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen in the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an AM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the signal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly diminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside the case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to receive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation of the radio with respect to the station.

Do electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other waves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free space with electric field \(E\), there is an energy density (\(e_{\varphi}E^{2}/2\)). Similarly, as seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field \(B\) is a magnetic energy density (\(B^{2}/2\mu_{0}\)). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric and magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with it. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric charges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire energy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that an electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum. Since it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure, called _radiation pressure_.

If the total energy transferred to a surface in time \(t\) is \(U\), it can be shown that the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (_for complete absorption_) is,

\[p=\frac{U}{c} \tag{8.12}\]Physics

When the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being absorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm). Electromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but because \(c\)is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely small and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists Nicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of visible light and verified Eq. (8.12). It was found to be of the order of \(7\times 10^{-6}\) N/m\({}^{2}\). Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm\({}^{2}\), the force due to radiation is only about \(7\times 10^{-9}\) N.

The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on the earth.

**Example 8.2**: A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency 25 MHz travels in free space along the \(x\)-direction. At a particular point in space and time, \(\mathbf{E}=6.3\;\;\mathbf{j}\) V/m. What is \(\mathbf{B}\) at this point?

**Solution** Using Eq. (8.10), the magnitude of \(\mathbf{B}\) is

\[B =\frac{E}{c}\] \[=\frac{6.3\,\mathrm{V/m}}{3\times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{m/s}} =2.1\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{T}\]

To find the direction, we note that \(\mathbf{E}\) is along \(y\)-direction and the wave propagates along \(x\)-axis. Therefore, \(\mathbf{B}\) should be in a direction perpendicular to both \(x\) and \(y\)-axes. Using vector algebra, \(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\) should be along \(x\)-direction. Since, \(\left\{\cdot\right\}\times\left\{\cdot\right\}\times\left\{\cdot\right\}= \mathbf{i}\;\), \(\mathbf{B}\) is along the z-direction. Thus, \(\mathbf{B}=2.1\times 10^{-8}\;\mathbf{\hat{K}}\;\)T

**Example 8.3**: The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave is given by \(B_{y}=2\times 10^{-7}\) sin (\(0.5\times 10^{3}\times 1.5\times 10^{11}\)t) T.

(a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?

(b) Write an expression for the electric field.

**Solution**

(a) Comparing the given equation with

\[B_{y}=B_{0}\sin\left[2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}+\frac{t}{T}\right)\right]\]

We get, \(\lambda=\frac{2\pi}{0.5\times 10^{3}}\) m = 1.26 cm,

and \(\frac{1}{T}=v=\left(1.5\times 10^{11}\right)/2\pi=23.9\) GHz

(b) \(E_{0}=B_{0}c=2\times 10^{-7}\) T \(\times 3\times 10^{8}\) m/s = 6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{1}\) V/m

The electric field component is perpendicular to the direction of propagation and the direction of magnetic field. Therefore, the electric field component along the z-axis is obtained as

\(E_{x}=60\) sin (\(0.5\times 10^{3}\times\)\(1.5\times 10^{11}\) t) V/m

**Example 8.4**: Light with an energy flux of 18 W/cm\({}^{2}\) falls on a non-reflecting surface at normal incidence. If the surface has an area of 20 cm\({}^{2}\), find the average force exerted on the surface during a 30 minute time span.

**Solution**

The total energy falling on the surface is

\(U=(18\) W/cm\({}^{2})\times(20\) cm\({}^{2})\times(30\times 60)\)

\(=6.48\times 10^{5}\) J

Therefore, the total momentum delivered (for complete absorption) is

\(p=\frac{U}{c}=\frac{6.48\times 10^{5}\text{J}}{3\times 10^{8}\text{m/s}}=2.16 \times 10^{-3}\) kg m/s

The average force exerted on the surface is

\(F=\frac{P}{t}=\frac{2.16\times 10^{-3}}{0.18\times 10^{4}}=1.2\times 10^{-6}\)N

How will your result be modified if the surface is a perfect reflector?

**Example 8.5**: Calculate the electric and magnetic fields produced by the radiation coming from a 100 W bulb at a distance of 3 m. Assume that the efficiency of the bulb is 2.5% and it is a point source.

**Solution** The bulb, as a point source, radiates light in all directions uniformly. At a distance of 3 m, the surface area of the surrounding sphere is

\(A=4\pi r^{2}=4\pi(3)^{2}=113\) m\({}^{2}\)

The intensity at this distance is

\(I=\frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}=\frac{100\text{W}\times 2.5\%}{113\, \text{m}^{2}}\)

\(=0.022\) W/m\({}^{2}\)

Half of this intensity is provided by the electric field and half by the magnetic field.

\(\frac{1}{2}I=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\kappa_{0}E_{\text{rms}}^{2}c\big{)}\)

\(=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}0.022\) W/m\({}^{2}\big{)}\)

\(E_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\big{(}8.85\times 10^{-12}\big{)}\big{(}3\times 10^{8} \big{)}}\) V/m

\(=2.9\) V/m

The value of \(E\) found above is the root mean square value of the electric field. Since the electric field in a light beam is sinusoidal, the peak electric field, \(E_{0}\) is

\(E_{0}=\sqrt{2}E_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{2}\times 2.9\) V/m

\(=4.07\) V/m

Thus, you see that the electric field strength of the light that you use for reading is fairly large. Compare it with electric field strength of TV or FM waves, which is of the order of a few microrovts per metre.

Physics

Now, let us calculate the strength of the magnetic field. It is

\[B_{\mathrm{rms}}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{rms}}}{c}=\frac{2.9\ \ \mathrm{V\,m^{-1}}}{3 \times 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}}=9.6\times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{T}\]

Again, since the field in the light beam is sinusoidal, the peak magnetic field is \(B_{0}=\sqrt{2}\ \ B_{\mathrm{rms}}=1.4\ \times 10^{-8}\ \ \mathrm{T}\). Note that although the energy in the magnetic field is equal to the energy in the electric field, the magnetic field strength is evidently very weak.

### 8.4 Electromagnetic Spectrum

At the time Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, the only familiar electromagnetic waves were the visible light waves. The existence of ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the nineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered. We now know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The classification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 8.5). _There is no sharp division between one kind of wave and the next._ The classification is based roughly on how the waves are produced and/or detected.

Figure 8.5: The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various part of it. The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries.

We briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in order of decreasing wavelengths.

#### 8.4.1 Radio waves

Radio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting wires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. They are generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz. The AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher frequencies upto 54 MHz are used for _short wave_ bands. TV waves range from 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band extends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to transmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency [UHF] band. How these waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.

#### 8.4.2 Microwaves

Microwaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the gigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called klystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths, they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar also provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, temserves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic application of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that energy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of the molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.

Microwave over

The spectrum of _electromagnetic radiation_ contains a part known as _microuxes_. These waves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it. What is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work?

Our objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that a certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of the random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or rotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 300 crore hertz, which is 3 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this energy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.

One should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because of the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt from heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large molecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb microwaves. Hence, they do not get heated up.

Thus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of appropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way energy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel on the burmer gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of energy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly delivered to water molecules which is shared by the entire food.

#### 8.4.3 Infrared waves

Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band lies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible spectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as _heat waves_. This is because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb infrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{3}\), also absorb infrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is, they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in physical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in maintaining the earth's warmth or average temperature through the greenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily through the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth's surface and re-radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour. Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes and to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example semiconductor light emitting diodes) also emit infrared and are widely used in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV sets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.

#### 8.4.4 Visible rays

It is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the spectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about \(4\times 10^{14}\) Hz to about \(7\times 10^{14}\) Hz or a wavelength range of about \(700-400\) nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides us information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of wavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of wavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the 'visible' range of many insects extends well into the ultraviolet.

#### 8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays

It covers wavelengths ranging from about \(4\times 10^{-7}\) m (400 nm) down to \(6\times 10^{-10}\)m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special lamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet light. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the atmosphere at an altitude of about \(40-50\) km. UV light in large quantities has harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the production of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is absorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn through glass windows.

Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows to protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs. Due to its shorter wavelengths, UV radiations can be focussed into very narrow beams for high precision applications such as LASIK (_Laser-assisted in situ keratomleusis_) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill germs in water purifiers.

Ozone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter of international concern.

#### 8.4.6 X-rays

Beyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray region. We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. It covers wavelengths from about 10\({}^{-8}\) m (10 nm) down to 10\({}^{-13}\) m (10\({}^{-4}\) nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal target by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to avoid unnecessary or over exposure.

#### 8.4.7 Gamma rays

They lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum and have wavelengths of from about 10\({}^{-10}\)m to less than 10\({}^{-14}\)m. This high frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and also emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy cancer cells.

Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their production and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation between different region is not sharp and there are over laps.

names; \(\gamma\)-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength from 10\({}^{-3}\) A or 10\({}^{-12}\)m to 10\({}^{6}\)m.

They interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set in oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and so the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules in the medium.

## 8 Points to Ponder

1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves lies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through vacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ considerably in their mode of interaction with matter.
2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the characteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation, having wavelength of 10\({}^{14}\) m to 10\({}^{-15}\) m, typically originate from an atomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves are produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting antenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of about the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms is, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.
3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges and can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed to detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original'receiver worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised in practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency electromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the physical effects they produce on interacting with matter.
4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light, vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a substance. This vibration increases the internal energy and consequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared waves are often called _heat waves_.
5. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the wavelength distribution of the sum. It is because humans have evolved with visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from the sun.

## 9 Exercises

### 9.1 Introduction

Nature has endowed the human eye (retina) with the sensitivity to detect electromagnetic waves within a small range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the spectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is mainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret the world around us.

There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that the speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value in vacuum is \(c=2.99792458\times 10^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\). For many purposes, it suffices to take \(c=3\times 10^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\). The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature.

The intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to contradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an electromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the spectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects that we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger). In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joiningthem. The path is called a _rau_ of light, and a bundle of such rays constitutes a _beam_ of light.

In this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction and dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic laws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by plane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to describe the construction and working of some important optical instruments, including the human eye.

### 9.2 Reflection of Light by Spherical Mirrors

We are familiar with the laws of reflection. The angle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface or the mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and the normal). Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface whether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the special case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case is to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface at the point of incidence. That is, the normal is along the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to the point of incidence.

We have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror is called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre. The line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror is known as the _principal axis_. In the case of spherical lenses, the principal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus as you will see later.

#### 9.2.1 Sign convention

To derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and refraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for measuring distances. In this book, we shall follow the _Cartesian sign convention_. According to this convention, all distances are measured from the pole of the mirror or the optical centre of the lens. The distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are taken as positive and those measured in the direction opposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured upwards with respect to \(x\)-axis and normal to the

Figure 9.1: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface lie in the same plane.

Figure 9.2: The Cartesian Sign Convention.

principal axis (\(\chi\)-axis) of the mirror/lens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured downwards are taken as negative.

With a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula for spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle all different cases.

#### 9.2.2 Focal length of spherical mirrors

Figure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident on (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays are _paraxial_, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror and make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge at a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)]. For a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F on its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the _principal focus_ of the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making some angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or appear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal axis. This is called the _focal plane_ of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].

The distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called the _focal length_ of the mirror, denoted by \(f\). We now show that _f_\(=R/2\), where \(R\) is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry of reflection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.

Let C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a ray parallel to the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then CM will be perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let \(\theta\) be the angle of incidence, and MD

Figure 9.3: Focus of a concave and convex mirror.

be the perpendicular from M on the principal axis. Then,

\(\angle\)MCP = \(\theta\) and \(\angle\)MFP = 2 \(\theta\)

Now,

\(\tan\theta\) = \(\frac{\cdot\text{MD}}{\text{CD}}\) and \(\tan\) 2 \(\theta\) = \(\frac{\cdot\text{MD}}{\text{FD}}\)

For small \(\theta\), which is true for paraxial rays, \(\tan\theta\approx\theta\), \(\tan\) 2 \(\theta\) \(\approx\) 2 \(\theta\). Therefore, Eq. (9.1) gives

\(\frac{\cdot\text{MD}}{\text{FD}}=2\)\(\frac{\cdot\text{MD}}{\text{CD}}\)

or, FD = \(\frac{\cdot\text{CD}}{2}\)

Now, for small \(\theta\), the point D is very close to the point P. Therefore, FD = \(f\)and CD = \(R\). Equation (9.2) then gives

\(f\) = \(R/2\)

#### 9.2.3 The mirror equation

If rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point after reflection and/or refraction, that point is called the _image_ of the first point. The image is _real_ if the rays actually converge to the point; it is _virtual_ if the rays do not actually meet but appear to diverge from the point when produced backwards. An image is thus a point-to-point correspondence with the object established through reflection and/or refraction.

In principle, we can take any two rays emanating from a point on an object, trace their paths, find their point of intersection and thus, obtain the image of the point due to reflection at a spherical mirror. In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two of the following rays:

The ray from the point which is parallel to the principal axis. The reflected ray goes through the focus of the mirror.

The ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a convex mirror. The reflected ray simply retraces the path.

The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave mirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus of a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.

The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows laws of reflection.

Figure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows the image A'B' (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave mirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions. Thus, point A' is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and falling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A'.

Figure 9.4: Geometry of reflection of an incident ray on (a) concave spherical mirror, and (b) convex spherical mirror.

We now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object distance (\(u\)), image distance (\(v\)) and the focal length (\(f\)).

From Fig. 9.5, the two right-angled triangles A'B'F and MPF are similar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line perpendicular to CP.) Therefore,

\[\frac{\text{'B'A'}}{\text{PM}} = \frac{\text{B'F}}{\text{FP}}\] \[\text{or}\ \frac{\text{'B'A'}}{\text{BA}} = \frac{\text{B'F}}{\text{FP}}\ \{\text{:}\cdot\text{PM}=\text{AB}\} \tag{9.4}\]

Since \(\angle\) APB = \(\angle\) A'PB', the right angled triangles A'B'P and ABP are also similar. Therefore,

\[\frac{\text{'B'A'}}{\text{BA}} = \frac{\text{B'P}}{\text{BP}} \tag{9.5}\]

Comparing Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5), we get

\[\frac{\text{'B'F}}{\text{FP}} = \frac{\text{B'P}-\text{FP}}{\text{FP}} = \frac{\text{B'P}}{\text{BP}} \tag{9.6}\]

Equation (9.6) is a relation involving magnitude of distances. We now apply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to the mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction, To reach the object AB, image A'B' as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have to travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three will have negative signs. Thus,

\(\text{B'P}=-v\), FP = -\(f\), BP = \(-u\)

Using these in Eq. (9.6), we get

\[\frac{\text{'-v}+f}{\text{'-f}} = \frac{-v}{-u}\] or \[\frac{v-f}{f} = \frac{v}{u}\] \[\frac{v}{f} = 1+\frac{v}{u}\]

Dividing it by \(v\), we get

\[\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f} \tag{9.7}\]

This relation is known as the _mirror equation_.

The size of the image relative to the size of the object is another important quantity to consider. We define linear _magnification_ (\(m\)) as the ratio of the height of the image (\(h\)) to the height of the object (\(h\)):

\[m=\frac{h^{\prime}}{h} \tag{9.8}\]

\(h\) and \(h^{\prime}\) will be taken positive or negative in accordance with the accepted sign convention. In triangles A'BP and ABP, we have,

\[\frac{\text{'B'A'}}{\text{BA}} = \frac{\text{B'P}}{\text{BP}}\]

With the sign convention, this becomes \[\frac{-h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{-v}{-u}\]

so that

\[m=\frac{\cdot\cdot\cdot}{h}=-\frac{v}{u} \tag{9.9}\]

We have derived here the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), and the magnification formula, Eq. (9.9), for the case of real, inverted image formed by a concave mirror. With the proper use of sign convention, these are, in fact, valid for all the cases of reflection by a spherical mirror (concave or convex) whether the image formed is real or virtual. Figure 9.6 shows the ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror. You should verify that Eqs. (9.7) and (9.9) are valid for these cases as well.

**Example 9.1** Suppose that the lower half of the concave mirror's reflecting surface in Fig. 9,6 is covered with an opaque (non-reflective) material. What effect will this have on the image of an object placed in front of the mirror?

**Solution** You may think that the image will now show only half of the object, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the remaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object. However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the intensity of the image will be low (in this case, half).

**Example 9.2** A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave mirror, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Show by suitable diagram, the formation of its image. Explain why the magnification is not uniform. Will the distortion of image depend on the location of the phone with respect to the mirror?

**Solution**

The ray diagram for the formation of the image of the phone is shown in Fig. 9.7. The image of the part which is on the plane perpendicular to principal axis will be on the same plane. It will be of the same size, i.e., B'C = BC. You can yourself realise why the image is distorted.

**Example 9.3**: An object is placed at (i) 10 cm, (ii) 5 cm in front of a concave mirror of radius of curvature 15 cm. Find the position, nature, and magnification of the image in each case.

**Solution**

The focal length \(f=-15/2\) cm = -7.5 cm

(ii) The object distance \(u=-10\) cm. Then Eq. (9.7) gives

\(\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{-10}=\frac{1}{-7.5}\)

or \(v-\frac{10\times 7.5}{-2.5}=-30\) cm

The image is 30 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object.

Also, magnification \(m=-\frac{v}{u}=-\frac{(-30)}{(-10)}=3\)

The image is magnified, real and inverted.

(iii) The object distance \(u\) = -5 cm. Then from Eq. (9.7),

\(\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{-5}=-\frac{1}{7.5}\)

or \(v-\frac{5\times 7.5}{(7.5-5)}=15\) cm

This image is formed at 15 cm behind the mirror. It is a virtual image.

Magnification \(m=-\frac{v}{u}=-\frac{15}{(-5)}=3\)

The image is magnified, virtual and erect.

**Example 9.4**: Suppose while sitting in a parked car, you notice a jogger approaching towards you in the side view mirror of \(R=2\) m. If the jogger is running at a speed of 5 m s\({}^{-1}\), how fast the image of the jogger appear to move when the jogger is (a) 39 m, (b) 29 m, (c) 19 m, and (d) 9 m away.

**Solution**

From the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), we get

\(v=\frac{fu}{u-f}\)

For convex mirror, since \(R=2\) m, \(f=1\) m. Then

for \(u=-39\) m, \(v=\frac{(-39)\times 1}{-39-1}=\frac{39}{40}\)m

Since the jogger moves at a constant speed of 5 m s\({}^{-1}\), after 1 s the position of the image \(v\) (for \(u=-39\) + 5 = -34) is (34/35) m.

The shift in the position of image in 1 s is

\[\frac{39}{40}-\frac{34}{35}=\frac{1365-1360}{1400}=\frac{5}{1400}=\frac{1}{280} \mathbf{m}\]

Therefore, the average speed of the image when the jogger is between 39 m and 34 m from the mirror, is (1/280) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Similarly, it can be seen that for \(u=-29\) m, \(-19\) m and \(-9\) m, the speed with which the image appears to move is

\[\frac{1}{150}\,\mathbf{m}\,\mathbf{s}^{-1},\frac{1}{60}\,\mathbf{m}\,\mathbf{s }^{-1}\,\text{and}\,\frac{1}{10}\,\mathbf{m}\,\mathbf{s}^{-1},\text{ respectively.}\]

Although the jogger has been moving with a constant speed, the speed of his/her image appears to increase substantially as he/she moves closer to the mirror. This phenomenon can be noticed by any person sitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a similar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is moving closer with a constant speed.

### 8.3 Refraction

When a beam of light encounters another transparent medium, a part of light gets reflected back into the first medium while the rest enters the other. A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an obliquely incident (\(0^{\circ}\!<\!l\!<90^{\circ}\)) ray of light that enters the other medium, changes at the interface of the two media. This phenomenon is called _refraction of light_. Snell experimentally obtained the following laws of refraction:

The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.

The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant. Remember that the angles of incidence (\(i\)) and refraction (\(r\)) are the angles that the incident and its refracted ray make with the normal, respectively. We have

\[\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}=n_{21} \tag{9.10}\]

where \(n_{21}\) is a constant, called the _refractive index_ of the second medium with respect to the first medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known Snell's law of refraction. We note that \(n_{21}\) is a characteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength of light), but is independent of the angle of incidence.

From Eq. (9.10), if \(n_{21}>1\), \(r<i\), i.e., the refracted ray bends towards the normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be _optically denser_ (or _denser_, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if \(n_{21}<1\), \(r>i\), the

Figure 9.8: Refraction and reflection of light.

refracted ray bends away from the normal. This is the case when incident ray in a denser medium refracts into a rarer medium.

**Note:**_Optical density should not be confused with mass density, which is mass per unit volume. It is possible that mass density of an optically denser medium may be less than that of an optically rarer medium (optical density is the ratio of the speed of light in two media). For example, turpentine and water. Mass density of turpentine is less than that of water but its optical density is higher._

If \(n_{{}_{21}}\) is the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 and \(n_{{}_{12}}\) the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it should be clear that

\[n_{{}_{12}}= \frac{1}{n_{{}_{21}}} \tag{9.11}\]

It also follows that if \(n_{{}_{32}}\) is the refractive index of medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then \(n_{{}_{32}}=n_{{}_{31}}\times\ n_{{}_{12}}\), where \(n_{{}_{31}}\) is the refractive index of medium 3 with respect to medium 1.

Some elementary results based on the laws of refraction follow immediately. For a rectangular slab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-glass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9 that \(r_{{}_{2}}=i_{{}_{1}}\), i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray--there is no deviation; but it does suffer lateral displacement/shift with respect to the incident ray. Another familiar observation is that the bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be raised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing near the normal direction, it can be shown that the apparent depth (\(h_{{}_{1}}\)) is real depth (\(h_{{}_{2}}\)) divided by the refractive index of the medium (water).

### 9.4 Total, Internal Reflection

When light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium at the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and partly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the _internal reflection_.

When a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO\({}_{{}_{1}}\)B in Fig. 9.11. The incident ray AO\({}_{{}_{1}}\)is partially reflected (O\({}_{{}_{1}}\)C) and partially transmitted (O\({}_{{}_{1}}\)B) or refracted, the angle of refraction (\(r\)) being larger than the angle of incidence (\(i\)). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of

Figure 9.10: Apparent depth for (a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing.

Figure 9.9: Lateral shift of a ray refracted through a parallel-sided slab.

no transmission of light takes place.

The angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90\({}^{\circ}\), say \(\angle\)AO\({}_{3}\)N, is called the _critical angle_ (\(t\), ) for the given pair of media. We see from Snell's law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the refracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of \(\sin\)\(r\) is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of \(\sin\)\(t\) for which the law can be satisfied, that is, \(t=t_{c}\) such that

\[\sin\,t_{c}=n_{21} \tag{9.12}\]

For values of \(t\) larger than \(t_{c}\) Snell's law of refraction cannot be satisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.

The refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium 2 will be \(n_{12}=1/\sin\,t_{c}\) Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.

### A demonstration for total internal reflection

All optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a laser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays. Take a glass beaker with clear water in it. Add a few drops of milk or any other suspension to water and stir so that water becomes a little turbid. Take a laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water. You will find that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly.

Figure 9.11: Refraction and internal reflection of rays from a point A in the denser medium (water) incident at different angles at the interface with a rarer medium (air).

Shine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the upper water surface at the other end. Do you find that it undergoes partial reflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction [which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.12(a)]? Now direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes the upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.12(b)]. Adjust the direction of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction above the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected back to water. This is total internal reflection at its simplest.

Pour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top, as shown in Fig. 9.12(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that it is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube. This is similar to what happens in optical fibres.

Take care not to look into the laser beam directly and not to point it at anybody's face.

#### 9.4.1 Total internal reflection in nature and its technological applications

1. [label=()]
2. _Prism_: Prisms designed to bend light by 90 or by 180 make use of total internal reflection [Fig. 9.13(a) and.(b)]. Such a prism is also used to invert images without changing their size [Fig. 9.13(e)]. In the first two cases, the critical angle \(I_{i}\) for the material of the prism must be less than 45. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both crown glass and dense flint glass.
3. _Optical fibres_: Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for transmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical fibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection. Optical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz fibres. Each fibre consists of a core and cladding. The refractive index of the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding. When a signal in the form of light is directed at one end of the fibre at a suitable angle, it undergoes repeated total internal reflections along the length of the fibre and finally comes out at the other end (Fig. 9.14). Since light undergoes total internal reflection at each stage, there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light signal. Optical fibres are fabricated such that light reflected at one side of inner surface strikes the other at an angle larger than the critical angle. Even if the fibre is bent, light can easily travel along its length. Thus, an optical fibre can be used to act as an optical pipe.

A bundle of optical fibres can be put to several uses. Optical fibres are extensively used for transmitting and receiving

lump is switched on, the light travels from the bottom of each fibre and appears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light. The fibres in such decorative lamps are optical fibres.

The main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should be very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside them. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of materials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit more than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km. (Compare with what you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)

### 9.5 Refraction at Spherical Surfaces and by Lenses

We have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now consider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media. An infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar and the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the surface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the point of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical surface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of curvature. We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker's formula and then the lens formula.

#### 9.5.1 Refraction at a spherical surface

Figure 9.15 shows the geometry of formation of image \(I\) of an object \(O\) on the principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature \(C\), and radius of curvature \(R\). The rays are incident from a medium of refractive index \(n_{1}\), to another of refractive index \(n_{2}\). As before, we take the aperture (or the lateral size) of the surface to be small compared to other distances involved, so that small angle approximation can be made. In particular, NM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular from the point N on the principal axis. We have, for small angles,

\[\tan\angle\text{NOM}=\frac{\text{`MN}}{\text{OM}}\]

Figure 9.14: Light undergoes successive total internal reflections as it moves through an optical fibre.

\[\tan\angle\text{NCM}=\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{MC}}\]

\[\tan\angle\text{NIM}=\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{MI}}\]

Now, for \(\Delta\text{NOC}\), \(t\) is the exterior angle. Therefore, \(t\) = \(\angle\text{NOM}+\angle\text{NCM}\)

\[i=\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{OM}}+\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{MC}} \tag{9.13}\]

Similarly,

\[r=\angle\text{NCM}-\angle\text{NIM}\]

i.e., \(r=\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{MC}}-\frac{\text{MN}}{\text{MI}}\)

Now, by Snell's law

\(n_{1}\sin i=n_{2}\sin r\)

or for small angles

\(n_{1}i=n_{2}r\)

Substituting \(i\) and \(r\) from Eqs. (9.13) and (9.14), we get

\[\frac{n_{1}}{\text{OM}}+\frac{n_{2}}{\text{MI}}=\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{\text{MC}} \tag{9.15}\]

Here, OM, MI and MC represent magnitudes of distances. Applying the Cartesian sign convention,

\[\text{OM}=-u,\text{ MI}=+v,\text{ MC}=+R\]

Substituting these in Eq. (9.15), we get

\[\frac{n_{2}}{v}-\frac{n_{1}}{u}=\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{R} \tag{9.16}\]

Equation (9.16) gives us a relation between object and image distance in terms of refractive index of the medium and the radius of curvature of the curved spherical surface. It holds for any curved spherical surface.

**Example 9.5**: Light from a point source in air falls on a spherical glass surface (\(n=1.5\) and radius of curvature = 20 cm). The distance of the light source from the glass surface is 100 cm. At what position the image is formed?

**Solution**

We use the relation given by Eq. (9.16). Here

\(u=-100\) cm, \(v=?\), \(R=+20\) cm, \(n_{1}=1\), and \(n_{2}=1.5\).

We then have

\[\frac{1.5}{v}+\frac{1}{100}=\frac{0.5}{20}\]

or

\[v=+100\]

The image is formed at a distance of 100 cm from the glass surface, in the direction of incident light.

#### 9.5.2 Refraction by a lens

Figure 9.16(a) shows the geometry of image formation by a double convex lens. The image formation can be seen in terms of two steps: (i) The first refracting surface forms the image I\({}_{1}\) of the object O [Fig. 9.16(b)]. The image I\({}_{1}\) acts as a virtual object for the second surface that forms the image at I [Fig. 9.16(c)]. Applying Eq. (9.15) to the first interface ABC, we get

\[\frac{n_{1}}{\text{OB}}+\frac{n_{2}}{\text{BI}_{1}}=\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{\text{BC} _{1}} \tag{9.17}\]

A similar procedure applied to the second interface* ADC gives,

\[-\frac{n_{2}}{\text{DI}_{1}}+\frac{n_{1}}{\text{DI}}=\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{\text{ DC}_{2}} \tag{9.18}\]

For a thin lens, BI\({}_{1}\) = DI\({}_{1}\). Adding Eqs. (9.17) and (9.18), we get

\[\frac{n_{1}}{\text{OB}}+\frac{n_{1}}{\text{DI}}=(n_{2}-n_{1})\left(\frac{1}{ \text{BC}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\text{DC}_{2}}\right) \tag{9.19}\]

Suppose the object is at infinity, i.e., OB \(\rightarrow\infty\) and DI = \(f\). Eq. (9.19) gives

\[\frac{n_{1}}{\text{BC}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\text{DC}_{2}} \tag{9.20}\]

The point where image of an object placed at infinity is formed is called the _focus_ F, of the lens and the distance \(f\) gives its _focal length_. A lens has two foci, F and F', on either side of it (Fig. 9.17). By the sign convention,

\[\text{BC}_{1}=+\,R_{1},\]

\[\text{DC}_{2}=-R_{2}\]

So Eq. (9.20) can be written as

\[\frac{1}{f}=\left(n_{21}-1\right)\left[\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right] \leavevmode\nobreak\ \leavevmode\nobreak\ \left[\because\leavevmode\nobreak\ n_{21}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\right] \tag{9.21}\]

Equation (9.21) is known as the _lens maker_'s _formula_. It is useful to design lenses of desired focal length using surfaces of suitable radii of curvature. Note that the formula is true for a concave lens also. In that case \(R_{1}\)is negative, \(R_{2}\) positive and therefore, \(f\)is negative.

Figure 9.16: (a) The position of object, and the image formed by a double convex lens, (b) Refraction at the first spherical surface and (c) Refraction at the second spherical surface.

From Eqs. (9.19) and (9.20), we get

\[\frac{n_{1}}{\text{OB}}+\frac{n_{1}}{\text{DI}}=\frac{n_{1}}{f} \tag{9.22}\]

Again, in the thin lens approximation, B and D are both close to the optical centre of the lens. Applying the sign convention,

BO = \(-\,u\), DI = \(+v\), we get

\[\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f} \tag{9.23}\]

Equation (9.23) is the familiar _thin lens formula_. Though we derived it for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both convex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.

It is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F', of a double convex or concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the side of the (original) source of light is called the _first focal point_, whereas the other is called the _second focal point_.

To find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any two rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using the laws of refraction and find the point where the refracted rays meet (or appear to meet). In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two of the following rays:

1. A ray emanating from the object parallel to the principal axis of the lens after refraction passes through the second principal focus F' (in a convex lens) or appears to diverge (in a concave lens) from the first principal focus F.
2. A ray of light, passing through the optical centre of the lens, emerges without any deviation after refraction.
3. A ray of light passing through the first principal focus of a convex lens [Fig. 9.17(a)] emerges parallel to the principal axis after refraction.

(b) A ray of light incident on a concave lens appearing to meet the principal axis at second focus point emerges parallel to the principal axis after refraction [Fig. 9.17(b)].

Figures 9.17(a) and (b) illustrate these rules for a convex and a concave lens, respectively. You should practice drawing similar ray diagrams for different positions of the object with respect to the lens and also verify that the lens formula, Eq. (9.23), holds good for all cases.

Here again it must be remembered that each point on an object gives out infinite number of rays. All these rays will pass through the same image point after refraction at the lens.

Magnification (\(m\)) produced by a lens is defined, like that for a mirror, as the ratio of the size of the image to that of the object. Proceedingin the same way as for spherical mirrors, it is easily seen that for a lens

\[\text{m}=\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{\cdot}{u} \tag{9.24}\]

When we apply the sign convention, we see that, for erect (and virtual) image formed by a convex or concave lens, \(m\) is positive, while for an inverted (and real) image, \(m\) is negative.

**Example 9.6**: A magician during a show makes a glass lens with \(n=1.47\) disappear in a trough of liquid. What is the refractive index of the liquid? Could the liquid be water?

**Solution**

The refractive index of the liquid must be equal to \(1.47\) in order to make the lens disappear. This means \(n_{1}=n_{2}\). This gives \(1/f=0\) or \(f\rightarrow\infty\). The lens in the liquid will act like a plane sheet of glass. No, the liquid is not water. It could be glycerine.

#### 9.5.3 Power of a lens

Power of a lens is a measure of the convergence or divergence, which a lens introduces in the light falling on it. Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident light more, while converging it in case of a convex lens and diverging it in case of a concave lens. The _power_\(P\) of a lens is defined as the tangent of the angle by which it converges or diverges a beam of light parallel to the principal axis falling at unit distance from the optical centre (Fig. 9.18).

\[\text{tan}\delta=\frac{h}{f};\text{ if }h=1,\ \ \ \text{tan}\delta=\frac{1}{f}\ \ \ \text{or}\ \ \ \delta=\frac{1}{f}\ \ \ \text{for}\ \ \text{small}\]

\[\text{value of }\delta.\ \text{Thus}. \tag{9.25}\]

The SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m\({}^{-1}\). The power of a lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an optician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is a convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of - 4.0 D means a concave lens of focal length - 25 cm.

**Example 9.7**: (i) If \(f=0.5\) m for a glass lens, what is the power of the lens? (ii) The radii of curvature of the faces of a double convex lens are 10 cm and 15 cm. Its focal length is 12 cm. What is the refractive index of glass? (iii) A convex lens has 20 cm focal length in air. What is focal length in water? (Refractive index of air-water = 1.33, refractive index for air-glass = 1.5.)

**Solution**

1. Power = +2 dioptre.
2. Here, we have \(f\) = +12 cm, \(R_{1}\) = +10 cm, \(R_{2}\) = -15 cm.

Refractive index of air is taken as unity.

We use the lens formula of Eq. (9.22). The sign convention has to be applied for \(f\), \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\).

Substituting the values, we have

\(\frac{1}{12}\)=(\(n-1\)) \(\left(\frac{1}{10}\)-\(\frac{1}{-15}\right)\)

This gives \(n\) = 1.5.
3. For a glass lens in air, \(n_{2}\) = 1.5, \(n_{1}\) = 1, \(f\) = +20 cm. Hence, the lens formula gives

\(\frac{1}{20}\)=0.5\(\left[\frac{1}{R_{1}}\)-\(\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right]\)

For the same glass lens in water, \(n_{2}\) = 1.5, \(n_{1}\) = 1.33. Therefore,

\(\frac{1.33}{f}\)=(1.5-1.33) \(\left[\frac{1}{R_{1}}\)-\(\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right]\)

Combining these two equations, we find \(f\) = +78.2 cm.

#### 9.5.4 Combination of thin lenses in contact

Consider two lenses A and B of focal length \(f_{1}\) and \(f_{2}\) placed in contact with each other. Let the object be placed at a point O beyond the focus of the first lens A (Fig. 19). The first lens produces an image at \(I_{1}\). Since image \(I_{1}\) is real, it serves as a virtual object for the second lens B, producing the final image at I. It must, however, be borne in mind that formation of image by the first lens is presumed only to facilitate determination of the position of the final image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging from the first lens gets modified in accordance with the angle at which they strike the second lens. Since the lenses are thin, we assume the optical centres of the lenses to be coincident. Let this central point be denoted by P.

For the image formed by the first lens A, we get

\(\frac{1}{v_{1}}\)-\(\frac{1}{u}\)=\(\frac{1}{f_{1}}\) (9.27)

For the image formed by the second lens B, we get

\(\frac{1}{v}\)-\(\frac{1}{v_{1}}\)=\(\frac{1}{f_{2}}\) (9.28)

Adding Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28), we get

\(\frac{1}{v}\)-\(\frac{1}{u}\)=\(\frac{1}{f_{1}}\)+\(\frac{1}{f_{2}}\) (9.29)

If the two lens-system is regarded as equivalent to a single lens of focal length \(f\), we have

Figure 19: Image formation by a combination of two thin lenses in contact.

\[\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}\]

so that we get

\[\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{f_{1}}+\frac{1}{f_{2}} \tag{9.30}\]

The derivation is valid for any number of thin lenses in contact. If several thin lenses of focal length \(f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},...\) are in contact, the effective focal length of their combination is given by

\[\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{f_{1}}+\frac{1}{f_{2}}+\frac{1}{f_{3}}+... \tag{9.31}\]

In terms of power, Eq. (9.31) can be written as

\[P=P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3}+... \tag{9.32}\]

where \(P_{1}\) is the net power of the lens combination. Note that the sum in Eq. (9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms on the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative (for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or converging lenses of desired magnification: It also enhances sharpness of the image. Since the image formed by the first lens becomes the object for the second, Eq. (9.25) implies that the total magnification \(m\) of the combination is a product of magnification (\(m_{1}\), \(m_{2}\), \(m_{3},...\)) of individual lenses

\[m=m_{1}\frac{m_{2}}{m_{3}}... \tag{9.33}\]

Such a system of combination of lenses is commonly used in designing lenses for cameras, microscopes, telescopes and other optical instruments.

Figure 9.20: Image formed by the first lens

The image formed by the first lens serves as the object for the second. This is at a distance of (15 - 5) cm = 10 cm to the right of the second lens. Though the image is real, it serves as a virtual object for the second lens, which means that the rays appear to come from it for the second lens.

\(\frac{1}{v_{2}}-\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{-10}\)

or \(v_{2}=\infty\)

The virtual image is formed at an infinite distance to the left of the second lens. This acts as an object for the third lens.

\(\frac{1}{v_{3}}-\frac{1}{u_{3}}=\frac{1}{f_{3}}\)

or \(\frac{1}{v_{3}}=\frac{1}{\infty}+\frac{1}{30}\)

or \(v_{3}=30\) cm

The final image is formed 30 cm to the right of the third lens.

### 9.6 Refraction through a Prism

Figure 9.21 shows the passage of light through a triangular prism ABC. The angles of incidence and refraction at the first face AB are \(i\) and \(\hat{r_{1}}\), while the angle of incidence (from glass to air) at the second face AC is \(r_{2}\) and the angle of refraction or emergence \(e\). The angle between the emergent ray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ is called the _angle of deviation_, \(\delta\).

In the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles (at the vertices \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{R}\)) are right angles. Therefore, the sum of the other angles of the quadrilateral is \(180^{\circ}\).

\(\angle A+\angle\)QNR = \(180^{\circ}\)

From the triangle QNR,

\(r_{1}+r_{2}+\angle\)QNR = \(180^{\circ}\)

Comparing these two equations, we get

\(r_{1}+r_{2}=A\)

The total deviation \(\delta\) is the sum of deviations at the two faces,

\(\delta=(i-r_{1})+(e-r_{2})\)

that is,

\(\delta=i+e-A\)

Thus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot between the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in Fig. 9.22. You can see that, in general, any given value of \(\delta\), except for \(i=e\), corresponds to two values \(i\) and hence of \(e\). This, in fact, is expected from the symmetry of \(i\) and \(e\) in Eq. (9.35), i.e., \(\delta\) remains the same if and \(e\) are interchanged. Physically, this is related to the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.21 can be traced back, resulting in the same angle of deviation. At the minimum deviation \(D_{m}\), the refracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel to its base. We have

\[\delta=D_{m}\text{ }i=e\text{ which implies }r_{i}=r_{2}.\]

Equation (9.34) gives

\[2r=A\text{ or }r=\frac{A}{2} \tag{9.36}\]

In the same way, Eq. (9.35) gives

\[D_{m}=2i-A\text{, or }i=(A+D_{m})/2 \tag{9.37}\]

The refractive index of the prism is

\[n_{21}=\frac{n_{22}}{n_{1}}=\frac{\sin\left[(A+D_{m})/2\right]}{\sin\left[A/2 \right]} \tag{9.38}\]

The angles \(A\) and \(D_{m}\) can be measured experimentally. Equation (9.38) thus provides a method of determining refractive index of the material of the prism.

For a small angle prism; i.e., a thin prism, \(D_{m}\) is also very small, and we get

\[n_{21}=\frac{\sin\left[(A+D_{m})/2\right]}{\sin\left[A/2\right]}\simeq\frac{ (A+D_{m})/2}{A/2}\]

\[D_{m}=(n_{21}-1)A\]

It implies that, thin prisms do not deviate light much.

### 9.7 Optical Instruments

A number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising reflecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms. Periscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some examples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use. Our eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature has endowed us with. We have already studied about the human eye in Class X. We now go on to describe the principles of working of the microscope and the telescope.

#### 9.7.1 The microscope

A simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length (Fig. 9.23). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held near the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned close to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magnified and virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed comfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance _f._ the image is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less

Figure 9.22: Plot of angle of deviation (\(\delta\)) versus angle of incidence (\(i\)) for a triangular prism.

than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than infinity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image is when it is at the near point (distance \(D\!\equiv\!25\) cm), it causes some strain on the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered most suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the first in Fig. 9.23(a), and the second in Fig. 9.23(b) and (c).

The linear magnification \(m\), for the image formed at the near point \(D\), by a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation

Figure 9.23: A simple microscope; (a) the magnifying lens is located such that the image is at the near point, (b) the angle subtanded by the object, is the same as that at the near point, and (c) the object near the focal point of the lens; the image is far off but closer than infinity.

\[m=\frac{v}{u}=v\left(\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{f}\right)=\left(1-\frac{v}{f}\right)\]

Now according to our sign convention, \(v\) is negative, and is equal in magnitude to \(D\). Thus, the magnification is

\[m=\left(1+\frac{D}{f}\right) \tag{9.39}\]

Since \(D\) is about 25 cm, to have a magnification of six, one needs a convex lens of focal length,\(f=5\) cm.

Note that \(m=h^{\prime}/h\) where \(h\) is the size of the object and \(h^{\prime}\) the size of the image. This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image to that subtended by the object, if placed at \(D\) for comfortable viewing. (Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the eye, which is \(h/u\).) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it allows the object to be brought closer to the eye than \(D\).

We will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In this case we will have to obtained the _angular_ magnification. Suppose the object has a height \(h\). The maximum angle it can subtend, and be clearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance \(D\). The angle subtended is then given by

\[\tan\ \theta_{o}=\left(\frac{h}{D}\right)\approx\theta_{o} \tag{9.40}\]

We now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the object is at \(u\). From the relations

\[\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=m=\frac{v}{u}\]

we have the angle subtended by the image

\[\tan\ \theta_{i}=\frac{h^{\prime}}{v}-\frac{h^{\prime}}{v}\cdot\frac{v}{u}= \frac{h}{u}\approx\theta\text{. The angle subtended by the object, when it is at }u=J\text{.} \tag{9.41}\]

as is clear from Fig. 9.23(c). The angular magnification is, therefore

\[m=\left(\frac{\theta_{i}}{\theta_{o}}\right)=\frac{D}{f} \tag{9.42}\]

This is one less than the magnification when the image is at the near point, Eq. (9.39), but the viewing is more comfortable and the difference in magnification is usually small. In subsequent discussions of optical instruments (microscope and telescope) we shall assume the image to be at infinity.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:717]

As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification \(m_{\rm e}\) due to it [Eq. (9.39)], when the final image is formed at the near point, is

\[m_{\rm e}=\left(1+\frac{D}{f_{e}}\right) \tag{9.44a}\]

When the final image is formed at infinity, the angular magnification due to the eyepiece [Eq. (9.42)] is

\(m_{\rm e}=\left(D/f_{e}\right)\)

Thus, the total magnification [according to Eq. (9.33)], when the image is formed at infinity, is

\[m= m_{\rm o}m_{\rm e}=\left(\frac{L}{f_{\rm o}}\right)\left(\frac{D}{f_{e}}\right) \tag{9.45}\]

Clearly, to achieve a large magnification of a _small_ object (hence the name microscope), the objective and eyepiece should have small focal lengths. In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller than 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large.

For example, with an objective with \(f_{\rm o}=1.0\) cm, and an eyepiece with focal length \(f_{\rm e}=2.0\) cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is

\[m= m_{\rm o}m_{\rm e}=\left(\frac{L}{f_{\rm o}}\right)\left(\frac{D}{f_{e}}\right) \tag{9.46}\]

Various other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to the quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi-component lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to improve image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects) in lenses.

#### 9.7.2 Telescope

The telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects (Fig. 9.25). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece. Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed in the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image producing a final inverted image. The magnifying power \(m\)is the ratio of the angle \(\beta\) subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle \(\alpha\) which the object subtends at the lens or the eye. Hence

\[m=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}=\frac{h}{f_{e}}.\frac{f_{\rm o}}{h}=\frac{f_{\rm o}}{f_ {e}} \tag{9.47}\]In this case, the length of the telescope tube is \(f_{o}*f_{e}\).

Terrestrial telescopes have, in addition, a pair of inverting lenses to make the final image erect. Refracting telescopes can be used both for terrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider a telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece a focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is m = 100/1 = 100.

Let us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1' (one minute of arc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 \(\times\) 1' = 100' =1.67\({}^{o}\).

The main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light gathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly depends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects can be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects distinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on the diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is to make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective in use has a diameter of 40.mch (\(\sim\)1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, USA Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore, difficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult and expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that are free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.

For these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather than a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called _reflecting_ telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror. Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs much less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported over its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem with a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside

Figure 25: A refracting telescope.

the telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right there, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage). This is what is done in the very large 200 inch(-5,08 m) diameters, Mt. Palomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the mirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the light being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a convex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes through a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.26. This is known as a _Cassegrain_ telescope, after its inventor. It has the advantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope in India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting telescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The largest reflecting telescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA, with a reflector of 10 metre in diameter.

## 10 Summary

1. Reflection is governed by the equation \(\angle i=\angle r^{\prime}\) and refraction by the Snell's law, sin\(i/\)sin\(r\)= \(n\), where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted ray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection and refraction are \(t\), \(r^{\prime}\) and \(r\), respectively.
2. The _critical angle of incidence_\(t\) for a ray incident from a denser to rarer medium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90\({}^{\circ}\). For \(t>t_{c}\), total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in diamond (\(t_{c}=24.4^{\circ}\)), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some examples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass fibres coated with a thin layer of material of _lower_ refractive index. Light incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after multiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.

Figure 9.26: Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).

3. _Cartesian sign convention_: Distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite direction are negative. All distances are measured from the pole/optic centre of the mirror/lens on the principal axis. The heights measured upwards above \(x\)-axis and normal to the principal axis of the mirror/lens are taken as positive. The heights measured downwards are taken as negative.
4. _Mirror equation_: \[\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}\] where \(u\) and \(v\) are object and image distances, respectively and \(f\)is the focal length of the mirror. \(f\) is (approximately) half the radius of curvature \(R\). \(f\)is negative for concave mirror; \(f\) is positive for a convex mirror.
5. For a prism of the angle \(A\), of refractive index \(n_{2}\) placed in a medium of refractive index \(n_{1}\). \[n_{21}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}=\frac{\sin\left[\left(A+D_{m}\right)/2\right]}{\sin \left(A/2\right)}\] where \(D_{m}\)is the angle of minimum deviation.

is given by \(m=1+(D/f)\), where \(D=25\) cm is the least distance of distinct vision and \(f\) is the focal length of the convex lens. If the image is at infinity, \(m=D/f\). For a compound microscope, the magnifying power is given by \(m=m_{\mathrm{e}}\times m_{\mathrm{o}}\) where \(m_{\mathrm{e}}=1+(D/f)\), is the magnification due to the eyepiece and \(m_{\mathrm{o}}\) is the magnification produced by the objective. _Approximately_.

\(m=\frac{L}{f_{\mathrm{o}}}\times\frac{D}{f_{\mathrm{e}}}\)

where \(f_{\mathrm{o}}\) and \(f_{\mathrm{e}}\) are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece, respectively, and \(L\) is the distance between their focal points.

### 9.4 Magnifying power \(m\) of a telescope

is the ratio of the angle \(\beta\) subtended at the eye by the image to the angle \(a\) subtended at the eye by the object.

\(m=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}=\frac{f_{\mathrm{o}}}{f_{\mathrm{e}}}\)

where \(f_{\mathrm{0}}\) and \(f_{\mathrm{e}}\) are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece, respectively.

## 10 Points to Ponder

1. The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and pairs of media at the point of the incidence.
2. The real image of an object placed between \(f\) and \(2f\) from a convex lens can be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is removed is the image still there? This question puzzles many, because it is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air without a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point on the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging away. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our eye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in air during a laser show.
3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all rays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is why you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say the page of a book.
4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in colour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours of the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an entirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in white light.
5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the angular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can keep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence have it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see. Without the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at 25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.

How far from the objective should an object be placed in order to obtain the final image at (a) the least distance of distinct vision (25 cm), and (b) at infinity? What is the magnifying power of the microscope in each case?

**9.15**: Use the mirror equation to deduce that: 1. an object placed between \(f\) and \(2f\) of a concave mirror produces a real image beyond \(2f\).
2. a convex mirror always produces a virtual image independent of the location of the object.

**Notes**

## Chapter 1 Introduction

In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell's law. It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface. The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction) bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the second medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled _OPTICKS_ and because of the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very often attributed to Newton.

In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the wave theory of light - it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in this chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain the phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on refraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the prediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much later confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of light in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the wave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.

The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of Newton's authority and also because light could travel through vacuumand it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate from one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed his famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established that light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible light was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 \(\upmu\)m. Because of the smallness of the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of typical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately travel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we had discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in which one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called geometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy propagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.

After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40 years or so, many experiments were carried out involving the interference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only be satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed to be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it was thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how could light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained when Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light. Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of electricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what is known as the wave equation from which he _predicted_ the existence of electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could calculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found that the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed of light. From this, he propounded that _light must be an electromagnetic wave_. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are associated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric field produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing magnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The changing electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of electromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum.

Footnote *: Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it was much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the laboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the _Hertzian_ waves

In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the _Huygens principle_ and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In Sections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference which is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we will discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-Fresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the phenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light waves are _transverse electromagnetic waves_.

### 10.2 Huygens Principle

We would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a _wavefront_; thus _a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant phase_. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.

If we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions, then the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in the same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a _spherical wave_ as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a small portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have what is known as a _plane wave_ [Fig. 10.1(b)].

Now, if we know the shape of the wavefront at \(t=0\), then Huygens principle allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time \(\tau\). Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction, which given the shape of the wavefront at any time allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging wave and let \(F_{1}F_{2}\) represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at \(t=0\) (Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, _each point of the wavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets emanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed of the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually referred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a later time._

Figure 10.2: \(F_{1}F_{2}\) represents the spherical wavefront (with \(O\) as centre) at \(t=0\). The envelope of the secondary wavelets emanating from \(F_{1}F_{2}\) produces the forward moving wavefront \(G_{1}G_{2}\). The backwave \(D_{1}D_{2}\) does not exist.

Figure 10.1: (a) A diverging spherical wave emanating from a point source. The wavefronts are spherical.

Thus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at \(t=\tau\), we draw spheres of radius \(v\tau\) from each point on the spherical wavefront where \(v\) represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at \(t=\tau\). The new wavefront shown as G\({}_{1}\)G\({}_{2}\) in Fig. 10.2 is again spherical with point O as the centre.

The above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which is shown as D\({}_{1}\)D\({}_{2}\) in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the secondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the backward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could explain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is not satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from more rigorous wave theory.

In a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the shape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium (Fig. 10.3).

### 10.3 Refraction and Reflection of Plane Waves using Huygens Principle

#### 10.3.1 Refraction of a plane wave

We will now use Huygens principle to derive the laws of refraction. Let PP represent the surface separating medium 1 and medium 2, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Let \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) represent the speed of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively. We assume a plane wavefront AB propagating in the direction A'A incident on the interface at an angle \(t\) as shown in the figure. Let \(\tau\) be the time taken by the wavefront to travel the distance BC. Thus,

Figure 10.4: _A plane wave AB is incident at an angle \(i\) on the surface PP separating medium 1 and medium 2. The plane wave undergoes refraction and CE represents the refracted wavefront. The figure corresponds to \(v_{2}<v_{1}\) so that the refracted waves bends towards the normal._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:733]

The above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a denser medium (\(v_{i}>v_{2}\)) the wavelength and the speed of propagation decrease but the _frequency_\(v(=v/\lambda)\)_remains the same._

#### 10.3.2 Refraction at a rarer medium

We now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e., \(v_{2}>v_{1}\). Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a refracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5. The angle of refraction will now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have \(n_{1}\sin i=n_{2}\sin r\). We define an angle \(i_{c}\) by the following equation

\[\sin i_{c}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \tag{10.8}\]

Thus, if \(i=i_{c}\) then \(\sin r=1\) and \(r=90^{\circ}\). Obviously, for \(i>i_{c}\), there can not be any refracted wave. The angle \(i_{c}\) is known as the _critical angle_ and for all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have any refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as _total internal reflection_. The phenomenon of total internal reflection and its applications was discussed in Section 9.4.

#### 10.3.3 Reflection of a plane wave by a plane surface

We next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle \(i\) on a reflecting surface MN. If \(v\) represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if \(\tau\) represents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B to \(C\) then the distance

\[\mathrm{BC}=v\tau\]

In order to construct the reflected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius \(v\tau\) from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6. Let CE represent the tangent plane drawn from the point C to this sphere. Obviously

\[\mathrm{AE}=\mathrm{BC}=v\tau\]

Figure 10.5: Refraction of a plane wave incident on a rarer medium for which \(v_{2}>v_{i}\). The plane wave bends away from the normal.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:735]

**Example 10.1**:
1. When monochromatic light is incident on a surface separating two media, the reflected and refracted light both have the same frequency as the incident frequency. Explain why?
2. When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed decreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the energy carried by the light wave?
3. In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the square of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity of light in the photon picture of light.

**Solution**

1. Reflection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light with the atomic constituents of matter. Atoms may be viewed as oscillators, which take up the frequency of the external agency (light) causing forced oscillations. The frequency of light emitted by a charged oscillator equals its frequency of oscillation. Thus, the frequency of scattered light equals the frequency of incident light.
2. No. Energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave, not on the speed of wave propagation.
3. For a given frequency, intensity of light in the photon picture is determined by the number of photons crossing an unit area per unit time.

**FIGURE 10.8** (a) Two needles oscillating in phase in water represent two coherent sources. (b) The pattern, of displacement of water molecules at an instant on the surface of water showing nodal N (no displacement) and antinodal A (maximum displacement) lines.

Consider two needles S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) moving periodically up and down in an identical fashion in a trough of water [Fig. 10.8(a)]. They produce two water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between the displacements produced by each of the waves does not change with time; when this happens the two sources are said to be _coherent_. Figure 10.8(b) shows the position of crests (solid circles) and troughs (dashed circles) at a given instant of time. Consider a point P for which

**FIGURE 10.9** (a) Two needles oscillating in phase in water represent two coherent sources. (b) The pattern, of displacement of water molecules at an instant on the surface of water showing nodal N (no displacement) and antinodal A (maximum displacement) lines.

Since the distances \(S_{1}P\) and \(S_{2}P\) are equal, waves from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) will take the same time to travel to the point \(P\) and waves that emanate from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) in phase will also arrive, at the point \(P\), in phase.

Thus, if the displacement produced by the source \(S_{1}\) at the point \(P\) is given by

\(y_{1}=a\cos\mathit{ot}\)

then, the displacement produced by the source \(S_{2}\) (at the point \(P\)) will also be given by

\(y_{2}=a\cos\mathit{ot}\)

Thus, the resultant of displacement at \(P\) would be given by

\(y=y_{1}+y_{2}=2\ a\cos\mathit{ot}\)

Since the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, the resultant intensity will be given by

\(I=4\ I_{0}\)

where \(I_{0}\) represents the intensity produced by each one of the individual sources; \(I_{0}\) is proportional to \(\alpha^{2}\). In fact at any point on the perpendicular, bisector of \(S_{1}S_{2}\), the intensity will be \(4I_{0}\). The two sources are said to interfere constructively and we have what is referred to as _constructive interference_. We next consider a point \(Q\) [Fig. 10.9(a)]

for which

\(S_{2}Q-S_{1}Q=2\lambda\)

The waves emanating from \(S_{1}\) will arrive exactly two cycles earlier than the waves from \(S_{2}\) and will again be in phase [Fig. 10.9(a)]. Thus, if the displacement produced by \(S_{1}\) is given by

\(y_{1}=a\cos\mathit{ot}\)

then the displacement produced by \(S_{2}\) will be given by

\(y_{2}=a\cos\mathit{(ot-4\pi)}=a\cos\mathit{ot}\)

where we have used the fact that a path difference of \(2\lambda\) corresponds to a phase difference of \(4\pi\). The two displacements are once again in phase and the intensity will again be \(4I_{0}\) giving rise to constructive interference. In the above analysis we have assumed that the distances \(S_{1}Q\) and \(S_{2}Q\) are much greater than \(\alpha\)(which represents the distance between \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\)) so that although \(S_{1}Q\) and \(S_{2}Q\) are not equal, the amplitudes of the displacement produced by each wave are very nearly the same.

We next consider a point \(R\) [Fig. 10.9(b)] for which

\(S_{2}R-S_{1}R=-2.5\lambda\)

The waves emanating from \(S_{1}\) will arrive exactly two and a half cycles later than the waves from \(S_{2}\) [Fig. 10.10(b)]. Thus if the displacement produced by \(S_{1}\) is given by

When the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes rapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when this happens the intensities just add up. This is indeed what happens when two separate light sources illuminate a wall.

### Interference of Light Waves and Young's Experiment

We will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any interference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase changes in times of the order of \(10^{-10}\) seconds. Thus the light waves coming out from two independent sources of light will not have any fixed phase relationship and would be incoherent, when this happens, as discussed in the previous section, the intensities on the screen will add up.

The British physicist Thomas Young used an ingenious technique to "lock" the phases of the waves emanating from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\). He made two pinholes S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) (very close to each other) on an opaque screen (Fig. 10.12(a)). These were illuminated by another pinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source. Light waves spread out from S and fall on both S, and S\({}_{2}\). S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) then behave like two coherent sources because light waves coming out from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are derived from the same original source and any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in exactly similar phase changes in the light coming out from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\). Thus, the two sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) will be _locked_ in phase; i.e., they will be coherent like the two vibrating needle in our water wave example (Fig. 10.8(a)).

The spherical waves emanating from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) will produce interference fringes on the screen GG', as shown in Fig. 10.12(b). The positions of maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated by using the analysis given in Section 10.4.

Figure 10.12: Young’s arrangement to produce interference pattern.

Figure 10.11: If two sodium lamps illuminate two pinholes S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) the intensities will add up and no interference fringes will be observed on the screen.

We will have constructive interference resulting in a bright region when \(\frac{xd}{D}=n\lambda\). That is,

\[x=x_{n}=\frac{n\lambda D}{d};\,n=0,\,\pm\,1,\,\pm\,2,\,... \tag{10.13}\]

On the other hand, we will have destructive interference resulting in a dark region when \(\frac{xd}{D}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\,\lambda\) that is

\[x=x_{n}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\,\frac{\cdot\,\,\lambda D}{d};\,\,\,n=0,\,\pm\,1,\pm\,2 \tag{10.14}\]

Thus dark and bright bands appear on the screen, as shown in Fig. 10.13. Such bands are called _fringes_. Equations (10.13) and (10.14) show that dark and bright fringes are equally spaced.

### Diffraction

If we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the region of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions just like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of waves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves. Since the wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of most obstacles; we do not encounter diffraction effects of light in everyday

observations. However, the finite resolution of our eye or of optical instruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is viewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon of diffraction.

#### 10.6.1 The single slit

In the discussion of Young's experiment, we stated that a single narrow slit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young, early experimenters - including Newton - had noticed that light spreads out from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and enter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as _diffraction_, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all, you are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking around a corner!

When the double slit in Young's experiment is replaced by a single narrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern with a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate dark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the centre (Fig. 10.15). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.14, which shows a parallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width \(\alpha\). The diffracted light goes on to meet a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M.

A straight line through M.perpendicular to the slit plane meets the screen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight lines joining P to the different points L.M.N, etc., can be treated as parallel, making an angle \(\theta\) with the normal MC.

The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add their contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating different parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources are in phase.

It is observed that the intensity has a central maximum at \(\theta\) = 0 and other secondary maxima at \(\theta\) = (\(n\)+1/2) \(\lambda/a\), which go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing \(n\). The minima (zero intensity) are at \(\theta\) = \(n\lambda/a\), \(n\) = \(\pm\)1, \(\pm\)2, \(\pm\)3,....

The photograph and intensity pattern corresponding to it is shown in Fig. 10.15.

There has been prolonged discussion about difference between intereference and diffraction among

Figure 10.15: Intensity distribution and photograph of fringes due to diffraction at single slit.

scientists since the discovery of these phenomena. In this context, it is interesting to note what Richard Feynman* has said in his famous Feynman Lectures on Physics:

Footnote *: Richard Feynman was one of the recipients of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics.

_No one has ever been able to define the difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question of usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference between them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to say that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering sources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used._

In the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the screen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit or hole, and the double-slit interference pattern.

#### 10.6.2 Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern

It is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself. The equipment needed can be found in most homes -- two razor blades and one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One has to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a narrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers (Fig. 10.16).

Keep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use spectacles if you normally do: With slight adjustment of the width of the slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its bright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the central one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using a filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen.

In this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in Fig. 10.15. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the retina of the eye).

With some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with a blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young's experiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending a small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny convex surface (e.g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight - it can damage the eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle of (1/2).

_In interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy, which is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy._

### 10.7 Polarisation

Consider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of which is assumed to be fixed. If we move the end of the string up and down in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating in the +\(x\) direction (Fig. 10.17). Such a wave could be described by the following equation

\[y\left(x,t\right)=a\sin\left(kx\right)\left(\omega t\right) \tag{10.15}\]

where \(a\) and \(\omega\)(\(=2\pi\left\langle y\right\rangle\) represent the amplitude and the angular frequency of the wave, respectively; further,

\[\dot{\lambda}=\frac{2\pi}{\kappa} \tag{10.16}\]

represents the wavelength associated with the wave. We had discussed propagation of such waves in Chapter 14 of Class XI textbook. Since the displacement (which is along the \(y\) direction) is at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a _transverse wave_. Also, since the displacement is in the \(y\) direction, it is often referred to as a \(y\)-polarised wave. Since each point on the string moves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised

Figure 10.17: (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at \(t=0\) and at \(t=\Delta t\), respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating in the +\(x\)-direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation of the displacement at \(x=0\) when a sinusoidal wave is propagating in the +\(x\)-direction. At \(x=\Delta x\), the time variation of the displacement will be slightly displaced to the right.

wave. Further, the string always remains confined to the \(x\)-\(y\) plane and therefore it is also referred to as a _plane polarised wave_.

In a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the \(x\)-\(z\) plane generating a z-polarised wave whose displacement will be given by

\[z\left(x,t\right)=a\sin\left(kx-ot\right) \tag{10.17}\]

It should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described by Eqs. (10.15) and (10.17)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the displacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of the string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we have what is known as an _unpolarised wave_. Thus, for an unpolarised wave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it will always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Light waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated with a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple polaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called _polaroids_. A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating light wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed. Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then the light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction is known as the _pass-axis_ of the polaroid.

Thus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes through a polaroid sheet \(P_{1}\), it is observed that its intensity is reduced by half. Rotating \(P_{1}\) has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted intensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid \(P_{2}\) be placed before \(P_{1}\). As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in intensity on passing through \(P_{2}\) alone. But now rotating \(P_{1}\) has a dramatic effect on the light coming from \(P_{2}\). In one position, the intensity transmitted by \(P_{2}\) followed by \(P_{1}\) is nearly zero. When turned by \(90^{\circ}\) from this position, \(P_{1}\) transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from \(P_{2}\) (Fig. 10.18).

The experiment at figure 10.18 can be easily understood by assuming that light passing through the polaroid \(P_{2}\) gets polarised along the pass-axis of \(P_{2}\). If the pass-axis of \(P_{2}\) makes an angle \(\theta\) with the pass-axis of \(P_{1}\), then when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid \(P_{2}\), the component \(E\)\(\cos\)\(\theta\) (along the pass-axis of \(P_{2}\)) will pass through \(P_{2}\). Thus, as we rotate the polaroid \(P_{1}\)(or \(P_{2}\)), the intensity will vary as:

\[I=I_{0}\cos^{2}\theta \tag{10.18}\]

where \(I_{0}\) is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through \(P_{1}\). This is known as _Malus' law_. The above discussion shows that the intensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity. By putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled from 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between the pass-axes of two polaroids.

Polaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses, windowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and 3D movie cameras.

**Example 10.2**: Discuss the intensity of transmitted light when a polaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids?

**Solution** Let \(I_{0}\) be the intensity of polarised light after passing through the first polariser \(P_{1}\). Then the intensity of light after passing through second polariser \(P_{2}\) will be

\(I=I_{0}\cos^{2}\theta\).

where \(\theta\) is the angle between pass axes of \(P_{1}\) and \(P_{2}\). Since \(P_{1}\) and \(P_{3}\) are crossed the angle between the pass axes of \(P_{2}\) and \(P_{3}\) will be \((\pi/2-\theta)\). Hence the intensity of light emerging from \(P_{3}\) will be

\(I=I_{0}\cos^{2}\theta\ \cos^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)\)

\(=I_{0}\cos^{2}\theta\ \sin^{2}\theta=\)(\(I_{0}/4\)) \(\sin^{2}2\theta\)

Therefore, the transmitted intensity will be maximum when \(\theta=\pi/4\).

**Figure 10.18** (a) Passage of light through two polaroids \(P_{2}\) and \(P_{1}\). The transmitted fraction falls from 1 to 0 as the angle between them varies from 0° to 90°. Notice that the light seen through a single polaroid \(P_{1}\) does not vary with angle. (b) Behaviour of the electric vector when light passes through two polaroids. The transmitted polarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis. The double arrows show the oscillations of the electric vector.

## Summary

1. Huygens' principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source of secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time.
2. Huygens' construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward envelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is independent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays are then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel is the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well known laws of reflection and refraction.
3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more sources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider, the intensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an interference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities. But this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which occurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable phase difference.
4. Young's double slit of separation d gives equally spaced interference fringes.
5. A single slit of width \(a\) gives a diffraction pattern with a central maximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of \(\pm\frac{A}{a},\pm\frac{2A}{a}\), etc., with successively weaker secondary maxima in between.
6. Natural light, e.g., from the sum is unpolarized. This means the electric vector takes all possible directions. In the transverse plane, rapidly and randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one component (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called linearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed through a second polariod whose axis turns through \(2\pi\), two maxima and minima of intensity are seen.

## Points to Ponder

1. Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was seen to travel along narrow rays. It required the insight and experiment of Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could explain all aspects of the behaviour of light.
2. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different sources which can be both constructve and destructive, as shown in Young's experiment.
3. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the ability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is set by the wavelength of light.
4. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves like sound in air. But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse waves like light waves.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

The Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly established the wave nature of light. Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity (electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas in the discharge tube. A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it being yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode. These _cathode raus_ were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge tube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speedand the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (\(e/m\))] of the cathode ray particles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 x10\({}^{8}\) m/s). The presently accepted value of \(e/m\) is 1.76 x 10\({}^{11}\) C/kg. Further, the value of \(e/m\) was found to be independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode (emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.

Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having small speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were found to emit negatively charged particles. The value of \(e/m\) of these particles was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These observations thus established that all these particles, although produced under different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1897, named these particles as _electrons_, and suggested that they were fundamental, universal constituents of matter. For his epoch-making discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R. A. Millikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for the precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that the charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary charge, 1.602 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C. Millikan's experiment established that _electric charge is quantised_. From the values of charge (\(e\)) and specific charge (\(e/m\)), the mass (\(m\)) of the electron could be determined.

### Electron Emission

We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that are responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot normally escape out of the metal surface, If an electron attempts to come out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge and pulls the electron back to the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal surface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome the attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be given to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface is called the _work function_ of the metal. It is generally denoted by \(\phi_{0}\) and measured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it has been accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt, so that 1 eV = 1.602x10\({}^{-19}\) J.

This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics. The work function (\(\phi_{0}\)) depends on the properties of the metal and the nature of its surface.

The minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal surface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following physical processes:

**(i)**: _Thermionic emission_: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the metal.

* _Field emission_: By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of \(10^{8}\) V m\({}^{-1}\)) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a spark plug.
* _Photoelectric emission_: When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These photo(light)-generated electrons are called _photoelectrons_.

### 11.3 Photoelectric Effect

#### Hertz's observations

The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.

Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space.

#### Hallwachs and Lenard's observations

Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.

Lenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also stopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus, light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external circuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.

Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was irradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a positively charged zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light.

After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Dueto negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector plate by the electric field. Hallwachs and Lenard also observed that when ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain minimum value, called the _threshold frequency_. This minimum frequency depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.

It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc., responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause electron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive even to visible light. All these _photosensitive substances_ emit electrons when they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these electrons were termed as _photoelectrons_. The phenomenon is called _photoelectric effect_.

### 11.4 Experimental Study of Photoelectric Effect

Figure 11.1 depicts a schematic view of the arrangement used for the experimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated glass/quartz tube having a thin photosensitive plate C and another metal plate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive plate C (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate the photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and are collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the battery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates C and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be reversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C.

When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are attracted to it. The emission of electrons causes flow of electric current in the circuit. The potential difference between the emitter and collector plates is measured by a voltmeter (V) whereas the resulting photo current flowing in the circuit is measured by a microammeter (\(\mu\)A). The photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter plate C. The intensity and frequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the potential difference V between the emitter C and the collector A.

We can use the experimental arrangement of Fig. 11.1 to study the variation of photocurrent with (a) intensity of radiation, (b) frequency of incident radiation, (c) the potential difference between the plates A and C, and (d) the nature of the material of plate C. Light of different frequencies can be used by putting appropriate coloured filter or coloured glass in the path of light falling on the emitter C. The intensity of light is varied by changing the distance of the light source from the emitter.

#### Effect of intensity of light on photocurrent

The collector A is maintained at a positive potential with respect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are attracted towards collector A. Keeping the frequency of the incident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of light is varied and the resulting photoelectric current is measured each time. It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly with intensity of incident light as shown graphically in Fig. 2. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per second. This implies that _the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation._

#### Effect of potential on photoelectric current

We first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the plate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency \(\nu\) and fixed intensity \(I_{1}\). We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and measure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating) potential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the emitted electrons are collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current becomes maximum or saturates, If we increase the accelerating potential of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum value of the photoelectric current is called _saturation current_. Saturation current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A.

We now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect to the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually. When the polarity is reversed, the electrons are repelled and only the sufficiently energetic electrons are able to reach the collector A. The photocurrent is found to decrease rapidly until it drops to zero at a certain sharply defined, critical value of the negative potential \(V_{0}\) on the plate A. For a particular frequency of incident radiation, _the minimum negative (retarding) potential \(V_{0}\) given to the plate A for which the photocurrent stops or becomes zero is called the cutoff or stopping potential._

The interpretation of the observation in terms of photoelectrons is straightforward. All the photoelectrons emitted from the metal do not have the

same energy. Photoelectric current is zero when the stopping potential is sufficient to repel even the most energetic photoelectrons, with the maximum kinetic energy (\(K_{\text{max}}\)), so that

\[K_{\text{max}}=e\,V_{0} \tag{11.1}\]

We can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same frequency but of higher intensity \(I_{2}\) and \(I_{3}\) (\(I_{3}>I_{2}>I_{1}\)). We note that the saturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the intensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the same as that for the incident radiation of intensity \(I_{1}\), as shown graphically in Fig. 11.3. Thus, _for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity._ In other words, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident radiation.

#### Effect of frequency of incident radiation on stopping potential

We now study the relation between the frequency \(\nu\) of the incident radiation and the stopping potential \(V_{0}\). We suitably adjust the same intensity of light radiation at various frequencies and study the variation of photocurrent with collector plate potential. The resulting variation is shown in Fig. 11.4. We obtain different values of stopping potential but the same value of the saturation current for incident radiation of different frequencies. The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiations. The stopping potential is more negative for higher frequencies of incident radiation. Note from Fig. 11.4 that the stopping potentials are in the order \(V_{0}\geqslant V_{0}\geqslant V_{0}\) if the frequencies are in the order \(V_{3}>V_{2}>V_{1}\). This implies that greater the frequency of incident light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. Consequently, we need greater retarding potential to stop them completely. If we plot a graph between the frequency of incident radiation and the corresponding stopping potential for different metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 11.5. The graph shows that

1. the stopping potential \(V_{0}\) varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation for a given photosensitive material.
2. there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency \(v_{0}\) for which the stopping potential is zero.

These observations have two implications:

1. _The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity._
2. _For a frequency \(\nu\) of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off frequency \(\nu_{o}\), no photoelectric emission is possible even if the intensity is large._ This minimum, cut-off frequency \(\nu_{o}\), is called the _threshold frequency_. It is different for different metals.

Different photosensitive materials respond differently to light. Selenium is more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance gives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example, ultraviolet light gives rise to photoelectric effect in copper while green or red light does not.

Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if the incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in a time of the order of \(10^{-9}\)s or less.

We now summarise the experimental features and observations described in this section.

1. For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation (above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 11.2).
2. For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation, saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of its intensity (Fig. 11.3).
3. For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the _threshold frequency_, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place, no matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity (Fig. 11.5).
4. The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any apparent time lag (\(\sim\)\(10^{-9}\)s or less), even when the incident radiation is made exceedingly dim.

### Photoelectric Effect and Wave Theory of Light

The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth century. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light. According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over the region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric emission given in the previous section.

According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape from the metal surface. A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i), (ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.

Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous. In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of photoelectric emission.

### Einstein's Photoelectric Equation: Energy Quantum of Radiation

In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture, photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of energy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units - the so called _quanta of energy of radiation_. Each quantum of radiant energy has energy \(h\nu\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(\nu\) the frequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (\(h\nu\)) of radiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum energy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work function \(\phi_{0}\)), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy

\[K_{\rm max}=h\nu-\phi_{0} \tag{11.2}\]

More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less than the maximum value. Note that the intensity of light of a given frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second. Increasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon.

Equation (11.2) is known as _Einstein's photoelectric equation_. We now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:756]

independent of the nature of the material. During 1906-1916, Millikan performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein's photoelectric equation. He measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the known value of \(e\), he determined the value of Planck's constant \(h\). This value was close to the value of Planck's contant (= 6.626 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-34}\)J s) determined in an entirely different context. In this way, in 1916, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein's photoelectric equation, instead of disproving it.

The successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis of light quanta and the experimental determination of values of \(h\) and \(\phi_{0}\), in agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the acceptance of Einstein's picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals over a wide range of radiation frequencies.

### Particle Nature of Light: The Photon

Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of energy, each of energy \(h\)\(v\).

Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be associated with momentum (\(h\)\(v\)/\(c\)). A definite value of energy as well as momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated with a particle. This particle was later named _photon_. The particle-like behaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of A.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.

We can summarise the photon picture of electromagnetic radiation as follows:

1. In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is made up of particles called photons.
2. Each photon has energy \(\overline{E}\) (=\(h\)\(v\)) and momentum \(p\) (= \(h\)\(v\)/\(c\)), and speed \(c\), the speed of light.
3. All photons of light of a particular frequency \(v\), or wavelength \(\lambda\), have the same energy \(E\) (=\(h\)\(v\) = \(hc\)/\(\lambda\)) and momentum \(p\) (= \(h\)\(v\)/\(c\)= \(h\)/\(\lambda\)), whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation.
4. Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields.
5. In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be created.

**Example 11.1**: Monochromatic light of frequency 6.0 \(\times 10^{14}\) Hz is produced by a laser. The power emitted is 2.0 \(\times 10^{-3}\) W. (a) What is the energy of a photon in the light beam? (b) How many photons per second, on an average, are emitted by the source?

**Solution**

(a) Each photon has an energy

\(E=h\)\(v=\) ( 6.63 \(\times 10^{-34}\) J s) (6.0 \(\times 10^{14}\) Hz)

\(=3.98\times 10^{-19}\) J

(b) If \(N\) is the number of photons emitted by the source per second, the power \(P\) transmitted in the beam equals \(N\) times the energy per photon \(E\), so that \(P\) = _N E_. Then

\[N=\frac{P}{E}=\frac{2.0\times 10^{-3}\) W

\(=5.0\times 10^{15}\) photons per second.

**Example 11.2**: The work function of caesium is 2.14 eV. Find (a) the threshold frequency for caesium, and (b) the wavelength of the incident light if the photocurrent is brought to zero by a stopping potential of 0.60 V.

**Solution**

(a) For the cut-off or threshold frequency, the energy \(h\) v\({}_{0}\) of the incident radiation must be equal to work function \(\phi_{o}\), so that

\(v_{0}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{\hbar}=\frac{2.14\,\mathrm{eV}}{6.63\times 10^{-34}\, \mathrm{J}s}=5.16\times 10^{14}\) Hz

Thus, for frequencies less than this threshold frequency, no photoelectrons are ejected.

(b) Photocurrent reduces to zero, when maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons equals the potential energy _e V\({}_{0}\)_ by the retarding potential _V\({}_{0}\)_. Einstein's Photoelectric equation is

\(\frac{\mathrm{eV}_{0}}{\hbar}=h\)\(v-\phi_{0}=\frac{h}{\lambda}-\phi_{0}\)

or, \(\lambda=hc/(\mathrm{eV}_{0}+\phi_{0})\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{(6.63\times 10^{-34}\,\mathrm{J}s)\times(3\times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{m}/ \mathrm{s})}{(0.60\,\mathrm{eV}+2.14\,\mathrm{eV})}\)

\(\cdot\)

\(=\frac{19.89\times 10^{-26}\,\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{m}}{(2.74\,\mathrm{eV})}\)

\(\lambda=\frac{19.89\times 10^{-26}\,\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{m}}{2.74\times 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{J}}=454\) nm

### Wave Nature of Matter

The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the preceding chapters. The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, inphotoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of particles - the photons. Whether a particle or wave description is best suited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the experiment. For example, in the familiar phenomenon of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are important. The gathering and focussing mechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture. But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon picture of light.

A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-particle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie (pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under suitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the two basic physical entities - matter and energy, must have symmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter. De Broglie proposed that the wave length \(\lambda\) associated with a particle of momentum \(p\) is given as

\[\lambda\ =\ \frac{\cdot}{p}=\ \frac{h}{mv} \tag{1.1.5}\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the particle and \(v\) its speed. Equation (11.5) is known as the _de Broglie relation_ and the wavelength \(\lambda\) of the _matter wave_ is called _de Broglie wavelength_. The dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation. On the left hand side of Eq. (11.5), \(\lambda\) is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side the momentum \(p\) is a typical attribute of a particle. Planck's constant \(h\) relates the two attributes.

Equation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose validity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see that it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,

\[p=hv/c \tag{11.6}\]

Therefore,

\[\frac{\cdot}{p}=\frac{c}{\nu}=\lambda \tag{11.7}\]

That is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a quantum of energy and momentum.

Clearly, from Eq. (11.5), \(\lambda\) is smaller for a heavier particle (large \(m\)) or more energetic particle (large \(v\)). For example, the de Broglie wavelength of a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\) is easily calculated:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:760]

3. Photoelectric current depends on (I) the intensity of incident light, (ii) the potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii) the nature of the emitter material.
4. The stopping potential (\(V\)) depends on (I) the frequency of incident light, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency of incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted: \(e\ V_{\mathrm{o}}=(1/2)\ m\ v_{\mathrm{max}}^{\mathrm{\prime}}=K_{\mathrm{max}}\).
5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency) \(v_{\mathrm{o}}\), characteristic of the metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large the intensity may be.
6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of photoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy from radiation could not explain the independence of \(K_{\mathrm{max}}\) on intensity, the existence of \(v_{\mathrm{o}}\) and the instantaneous nature of the process. Einstein explained these features on the basis of photon picture of light. According to this, light is composed of discrete packets of energy called quanta or photons. Each photon carries an energy \(E\ (=h\ v)\) and momentum \(p\ (=h/\lambda)\), which depend on the frequency (\(v\)) of incident light and not on its intensity. Photoelectric emission from the metal surface occurs due to absorption of a photon by an electron.
7. Einstein's photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy conservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in the metal. The maximum kinetic energy \((1/2)m\ v_{\mathrm{max}}^{\mathrm{\prime}}\) is equal to the photon energy (\(h\ v\)) minus the work function \(\phi_{\mathrm{o}}(=h\ v)\) of the target metal: \[\frac{1}{2}\ m\ v_{\mathrm{max}}^{\mathrm{\prime}}=\sqrt[V_{\mathrm{o}}\ e]{\ \ \mathrm{n}v-\phi_{\mathrm{o}}=h\ (v-v_{\mathrm{o}})}\] This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric effect. Millikan's first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein's photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck's constant \(h\). This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description (nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.
8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment determines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for understanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and matter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie attributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves associated with the moving material particles are called matter waves or de Broglie waves.
9. The de Broglie wavelength (\(\lambda\)) associated with a moving particle is related to its momentum \(p\) as: \(\lambda=h/p\). The dualism of matter is inherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept (\(\lambda\)) and a particle concept (\(p\)). The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of the material particle. It is significantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case of macroscopic objects, commonly encountered in everyday life.

1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the metal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get out of the metal.
2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules in a gasjar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell's distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do with the fact that electrons obey Pauli's exclusion principle.
3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal.
4. Observations on photoelectric effect imply that in the event of matter-light interaction, _absorption of energy takes place in discrete units of hv._ This is not quite the same as saying that light consists of particles, each of energy _hv._
5. Observations on the stopping potential (its independence of intensity and dependence on frequency) are the crucial discriminator between the wave-picture and photon-picture of photoelectric effect.
6. The wavelength of a matter wave given by \(\lambda=\frac{\hbar}{p}\) has physical significance; its phase velocity \(v_{b}\) has no physical significance. However, the group velocity of the matter wave is physically meaningful and equals the velocity of the particle.

1.1. Find the (a) maximum frequency, and (b) minimum wavelength of X-rays produced by 30 kV electrons.

The work function of caesium metal is 2.14 eV. When light of frequency 6 \(\times 10^{14}\)Hz is incident on the metal surface, photoemission of electrons occurs. What is the (a) maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, (b) Stopping potential, and (c) maximum speed of the emitted photoelectrons?

The photoelectric cut-off voltage in a certain experiment is 1.5 V. What is the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons emitted?

Monochromatic light of wavelength 632.8 nm is produced by a helium-neon laser. The power emitted is 9.42 mW.

Find the energy and momentum of each photon in the light beam, (b) How many photons per second, on the average, arrive at a target irradiated by this beam? (Assume the beam to have uniform cross-section which is less than the target area), and (c) How fast does a hydrogen atom have to travel in order to have the same momentum as that of the photon?

In an experiment on photoelectric effect, the slope of the cut-off voltage versus frequency of incident light is found to be 4.12 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-15}\) V s. Calculate the value of Planck's constant.

The threshold frequency for a certain metal is 3.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz. If light of frequency 8.2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz is incident on the metal, predict the cut-off voltage for the photoelectric emission.

The work function for a certain metal is 4.2 eV. Will this metal give photoelectric emission for incident radiation of wavelength 330 nm?

Light of frequency 7.21 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz is incident on a metal surface. Electrons with a maximum speed of 6.0 \(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) m/s are ejected from the surface. What is the threshold frequency for photoemission of electrons?

Light of wavelength 488 nm is produced by an argon laser which is used in the photoelectric effect, When light from this spectral line is incident on the emitter, the stopping (cut-off) potential of photoelectrons is 0.38 V. Find the work function of the material from which the emitter is made.

What is the de Broglie wavelength of

a bullet of mass 0.040 kg travelling at the speed of 1.0 km/s, (b) a ball of mass 0.060 kg moving at a speed of 1.0 m/s, and (c) a dust particle of mass 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) kg drifting with a speed of 2.2 m/s?

Show that the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is equal to the de Broglie wavelength of its quantum (photon).

## Chapter Twelve ATOMS

### 12.1 Introduction

By the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favour of atomic hypothesis of matter. In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge through gases carried out by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856 - 1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged constituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a whole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some positive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what is the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom? In other words, what is the structure of an atom?

The first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898. According to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged electrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was picturesquely called _plum pudding model_ of the atom. However subsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that the distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different from that proposed in this model.

We know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at all temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous distribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different intensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atomsand molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or molecule with its neighbours. _In contrast_, light emitted from rarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a glow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour light has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum appears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the average spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the radiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms rather than because of interactions between atoms or molecules.

In the early nineteenth century it was also established that each element is associated with a characteristic spectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives a set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines. This fact suggested an intimate relationship between the internal structure of an atom and the spectrum of radiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer (1825 - 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which gave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic hydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements known, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this chapter.

Ernst Rutherford (1871-1937), a former research student of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on \(\alpha\)-particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906, he proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these \(\alpha\)-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure. This experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Ernst Marsden (1889-1970, who was 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his bachelor's degree). The details are discussed in Section 12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of Rutherford's planetary model of atom (also called the _nuclear model of the atom_). According to this the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving around the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun.

Rutherford's nuclear model was a major step towards how we see the atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of only discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen, consisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex spectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the electron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves round the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious difficulties in accepting such a model.

### Alpha-particle Scattering and Rutherford's Nuclear Model of Atom

At the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H. Geiger and E. Marsden performed some experiments. In one of their experiments, as shown in A typical graph of the total number of \(\alpha\)-particles scattered at different angles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3. The dots in this figure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical prediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Many of the \(\alpha\)-particles pass through the foil. It means that they do not suffer any collisions. Only about 0.14% of the incident \(\alpha\)-particles scatter by more than 1\({}^{\circ}\); and about 1 in 8000 deflect by more than 90\({}^{\circ}\). Rutherford argued that, to deflect the \(\alpha\)-particle backwards, it must experience a large repulsive force. This force could be provided if the greater part of the mass of the atom and its positive charge were concentrated tightly at its centre. Then the incoming \(\alpha\)-particle could get very close to the positive charge without penetrating it, and such a close encounter would result in a large deflection. This agreement supported the hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This is why Rutherford is credited with the _discovery_ of the nucleus.

In Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom are concentrated in the nucleus with the electrons some distance away. The electrons would be moving in orbits about the nucleus just as the planets do around the sun. Rutherford's experiments suggested the size of the nucleus to be about 10\({}^{-15}\) m to 10\({}^{-14}\) m. From kinetic theory, the size of an atom was known to be 10\({}^{-10}\) m about 10,000 to 100,000 times larger than the size of the nucleus. Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom being largely empty space, it is easy to see why most \(\alpha\)-particles go right through a thin metal foil. However, when \(\alpha\)-particle happens to come near a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle. The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the \(\alpha\)-particles.

The scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it can be assumed that \(\alpha\)-particles will suffer not more than one scattering during their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory of an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-particles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e, of positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of the gold nucleus is Ze, where \(Z\) is the atomic number of the atom; for gold \(Z\)= 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an \(\alpha\)-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary throughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the trajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton's second law of motion and the Coulomb's law for electrostatic force of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively charged nucleus.

The magnitude of this force is

\[F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{(2e)(Ze)}{r^{2}} \tag{12.1}\]

where \(r\) is the distance between the \(\alpha\)-particle and the nucleus. The force is directed along the line joining the \(\alpha\)-particle and the nucleus. The magnitude and direction of the force on an \(\alpha\)-particle continuously changes as it approaches the nucleus and recedes away from it.

#### 12.2.1 Alpha-particle trajectory

The trajectory traced by an \(\alpha\)-particle depends on the impact parameter, \(b\) of collision. The _impact parameter_ is the perpendicular distance of the initial velocity vector of the \(\alpha\)-particle from the centre of the nucleus (Fig. 12.4). A given beam of \(\alpha\)-particles has a distribution of impact parameters \(b\), so that the beam is scattered in various directions with different probabilities (Fig. 12.4). (In a beam, all particles have nearly same kinetic energy.) It is seen that an \(\alpha\)-particle close to the nucleus (small impact parameter) suffers large scattering. In case of head-on collision, the impact parameter is minimum and the \(\alpha\)-particle rebounds back(\(\theta\approx\pi\)). For a large impact parameter, the \(\alpha\)-particle goes nearly undeviated and has a small deflection (\(\theta\equiv 0\)).

The fact that only a small fraction of the number of incident particles rebound back indicates that the number of \(\alpha\)-particles undergoing head on collision is small. This, in turn, implies that the mass and positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a small volume. Rutherford scattering therefore, is a powerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus.

**Example 12.1**: In the Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, the nucleus (radius about \(10^{\text{-15}}\) m) is analogous to the sun about which the electron move in orbit (radius \(\approx 10^{\text{-10}}\) m) like the earth orbits around the sun. If the dimensions of the solar system had the same proportions as those of the atom, would the earth be closer to or farther away from the sun than actually it is? The radius of earth's orbit is about \(1.5\times 10^{\text{11}}\) m. The radius of sun is taken as \(7\times 10^{\text{8}}\) m.
**Solution** The ratio of the radius of electron's orbit to the radius of nucleus is \((10^{\text{-10}}\) m)/(\(10^{\text{-15}}\) m) = \(10^{\text{5}}\), that is, the radius of the electron's orbit is \(10^{\text{5}}\) times larger than the radius of nucleus. If the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun were \(10^{\text{5}}\) times larger than the radius of the sun, the radius of the earth's orbit would be \(10^{\text{5}}\times 7\times 10^{\text{8}}\) m = \(7\times 10^{\text{13}}\) m. This is more than 100 times greater than the actual orbital radius of earth. Thus, the earth would be much farther away from the sun.

It implies that an atom contains a much greater fraction of empty space than our solar system does.

**Example 12.2** In a Geiger-Marsden experiment, what is the distance of closest approach to the nucleus of a 7.7 MeV \(a\)-particle before it comes momentarily to rest and reverses its direction?

**Solution** The key idea here is that throughout the scattering process, the total mechanical energy of the system consisting of an \(\alpha\)-particle and a gold nucleus is conserved. The system's initial mechanical energy is \(E_{i}\) before the particle and nucleus interact, and it is equal to its mechanical energy \(E_{i}\) when the \(\alpha\)-particle momentarily stops. The initial energy \(E_{i}\) is just the kinetic energy \(K\)of the incoming \(\alpha\)- particle. The final energy \(E_{i}\)is just the electric potential energy \(U\) of the system. The potential energy \(U\) can be calculated from Eq. (12.1).

Let \(d\) be the centre-to-centre distance between the \(\alpha\)-particle and the gold nucleus when the \(\alpha\)-particle is at its stopping point. Then we can write the conservation of energy \(E_{i}\) = \(E_{j}\) as

\[K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{(2e)(Ze)}{d}=\frac{2Ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}d}\]

Thus the distance of closest approach \(d\) is given by

\[d=\frac{2Ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}K}\]

The maximum kinetic energy found in \(\alpha\)-particles of natural origin is 7.7 MeV or \(1.2\times 10^{-12}\) J. Since \(1/4\pi\epsilon_{0}\) = \(9.0\times 10^{9}\) N m\({}^{2}\)/C\({}^{2}\). Therefore with \(e=1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C, we have,

\[d=\frac{(2)(9.0\times 10^{9}\,\mbox{Nm}^{2}\,/\,C^{2})(1.6\times 10^{19}\, \mbox{C})^{2}\,\mbox{Z}}{1.2\times 10^{-12}\,\mbox{J}}\]

\[=3.84\times 10^{-16}\,\mbox{Z}\,\mbox{m}\]

The atomic number of foil material gold is \(Z=79\), so that

\[d\,(\mbox{Au})=3.0\times 10^{-14}\,\mbox{m}=30.\mbox{fm}\,\mbox{.}\,\,(1\,\mbox{fm }\,\,(\mbox{i.e,\,ferm})=10^{-15}\,\mbox{m}\,\mbox{.})\]

The radius of gold nucleus is, therefore, less than \(3.0\times 10^{-14}\) m. This is not in very good agreement with the observed result as the actual radius of gold nucleus is 6 fm. The cause of discrepancy is that the distance of closest approach is considerably larger than the sum of the radii of the gold nucleus and the \(\alpha\)-particle. Thus, the \(\alpha\)-particle reverses its motion without ever actually _touching_ the gold nucleus.

#### Electron orbits

The Rutherford nuclear model of the atom which involves classical concepts, pictures the atom as an electrically neutral sphere consisting of a very small, massive and positively charged nucleus at the centre surrounded by the revolving electrons in their respective dynamically stable orbits. The electrostatic force of attraction, \(F_{e}\)between the revolving electrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force \((F_{e})\) to keep them in their orbits. Thus, for a dynamically stable orbit in a hydrogen atom

\[F_{e}=F_{c}\]

\[\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \tag{12.2}\]Thus the relation between the orbit radius and the electron velocity is

\[r=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}mw^{2}} \tag{12.3}\]

The kinetic energy (\(K\)) and electrostatic potential energy (\(U\)) of the electron in hydrogen atom are

\[K=\frac{1}{2}mw^{2}=\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r}\text{ and }U=-\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r}\]

(The negative sign in \(U\) signifies that the electrostatic force is in the -\(r\) direction.) Thus the total energy \(E\) of the electron in a hydrogen atom is

\[E=K+U =\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r}-\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}\] \[\cdot\] \[=-\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \tag{12.4}\]

The total energy of the electron is negative, This implies the fact that the electron is bound to the nucleus. If \(E\) were positive, an electron will not follow a closed orbit around the nucleus.

\begin{tabular}{l} \end{tabular}

This gives the orbital radius

\[r=\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}E}=-\frac{(9\times 10^{9}\text{ N m}^{2}/\text{C}^{2})(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\text{C}^{2}}{(2)(-2.2\times 10^{-18}\text{ J})}\] \[=5.3\times 10^{-11}\text{ m}.\]

The velocity of the revolving electron can be computed from Eq. (12.3) with \(m=9.1\times 10^{-31}\text{ kg}\),

\[v=\frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}}=2.2\times 10^{6}\text{ m/s}.\]

### Atomic Spectra

As mentioned in Section 12.1, each element has a characteristic spectrum of radiation, which it emits. When an atomic gas or vapour is excited at low pressure, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths only. A spectrum of this kind is termed as emission line spectrum and it consists of bright lines on a dark background. The spectrum emitted by atomic hydrogen is shown in Fig. 12.5. Study of emission line spectra of a material can therefore serve as a type of "fingerprint" for identification of the gas. When white light passes through a gas and we analyse the transmitted light using a spectrometer we find some dark lines in the spectrum. These dark lines correspond precisely to those wavelengths which were found in the emission line spectrum of the gas. This is called the _absorption spectrum_ of the material of the gas.

### 12.4 Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom

The model of the atom proposed by Rutherford assumes that the atom, consisting of a central nucleus and revolving electron is stable much like sun-planet system which the model imitates. However, there are some fundamental differences between the two situations. While the planetary system is held by gravitational force, the nucleus-electron system being charged objects, interact by Coulomb's Law of force. We know that an object which moves in a circle is being constantly accelerated - the acceleration being centripetal in nature. According to classical electromagnetic theory, an accelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating electron should therefore, continuously decrease. The electron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the nucleus (Fig. 12.6). Thus, such an atom can not be stable. Further, according to the classical electromagnetic theory, the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of revolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular velocities and hence their frequencies would change continuously, and so will the frequency of the light emitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum, in contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed. Clearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story implying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to explain the atomic structure.

**Example 12.4**: According to the classical electromagnetic theory, calculate the initial frequency of the light emitted by the electron revolving around a proton in hydrogen atom.
**Solution** From Example 12.3 we know that velocity of electron moving around a proton in hydrogen atom in an orbit of radius 5.3 x 10\({}^{\text{-}11}\) m is 2.2 x 10\({}^{\text{-}6}\) m/s. Thus, the frequency of the electron moving around the proton is

\(\nu=\frac{v}{2\pi\nu}=\frac{2.2\times 10^{\text{-}6}\text{ m s}^{\text{-}1}}{2\pi (5.3\times 10^{\text{-}11}\text{ m})}\)

According to the classical electromagnetic theory we know that the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of its revolution around the nucleus. Thus the initial frequency of the light emitted is 6.6 x 10\({}^{\text{15}}\) Hz.

It was Niels Bohr (1885 - 1962) who made certain modifications in this model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum hypothesis. Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford's laboratory for several months in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford nuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in 1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in explaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes at the atomic scale. It became clear that a fairly radical departure from the established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism would be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation of atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early quantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates. These are :

* Bohr's first postulate was that _an electron in an atom could revolve in certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy_, contrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to this postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it

Figure 12.6: An accelerated atomic electron must spiral into the nucleus as it loses energy.

can exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are called the stationary states of the atom.
2. Bohr's second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate states that the _electron_ revolves around the nucleus _only in those orbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of \(h/2\pi\)_ where \(h\) is the Planck's constant (= \(6.6\times 10^{-34}\) J s). Thus the angular momentum (\(L\)) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is \(L=nh/2\pi\)
3. Bohr's third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early quantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein. It states that _an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency of the emitted photon is then given by_ \[h\nu=\ E_{i}-E_{j}\] (12.6) where \(E_{i}\) and \(E_{j}\) are the energies of the initial and final states and \(E_{i}>E_{j}\). For a hydrogen atom, Eq. (12.4) gives the expression to determine the energies of different energy states. But then this equation requires the radius \(r\) of the electron orbit. To calculate \(r\), Bohr's second postulate about the angular momentum of the electron-the quantisation condition - is used. The radius of \(n^{\rm th}\) possible orbit thus found is \(\cdot\) \(r_{n}=\left(\frac{n^{2}}{m}\right)\left(\frac{h}{2\pi}\right)^{2}\frac{4\pi e _{0}}{e^{2}}\) (12.7)

The total energy of the electron in the stationary states of the hydrogen atom can be obtained by substituting the value of orbital radius in Eq. (12.4) as

\[\cdot\ E_{n}=-\left(\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi e_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{m}{n^{2}}\right) \left(\frac{2\pi}{h}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi e_{0}}\right)\] (12.8) or \[E_{n}=-\frac{me^{4}}{8n^{2}e_{0}^{2}h^{2}}\] (12.8) Substituting values, Eq. (12.8) yields \[\cdot\ E_{n}=-\frac{2.18\times 10^{-18}}{n^{2}}\,{\rm J}\] (12.9) Atomic energies are often expressed in electron volts (eV) rather than joules. Since 1 eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-19}\) J, Eq. (12.9) can be rewritten as \[\cdot\ E_{n}=-\frac{13.6}{n^{2}}\ \ \ {\rm eV} \tag{12.10}\]

The negative sign of the total energy of an electron moving in an orbit means that the electron is bound with the nucleus. Energy will thus be required to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom to a distance infinitely far away from its nucleus (or proton in hydrogen atom).

#### Energy levels

The energy of an atom is the _least_ (largest negative value) when its electron is revolving in an orbit closest to the nucleus i.e., the one for which \(n=1\). For \(n=2\), \(3\),... the absolute value of the energy \(E\) is smaller, hence the energy is progressively larger in the outer orbits. The _lowest_ state of the atom, called the _ground state_, is that of the lowest energy, with the electron revolving in the orbit of smallest radius, the Bohr radius, \(\alpha_{0}\). The energy of this state (\(n=1\)), \(E_{1}\) is \(-13.6\) eV. Therefore, the minimum energy required to free the electron from the ground state of the hydrogen atom is \(13.6\) eV. It is called the _ionisation energy_ of the hydrogen atom. This prediction of the Bohr's model is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of ionisation energy.

At room temperature, most of the hydrogen atoms are in _ground state_. When a hydrogen atom receives energy by processes such as electron collisions, the atom may acquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher energy states. The atom is then said to be in an _excited state_. From Eq. (12.10), for \(n=2\); the energy \(E_{2}\) is \(-3.40\) eV. It means that the energy required to excite an electron in hydrogen atom to its first excited state, is an energy equal to \(E_{2}-E_{1}=3.40\) eV - (\(-13.6\)) eV = \(10.2\) eV. Similarly, \(E_{3}=-1\),\(51\) eV and \(E_{3}-E_{1}=12.09\) eV, or to excite the hydrogen atom from its ground state (\(n=1\)) to second excited state (\(n=3\)), \(12.09\) eV energy is required, and so on. From these excited states the electron can then fall back to a state of lower energy, emitting a photon in the process. Thus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases (that is as \(n\) increases) the value of minimum energy required to free the electron from the excited atom decreases.

The energy level diagram1 for the stationary states of a hydrogen atom, computed from Eq. (12.10), is given in Fig. 12.7. The principal quantum number \(n\) labels the stationary states in the ascending order of energy. In this diagram, the highest energy state corresponds to \(n=\infty\) in Eq, (12.10) and has an energy of \(0\) eV. This is the energy of the atom when the electron is completely removed (\(r=\infty\)) from the nucleus and is at rest. Observe how the energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as \(n\) increases.

Footnote 1: An electron can have any total energy above \(E=0\) eV. In such situations the electron is free. Thus there is a continuum of energy states above \(E=0\) eV, as shown in Fig. 12.7.

#### The Line Spectra of the Hydrogen Atom

According to the third postulate of Bohr's model, when an atom makes a transition from the higher energy state with quantum number \(n_{l}\) to the lower energy state with quantum number \(n_{g}(n_{g}<n_{l})\), the difference of energy is carried away by a photon of frequency \(v_{g}\) such that

Figure 12.7: The energy level diagram for the hydrogen atom. The electron in a hydrogen atom at room temperature spends most of its time in the ground state. To ionise a hydrogen atom an electron from the ground state, \(13.6\) eV of energy must be supplied. (The horizontal lines specify the presence of allowed energy states.)\(\begin{array}{c}\mbox{$h\!w_{\!g}$}=E_{\!n}-E_{\!nf}\\ \mbox{Since both $n_{\!j}$}\mbox{ and $n_{\!i}$}\mbox{ are integers, this immediately shows that in transitions between different atomic levels, light is radiated in various discrete frequencies.

The various lines in the atomic spectra are produced when electrons jump from higher energy state to a lower energy state and photons are emitted. These spectral lines are called emission lines. But when an atom absorbs a photon that has precisely the same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make transitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption. Thus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a rarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark spectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark lines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of the gas.

The explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr's model was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress towards the modern quantum theory. In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics.

### De Broglie's Explanation of Bohr's Second Postulate of Quantisation

Of all the postulates, Bohr made in his model of the atom, perhaps the most puzzling is his second postulate. It states that the angular momentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that is, \(L_{n}=nh/2\pi\); \(n=1_{\!i}\),\(2\); \(3\)...). Why should the angular momentum have only those values that are integral multiples of \(h/2\pi\)? The French physicist Louis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr proposed his model.

We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie's hypothesis that material particles, such as electrons, also have a wave nature. C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer later experimentally verified the wave nature of electrons in 1927. Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its circular orbit, as proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle wave. In analogy to waves travelling on a string, particle waves too can lead to standing waves under resonant conditions. From Chapter 14 of Class, XI Physics textbook, we know that when a string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are excited. However only those wavelengths survive which have nodes at the ends and form the standing wave in the string. It means that in a string, standing waves are formed when the total distance travelled by a wave down the string and back is one wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integral number of wavelengths. Waves with other wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes quickly drop to zero. For an electron moving in \(n^{\rm th}\) circular orbit of radius \(r_{n}\), the total distance is the circumference of the orbit, \(2\pi r_{n}\). Thus

Figure 12.8: A standing wave is shown on a circular orbit where four de Broglie wavelengths fit into the circumference of the orbit.

\[2\pi\ r_{n}=n\lambda,\ \ \ \ n=1,\,2,\,3... \tag{12.12}\]

Figure 12.8 illustrates a standing particle wave on a circular orbit for \(n=4\), i.e., \(2\pi r_{n}=4\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is the de Broglie wavelength of the electron moving in \(n^{\mathrm{th}}\) orbit. From Chapter 11, we have \(\lambda=h/p\), where \(p\) is the magnitude of the electron's momentum. If the speed of the electron is much less than the speed of light, the momentum is \(mw_{n}\). Thus, \(\lambda=h/\allowbreak mv_{n}\). From Eq. (12.12), we have

\[2\pi\ r_{n}=\ n\ h/mw_{n}\ \ \ \ \ \mathrm{or}\ \ \ \ m\ v_{n}r_{n}=\ nh/2\pi\]

This is the quantum condition proposed by Bohr for the angular momentum of the electron [Eq. (12.15)]. In Section 12.5, we saw that this equation is the basis of explaining the discrete orbits and energy levels in hydrogen atom. Thus de Broglie hypothesis provided an explanation for Bohr's second postulate for the quantisation of angular momentum of the orbiting electron. The quantised electron orbits and energy states are due to the wave nature of the electron and only resonant standing waves can persist.

Bohr's model, involving classical trajectory picture (planet-like electron orbiting the nucleus), correctly predicts the gross features of the hydrogenic atoms*, in particular, the frequencies of the radiation emitted or selectively absorbed. This model however has many limitations. Some are:

Footnote *: Hydrogenic atoms are the atoms consisting of a nucleus with positive charge +Ze and a single electron, where Z is the proton number. Examples are hydrogen atom, singly ionised helium, doubly ionised lithium, and so forth. In these atoms more complex electron-electron interactions are nonexistent.

(i) The Bohr model is applicable to hydrogenic atoms. It cannot be extended even to mere two electron atoms such as helium. The analysis of atoms with more than one electron was attempted on the lines of Bohr's model for hydrogenic atoms but did not meet with any success. Difficulty lies in the fact that each electron interacts not only with the positively charged nucleus but also with all other electrons.

The formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between positively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the electrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in multi-electron atoms.

(ii) While the Bohr's model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light emitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the relative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission spectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak intensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that some transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr's model is unable to account for the intensity variations.

Bohr's model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be generalised to complex atoms. For complex atoms we have to use a new and radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more complete picture of the atomic structure.

Summary

1. Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal amount of positive and negative charges.
2. In _Thomson's model_, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges with electrons embedded in it.
3. In _Rutherford's model_, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive charge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand the size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.
4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the structure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the accelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into the nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot explain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.
5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic spectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines termed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the atomic structure.
6. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability of atoms, Niel's Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single electron) atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of quantum mechanics: 1. In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits (called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy. 2. The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of \(h/2\pi\). (Bohr's quantisation condition.) That is \(L=nh/2\pi\), where \(n\) is an integer called the principal quantum number. 3. The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency (\(\nu\)) of the emitted photon is then given by \(h\nu=E_{i}-E_{f}\) An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits, in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher value of \(n\). 4. As a result of the quantisation condition of angular momentum, the electron orbits the nucleus at only specific radii. For a hydrogen atom it is given by \(r_{n}=\left(\frac{n^{2}}{m}\right)\left(\frac{h}{2\pi}\right)^{2}\frac{4\pi e _{0}}{e^{2}}\) The total energy is also quantised: \(E_{n}=-\frac{me^{4}}{8n^{2}\phi^{2}h^{2}}\) \(=-13.6\) eV/\(n^{2}\) The \(n=1\) state is called ground state. In hydrogen atom the ground state energy is \(-13.6\) eV. Higher values of \(n\) correspond to excited states (\(n>1\)). Atoms are excited to these higher states by collisions with other atoms or electrons or by absorption of a photon of right frequency.

* 8. de Broglie's hypothesis that electrons have a wavelength \(\lambda=h/mv\) gave an explanation for Bohr's quantised orbits by bringing in the wave-particle duality. The orbits correspond to circular standing waves in which the circumference of the orbit equals a whole number of wavelengths.
* 9. Bohr's model is applicable only to hydrogenic (single electron) atoms. It cannot be extended to even two electron atoms such as helium. This model is also unable to explain for the relative intensities of the frequencies emitted even by hydrogenic atoms.

## 1 Points to Ponder

1. Both the Thomson's as well as the Rutherford's models constitute an unstable system. Thomson's model is unstable electrostatically, while Rutherford's model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation of orbiting electrons.
2. What made Bohr quantised angular momentum (second postulate) and not some other quantity? Note, \(h\) has dimensions of angular momentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very relevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural!
3. The orbital picture in Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom was inconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern quantum mechanics in which Bohr's orbits are regions where the electron may be found with large probability.
4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet gravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational force of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so much greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron electric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-nucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the same order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr's model with its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms.
5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific orbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr's model include only one quantum number \(n\). The new theory called quantum mechanics supports Bohr's postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more generally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just one quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four quantum numbers (\(n\), \(l\), \(m\), and \(s\)), but for a pure Coulomb potential (as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on \(n\).
6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the frequency of revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to the frequency of spectral line. The later is the difference between two orbital energies divided by \(h\). For transitions between large quantum numbers (\(n\) to \(n\) - 1, \(n\) very large), however, the two coincide as expected.
7. Bohr's semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics and some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true picture of the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum mechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of fundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct, why do we better about it? The reasons which make Bohr's model still useful are:
Choose the correct alternative from the clues given at the end of the each statement:

1. The size of the atom in Thomson's model is........ the atomic size in Rutherford's model. (much greater than/no different from/much less than.)
2. In the ground state of........ electrons are in stable equilibrium, while in........ electrons always experience a net force. (Thomson's model/ Rutherford's model).
3. A _classical_ atom based on........ is doomed to collapse. (Thomson's model/ Rutherford's model.)
4. An atom has a nearly continuous mass distribution in a........ but has a highly non-uniform mass distribution in........ (Thomson's model). Rutherford's model)

## Chapter 13.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have learnt that in every atom, the positive charge and mass are densely concentrated at the centre of the atom forming its nucleus. The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller than those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of \(\alpha\)-particles demonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of about \(10^{4}\). This means the volume of a nucleus is about \(10^{-12}\) times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is almost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus would be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most (more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom.

Does the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does? If so, what are the constituents of the nucleus? How are these held together? In this chapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss various properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and also associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion.

### 13.2 Atomic Masses and Composition of Nucleus

The mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram: for example, the mass of a carbon atom, \({}^{12}\)C, is \(1.992647\times 10^{-26}\) kg. Kilogram is not a very convenient unit to measure such small quantities. Therefore, adifferent mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the atomic mass unit (u), defined as 1/12\({}^{\text{th}}\) of the mass of the carbon (\({}^{12}\)C) atom. According to this definition

\[\text{1u}=\frac{\text{mass of one }^{12}\text{C atom}}{12}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{1.992647\times 10^{-26}\text{ kg}}{12}\] \[\cdot\] \[=1.660539\times 10^{-27}\text{ kg} \tag{13.1}\]

The atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass unit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u.

Accurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass spectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence of different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same chemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same element differing in mass are called _isotopes_. (In Greek, isotope means the same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of elements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture of several isotopes. The relative abundance of different isotopes differs from element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having masses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. The relative abundances of these isotopes are 75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively. Thus, the average mass of a chlorine atom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two isotopes, which works out to be

\[\text{= }\frac{75.4\times 34.98+24.6\times 36.98}{100}\] \[\text{= }35.47\text{ u}\]

which agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine.

Even the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses 1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u. The nucleus of the lightest atom of hydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the proton. The mass of a proton is

\[m_{p}=1.00727\,\text{\AA}=1.67262\times 10^{-27}\text{ kg} \tag{13.2}\]

This is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus the mass of a single electron (\(m_{e}\)= 0.00055 u). The other two isotopes of hydrogen are called deuterium and tritium. Tritium nuclei, being unstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in laboratories.

The positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton carries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought that the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using arguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are outside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside the nucleus of the atom is \(Z\), the atomic number. The total charge of the atomic electrons is thus (-Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge of the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is, therefore, exactly \(Z\), the atomic number.

### Discovery of Neutron

Since the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they must contain only one proton each. But the masses of the nuclei of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3. Therefore, the nuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain, in addition to a proton, some neutral matter. The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei of these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately equal to one and two, respectively. This fact indicates that the nuclei of atoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a basic unit. This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick who observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were bombarded with alpha-particles (\(\alpha\)-particles are helium nuclei, to be discussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation could knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon and nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons (electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with \(\alpha\)-particles. The clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to assume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral particles called,_neutrons_, From conservation of energy and momentum, he was able to determine the mass of new particle 'as very nearly the same as mass of proton'.

The mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is

\[m_{n}=1.00866\,\mathrm{u}=1.6749\times 10^{-27}\,\mathrm{kg} \tag{13.3}\]

Chadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron.

A free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable. It decays into a proton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and has a mean life of about 1000s. It is, however, stable inside the nucleus.

The composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following terms and symbols:

_Z - atomic number = number of protons_ [13.4(a)]

_N - neutron number = number of neutrons_ [13.4(b)]

_A - mass number = Z + N_

= total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)]

One also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the number of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A.

Nuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation \({}^{A}_{Z}\)X where X is the chemical symbol of the species. For example, the nucleus of gold is denoted by \({}^{197}_{79}\,\mathrm{Au}\). It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons and the rest118 are neutrons.

The composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily explained. The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same number of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons. Deuterium, \({}^{2}_{1}\)H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton and one neutron. Its other isotope tritium, \({}^{3}_{1}\)H, contains one proton and two neutrons. The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from \(A\) = 173 to \(A\) = 204. We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements depend on their electronic structure. As the atoms of isotopes have identical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and are placed in the same location in the periodic table.

All nuclides with same mass number \(A\) are called _isobars_. For example, the nuclides \({}^{3}_{1}\)H and \({}^{3}_{2}\)He are isobars. Nuclides with same neutron number \(N\) but different atomic number \(Z\), for example \({}^{198}_{80}\)Hg and \({}^{197}_{79}\)Au, are called _isotones_.

### Size of the Nucleus

As we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who postulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At Rutherford's suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic experiment: on the scattering of \(\alpha\)-particles from thin gold foils. Their experiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold nucleus of an \(\alpha\)-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 x 10\({}^{-14}\) m. The scattering of \(\alpha\)-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by Rutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely responsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the nucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 x 10\({}^{-14}\) m.

If we use \(\alpha\)-particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of closest approach to the gold-nucleus will be smaller and at some point the scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces, and differ from Rutherford's calculations. Rutherford's calculations are based on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the \(\alpha\)-particle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set in, nuclear sizes can be inferred.

By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead of \(\alpha\)-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured.

It has been found that a nucleus of mass number \(A\) has a radius

\[R=R_{0}\,A^{1/3} \tag{13.5}\]

where \(R_{0}=1.2\times 10^{-15}\)m (=1.2 fm; 1 fm = 10\({}^{-15}\)m). This means the volume of the nucleus, which is proportional to \(R^{3}\) is proportional to \(A\). Thus the density of nucleus is a constant, independent of \(A\), for all nuclei. Different nuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear matter is approximately 2.3 x 10\({}^{17}\) kg m\({}^{-3}\). This density is very large compared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{-3}\). This is understandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty. Ordinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:784]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:785]

in the process. The energy \(E_{b}\) is called the _binding energy_ of the nucleus. If we separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to supply a total energy equal to \(E_{b}\), to those particles. Although we cannot tear apart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient measure of how well a nucleus is held together. A more useful measure of the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the _binding energy per nucleon_, \(E_{bn}\), which is the ratio of the binding energy \(E_{b}\) of a nucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus:

\[E_{bn}\ =\ E_{b}\ /\ A \tag{13.9}\]

We can think of binding energy per nucleon as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.

Figure 13.1 is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon \(E_{bn}\) versus the mass number \(A\) for a large number of nuclei. We notice the following main features of the plot:

(i) the binding energy per nucleon, \(E_{bn}\), is practically constant, i.e. practically independent of the atomic number for nuclei of middle mass number (30 < A < 170). The curve has a maximum of about 8.75 MeV for \(A\) = 56 and has a value of 7.6 MeV for \(A\) = 238.

(ii) \(E_{bn}\) is lower for both light nuclei (\(A\)<30) and heavy nuclei (\(A\)>170).

We can draw some conclusions from these two observations:

(i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon.

(ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider a particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus. It will be under the influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the range of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more than the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will have no influence on the binding energy of the nucleon under consideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of \(p\) neighbours within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be proportional to \(p\). Let the binding energy of the nucleus be \(p\)k, where \(k\) is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase \(A\) by adding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon inside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it and not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon would be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is approximately equal to \(p\)k. The property that a given nucleon influences only nucleons close to it is also referred to as saturation property of the nuclear force.
**(iii)**: A very heavy nucleus, say \(A=240\), has lower binding energy per nucleon compared to that of a nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a nucleus \(A=240\) breaks into two \(A=120\) nuclei, nucleons get more tightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process. It has very important implications for energy production through _fission_, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1.
**(iv)**: Consider two very light nuclei (\(A\!\leq\!10\)) joining to form a heavier nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei is more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei. This means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial system. Again energy would be released in such a process of _fusion_. This is the energy source of sun, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.2.

### Nuclear Force

The force that determines the motion of atomic electrons is the familiar Coulomb force. In Section 13.4, we have seen that for average mass nuclei the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8 MeV, which is much larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a nucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally different kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and neutrons into the tiny nuclear volume. We have already seen that the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be understood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the nuclear binding force are summarised below. These are obtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930 to 1950.

**(i)**: The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force.
**(ii)**: The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This leads to _saturation of forces_ in a medium or a large-sized nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the binding energy per nucleon.

A rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2. The potential energy is a minimum at a distance \(r_{0}\) of about 0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger than 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less than 0.8 fm.

* [iii] The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge. Unlike Coulomb's law or the Newton's law of gravitation there is no simple mathematical form of the nuclear force.

### Radioactivity

A. H. Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident. While studying the fluorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated with visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon. After illuminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible light, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a photographic plate by a piece of silver. When, after several hours of exposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening due to something that must have been emitted by the compound and was able to penetrate both black paper and the silver.

Experiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay. This is referred to as _radioactive decay_, Three types of radioactive decay occur in nature :

* \(\alpha\)-decay in which a helium nucleus \({}_{1}\)He is emitted;
* \(\beta\)-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass as electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron) are emitted;
* \(\gamma\)-decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are emitted.

### Nuclear Energy

The curve of binding energy per nucleon \(E_{bn}\), given in Fig. 13.1, has a long flat middle region between \(A\) = 30 and \(A\) = 170. In this region the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For the lighter nuclei region, \(A\) < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region, \(A\) > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we have noted earlier. Now, the greater the binding energy, the less is the total mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei with less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding energy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a heavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments (_fission_) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus (_fusion_.)

Exothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources such as coal or petroleum. Here the energies involved are in the range of electron volts. On the other hand, in a nuclear reaction, the energy release is of the order of MeV. Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source. Fission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 10\({}^{14}\) J of energy; compare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 10\({}^{7}\) J.

#### 13.7.1 Fission

New possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays and study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear particles such as proton, neutron, \(\alpha\)-particle, etc.

A most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is fission. An example of fission is when a uranium isotope \({}^{235}_{~{}~{}~{}~{}99}\)U bombarded with a neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments

\({}^{1}\)n + \({}^{235}_{~{}~{}~{}92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{236}_{~{}~{}~{}92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{144}_{~{}~{}~{}96}\)Ba + \({}^{89}_{~{}~{}~{}36}\)Kr + \({}^{1}_{~{}~{}~{}0}\)n

The same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass fragments

\({}^{1}\)n + \({}^{235}_{~{}~{}~{}92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{236}_{~{}~{}~{}92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{133}_{~{}~{}~{}51}\)Sb + \({}^{99}_{~{}~{}~{}41}\)Nb + \({}^{1}_{~{}~{}~{}0}\)n

Or, as another example,

\({}^{1}\)n + \({}^{235}_{~{}~{}~{}92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{140}_{~{}~{}~{}54}\)Xe + \({}^{94}_{~{}~{}~{}38}\)Sr + \({}^{1}_{~{}~{}~{}0}\)n

The fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit \(\beta\) particles in succession to achieve stable end products.

The energy released (the \(\beta\) value ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like uranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is estimated as follows:

Let us take a nucleus with \(A\) = 240 breaking into two fragments each of \(A\) = 120. Then

\(E_{bn}\) for \(A\) = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV,

\(E_{bn}\) for the two \(A\) = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV.

\(\therefore\) Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV.

Hence the total gain in binding energy is 240\(\times\)0.9 or 216 MeV.

The disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic energy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the surrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear reactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous energy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear fission.

#### 13.7.2 Nuclear fusion - energy generation in stars

When two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released, since the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1. Some examples of such energy liberating nuclear fusion reactions are :

\({}^{1}\)H + \({}^{1}_{~{}~{}1}\)H \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{2}_{~{}~{}1}\)H + \(e^{+}\) + \(\nu\) + 0.42 MeV

\({}^{2}\)H + \({}^{2}_{~{}~{}1}\)H \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{3}_{~{}~{}2}\)He + \(n\) + 3.27 MeV

\({}^{2}\)H + \({}^{2}_{~{}~{}1}\)H \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{3}_{~{}~{}1}\)H + \({}^{1}_{~{}~{}1}\)H + 4.03 MeV

In the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and a positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.13(b)], twodeuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction (13.13c), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For fusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that attractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However, since they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb repulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this coulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and radii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that the barrier height for two protons is \(\sim\) 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei with higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two protons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to overcome the coulomb barrier:

\((3/2)k\ T=K\simeq 400\) keV, which gives T \(\sim\) 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{9}\) K.

When fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so that particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb repulsive behaviour, it is called _thermonuclear fusion_.

Thermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior of stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of 1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{7}\) K, which is considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion of particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons whose energies are much above the average energy.

The fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the hydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen in its core. The _proton-proton_ (p, p) _cycle_ by which this occurs is represented by the following sets of reactions:

\[{}^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}+{}^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}-{}^{2}_{1}\mathrm{H}+e^{+}+v+0.42\ \mathrm{MeV} \tag{13.14}\]

For the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur twice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium nucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net effect is

\[\mathrm{or}\ \ (\mathrm{4}^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{4}e^{-})\rightarrow\mathrm{ 4}^{2}_{2}\mathrm{He}+2v+6\gamma+26.7\ \mathrm{MeV} \tag{13.15}\]

Thus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an \({}^{4}_{2}\mathrm{He}\) atom with a release of 26.7 MeV of energy.

Helium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior of a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes helium, the core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity which increases the temperature of the core. If this temperature increases to about 10\({}^{8}\) K, fusion takes place again, this time of helium nuclei into carbon. This kind of process can generate through fusion higher and higher mass number elements. But elements more massive than those near the peak of the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1 cannot be so produced.

The age of the sun is about 5x10\({}^{9}\) y and it is estimated that there is enough hydrogen in the sun to keep it going for another 5 billion years. After that, the hydrogen burning will stop and the sun will begin to cool and will start to collapse under gravity, which will raise the core temperature. The outer envelope of the sun will expand, turning it into the so called _red giant_.

#### Controlled thermonuclear fusion

The natural thermonuclear fusion process in a star is replicated in a thermonuclear fusion device. In controlled fusion reactors, the aim is to generate steady power by heating the nuclear fuel to a temperature in the range of 10\({}^{8}\) K. At these temperatures, the fuel is a mixture of positive ions and electrons (plasma). The challenge is to confine this plasma, since no container can stand such a high temperature. Several countries around the world including India are developing techniques in this connection. If successful, fusion reactors will hopefully supply almost unlimited power to humanity.

**Example 13.4**: Answer the following questions:

1. Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in Section 13.7) 'balanced' in the sense a chemical equation (e.g., 2H\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2 H\({}_{2}\)O) is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on both sides?
2. If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are conserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted into energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction?
3. A general impression exists that mass-energy interconversion takes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical reaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain.

**Solution**

1. A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. A chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus, the number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved in a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the number of neutrons, are both separately conserved in a nuclear reaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of very high energies - what is strictly conserved is the total charge and total baryon number'. We need not pursue this matter here.] In nuclear reactions (e.g., Eq. 13.10), the number of protons and the number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.
2. We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative contribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same on either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand side. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy released or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy contributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass of nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa. It is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass-energy interconversion. 3. From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical reaction is similar to a nuclear reaction _in principle_. The energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the difference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energy or vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is _incorrect_) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction.

## Summary

1. An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius of the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of \(10^{4}\). More than 99.99% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
2. On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By definition, 1 atomic mass unit (1u) is \(1/12^{\rm{m}}\) mass of one atom of \({}^{12}\)C; 1u = \(1.660563\times 10^{-20}\)kg.
3. A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost the same as that of proton
4. The atomic number \(Z\) is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of an element. The mass number \(A\) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus; \(A=Z+N\); Here \(N\) denotes the number of neutrons in the nucleus. \(A\) nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as \(\stackrel{{ A}}{{Z}}\)X, where X is the chemical symbol of the species. Nuclides with the same atomic number \(Z\), but different neutron number \(N\) are called _isotopes_. Nuclides with the same \(A\) are _isobars_ and those with the same \(N\) are _isotones_. Most elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass of an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes and calculated in accordance to the relative abundances of the isotopes.
5. A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a radius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the nuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula \(R=R_{0}\,A^{1/3}\), where \(R_{0}\) = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density is independent of \(A\). It is of the order of \(10^{17}\) kg/m\({}^{3}\).
6. Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong nuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron and proton.

7. The nuclear mass \(M\) is always less than the total mass, \(\Sigma m\), of its constituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents is called the _mass defect_, \(\Delta M=(Z\,m_{p}+(A-Z)m_{v})-M\) Using Einstein's mass energy relation, we express this mass difference in terms of energy as \(\Delta E_{v}=\Delta M\,c^{2}\) The energy \(\Delta E_{v}\) represents the _binding energy_ of the nucleus. In the mass number range \(A=30\) to \(170\), the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant, about \(8\) MeV/nucleon.
8. Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times larger than chemical process.
9. The \(\mathcal{G}\)-value of a nuclear process is \(\mathcal{G}\) = final kinetic energy - initial kinetic energy. Due to conservation of mass-energy, this is also, \(\mathcal{G}\) = (sum of initial masses - sum of final masses)\(c^{2}\)
10. Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species transform by giving out \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\) or \(\gamma\) rays: \(a\)-rays are helium nuclei, \(\beta\)-rays are electrons. \(\gamma\)-rays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than \(X\)-rays.
11. Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into more tightly bound nuclei. In fission, a heavy nucleus like \({}^{235}_{\alpha\beta}\) U breaks into two smaller fragments, e.g., \({}^{235}_{\beta\beta}\)U+n \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{133}_{\beta\beta}\)Sb + \({}^{99}_{4\beta}\)Nb + \({}^{4}_{0}\)in
12. In fusion, lighter nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus, Fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei is the source of energy of all stars including our sun.

## 6 Points to Ponder

1. The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus. The mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.
2. The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to be slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering. This is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of the nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear matter.
3. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, \(E=mc^{2}\), we cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of conservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that this principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is central to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a source of power. Using the principle, \(\mathcal{G}\) of a nuclear process (decay or reaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.
4. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that exothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse or when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate mass.
5. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to overcome the coulomb potential barrier. That is why fusion requires very high temperatures.
6. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly varying, it shows peaks at nuclides like \({}^{4}\)He, \({}^{16}\)O etc. This is considered as evidence of atom-like shell structure in nuclei.
7. Electron and positron are a particle-antiparticle pair. They are identical in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite. (It is found that when an electron and a positron come together, they annihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.)
8. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability requires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light nuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. (More neutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the protons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei which have an excess of neutrons or protons are unstable. In fact, only about 10% of xenon isotopes (of all elements), are stable. Others have been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding \(\alpha\), p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or identified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the basic _building blocks_ of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes - cathode, plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes). In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and the controlled flow of these electrons _in vacuum_ is obtained by varying the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as _valves_. These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate generally at high voltages (\(\sim\)100 V) and have limited life and low reliability. The seed of the development of modern _solid-state semiconductor electronics_ goes back to 1930's when it was realised that some solid-state semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling the number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them. Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supplyand flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are _within the solid itself_, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an _evacuated_ space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability. Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of _galena_ (Lead sulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as _detector_ of radio waves.

In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a 3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also be described.

### 14.2 Classification of Metals, Conductors and Semiconductors

On the basis of conductivity

On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (\(\sigma\)) or resistivity (\(\rho\) = 1/\(\sigma\)), the solids are broadly classified as:

**(i)**: _Metals:_ They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity).

\(\rho\)\(\sim\)\(10^{-2}\)\(-10^{-8}\)\(\Omega\) m

\(\sigma\)\(\sim\)\(10^{2}\)\(-10^{8}\) S m\({}^{-1}\)
**(ii)**: _Semiconductors:_ They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate to metals and insulators.

\(\rho\)\(\sim\)\(10^{-5}\)\(-10^{6}\)\(\Omega\) m

\(\sigma\)\(\sim\)\(10^{5}\)\(-10^{-6}\) S m\({}^{-1}\)
**(iii)**: _Insulators:_ They have high resistivity (or low conductivity).

\(\rho\)\(\sim\)\(10^{11}\)\(-10^{19}\)\(\Omega\) m

\(\sigma\)\(\sim\)\(10^{-11}\)\(-10^{-19}\) S m\({}^{-1}\)

The values of \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) given above are indicative of magnitude and could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which will become clear as we go along in this chapter.

Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which could be:

**(i)**: _Elemental semiconductors_: Si and Ge
**(ii)**: _Compound semiconductors_: Examples are:

* Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.
* Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.
* Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.

Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound _inorganic_ semiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices usingorganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been developed signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-electronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict ourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly elemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply to most of the compound semiconductors as well.

### On the basis of energy bands

According to the Bohr atomic model, in an _isolated atom_ the energy of any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very close or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.

Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because of this, each electron will have a different _energy level_. These different energy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called _energy bands_. The energy band which includes the energy levels of the valence electrons is called the _valence band_. The energy band above the valence band is called the _conduction band_. With no external energy, all the valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is the case with metallic conductors.

If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons are available in the conduction band. This makes the material an insulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the valence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band. At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band where other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as due to vacancies in the valence band.

Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing \(N\) atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (\(n\) = 3), while for Ge it is the fourth orbit (\(n\)= 4). The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4 (2\(s\) and 2\(p\) electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4\(N\). The maximum possible number of electrons in the outer orbit is 8 (2\(s\) + 6\(p\) electrons). So, for the 4\(N\) valence electrons there are 8\(N\) available energy states. These 8\(N\)discrete energy levels can either form a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands depending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box on Band Theory of Solids).

At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge, the energy band of these 8\(N\) states is split apart into two which are separated by an _energy gap_\(E_{g}\) (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is completely occupied by the 4\(N\) valence electrons at temperature of absolute zero is the _valence band_. The other band consisting of 4\(N\) energy states, called the _conduction band_, is completely empty and is also quite zero.

The lowest energy level in the conduction band is shown as \(E_{\text{\tiny{C}}}\) and highest energy level in the valence band is shown as \(E_{\text{\tiny{V}}}\). Above \(E_{\text{\tiny{C}}}\) and below \(E_{\text{\tiny{V}}}\) there are a large number of closely spaced energy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.

The gap between the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band is called the _energy band gap_ (Energy gap \(E_{g}\)). It may be large, small, or zero, depending upon the material. These different situations, are depicted in Fig. 14.2 and discussed below:

_Case I:_ This refers to a situation, as shown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a metal either when the conduction band is partially filled and the balanced band is partially empty or when the conduction and valance bands overlap. When there is overlap electrons from valence band can easily move into the conduction band. This situation makes a large number of electrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials is low or the conductivity is high.

Figure 14.2: Difference between energy bands of (a) metals, (b) insulators and (c) semiconductors.

Figure 14.1: The energy band positions in a semiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the conduction band, consists of infinitely large number of closely spaced energy states. The lower band, called the valence band, consists of closely spaced completely filled energy states.

_Case II:_ In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap \(E_{g}\) exists (\(E_{g}>3\) eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore no electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large that electrons cannot be excited from the valence band to the conduction band by thermal excitation. This is the case of _insulators_.

_Case III:_ This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small band gap (\(E_{g}<3\) eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room temperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough energy to cross the energy gap and enter the _conduction band_. These electrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band. Hence, the resistance of _semiconductors_ is not as high as that of the insulators.

In this section we have made a broad classification of metals, conductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will learn the conduction process in semiconductors.

### Intrinsic Semiconductor

We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures are called the diamond-like structures. Each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline structure, every Si or Ge atom tends _to share_ one of its four valence electrons with each of its four nearest neighbour atoms, and also _to take share_ of one electron from each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs are referred to as forming a _covalent bond_ or simply a _valence bond_. The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly. Figure 14.4 schematically shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si or Ge structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the covalent bond. It shows an idealised picture in which no bonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation arises at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of these electrons may break-away (becoming _free_ electrons contributing to conduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the crystalline lattice and creates a _vacancy_ in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge -\(q\)) has come out leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+\(q\)). This _vacancy_ with the effective positive electronic charge is called a _hole_. The hole behaves as an _apparent free particle_ with effective positive charge.

In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, \(n_{\rm e}\)is equal to the number of holes, \(n_{\rm h}\). That is

\[n_{\rm e}=n_{\rm h}=n_{\rm i} \tag{14.1}\]

where \(n_{\rm i}\)is called intrinsic carrier concentration.

Semiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from electrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be visualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron from the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to the vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump, the hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an electron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has moved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron originally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved in this process of hole motion. The free electron moves completely independently as conduction electron and gives rise to an electron current, \(I_{e}\) under an applied electric field. Remember that the motion of hole is only a convenient way of describing the actual motion of _bound_ electrons, whenever there is an empty bond anywhere in the crystal. Under the action of an electric field, these holes move towards negative potential giving the hole current, \(I_{h}\). The total current, \(I\) is thus the sum of the electron current \(I_{e}\) and the hole current \(I_{h}\):

\[I=I_{e}+I_{h} \tag{14.2}\]

It may be noted that apart from the _process of generation_ of conduction electrons and holes, a simultaneous _process of recombination_ occurs in which the electrons _recombine_ with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of generation is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The recombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.

Figure 14.5: (a) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron due to thermal energy at moderate temperatures. (b) Simplified representation of possible thermal motion of a hole. The electron from the lower left hand covalent bond (site 2) goes to the earlier hole site1, leaving a hole at its site indicating an apparent movement of the hole from site 1 to site 2.

An intrinsic semiconductor will behave like an insulator at \(T\)= 0 K as shown in Fig. 14.6(a). It is the thermal energy at higher temperatures (\(T\) > 0K), which excites some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These thermally excited electrons at \(T\) > 0 K, partially occupy the conduction band. Therefore, the energy-band diagram of an intrinsic semiconductor will be as shown in Fig. 14.6(b). Here, some electrons are shown in the conduction band. These have come from the valence band leaving equal number of holes there.

**Example 14.1**: C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C insulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors?
**Solution**: The 4 bonding electrons of C; Si or Ge lie, respectively, in the second, third and fourth orbit. Hence, energy required to take out an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy \(E_{g}\)) will be least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free electrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly small for C.

### 14.4 Extrinsic Semiconductor

The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its temperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As such, no important electronic devices can be developed using these semiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their conductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.

When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable impurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the semiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as _extrinsic semiconductors_ or _impurity semiconductors_. The deliberate addition of a desirable impurity is called _doping_ and the impurity atoms are called _dopants_. Such a material is also called a _doped semiconductor_. The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure semiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original semiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain this is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should be nearly the same.

There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si or Ge:

(i) [noitemsep] (relaxant (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous (P), etc.

* Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In), Boron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc.

We shall now discuss how the doping changes the number of charge carriers (and hence the conductivity) of semiconductors. Si or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the Periodic table and, therefore, we choose the dopant element from nearby fifth or third group, expecting and taking care that the size of the dopant atom is nearly the same as that of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent and trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two entirely different types of semiconductors as discussed below.

### (i) n-type semiconductor

Suppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent element as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom of +5 valency element occupies the position of an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of its electrons bond with the four silicon neighbours while the fifth remains very weakly bound to its parent atom. This is because the four electrons participating in bonding are seen as part of the effective core of the atom by the fifth electron. As a result the ionisation energy required to set this electron free is very small and even at room temperature it will be free to move in the lattice of the semiconductor. For example, the energy required is \(\sim\) 0.01 eV for germanium, and 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this electron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump the forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for silicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor. Thus, the pentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and hence is known as _donor_ impurity. The number of electrons made available for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the doping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature. On the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number of holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.

In a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons \(n_{e}\) is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated intrinsically, while the total number of holes \(n_{h}\) is only due to the holes from the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would increase due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the number of holes would get reduced further.

Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons can be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons become the _majority carriers_ and holes the _minority carriers_. These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-_type semiconductors_. For n-type semiconductors, we have,

\[n_{e}>>n_{h} \tag{14.3}\]

_(ii) p-type semiconductor_

This is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity like Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than Si or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with neighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to offer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth neighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice wants an electron in place of a hole, an electron in the outer orbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this vacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the _hole_ is available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom becomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth electron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom of p-type material can be treated as _core of one negative charge_ along with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is obvious that one _acceptor_ atom gives one _hole_. These holes are in addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source of conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for such a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped with trivalent impurity are called p-_type semiconductors_. For p-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce the number (n)of intrinsically generated electrons to \(n_{e}\). We have, for p-type semiconductors

\[n_{h}>>n_{e} \tag{14.4}\]

Note that _the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality as the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and opposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice_.

In extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of majority current carriers, the minority carriers produced thermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and thus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of current carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly helps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.

The semiconductor's energy band structure is affected by doping. In the case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor impurities (\(E_{D}\)) and acceptor impurities (\(E_{A}\)) also exist. In the energy band diagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level \(E_{D}\) is slightly below the bottom \(E_{\rm C}\) of the conduction band and electrons from this level move into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room temperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (\(\sim\)10\({}^{12}\)) atoms of Si get ionised. So the conduction band will have most electrons coming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly,

Figure 14.8: (a) Trivalent acceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.) doped in tetravalent Si or Ge lattice giving p-type semiconductor. (b) Commonly used schematic representation of p-type material which shows only the fixed core of the substituent acceptor with one effective additional negative charge and its associated hole.

for p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level \(E_{A}\) is slightly above the top \(E_{\rm v}\) of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9(b). With very small supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level \(E_{A}\) and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that with very small supply of energy the hole from level \(E_{A}\) sinks down into the valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain external energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get ionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the density of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in the extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a semiconductor _in thermal equilibrium_ is given by

\[n_{\rm e}n_{\rm h}=n_{\rm i}^{2} \tag{14.5}\]

Though the above description is grossly approximate and hypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals, insulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple manner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon the energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C (diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5:4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV, respectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the energy gap in its case is 0 eV.

**Example 14.2**: Suppose a pure Si crystal has \(5\times 10^{28}\) atoms m-3. It is doped by 1 ppm concentration of pentavalent As. Calculate the number of electrons and holes. Given that \(n_{\rm i}=\)1.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{16}\) m-3.

**Solution** Note that thermally generated electrons (\(n_{\rm i}\) -10\({}^{16}\) m-3) are negligibly small as compared to those produced by doping. Therefore, \(n_{\rm e}\thickapprox N_{\rm D}\).

Since \(n_{\rm e}n_{\rm h}\) = \(n_{\rm i}^{2}\). The number of holes

\(n_{\rm h}\) = (2.25 \(\times\) 10\({}^{32}\))/(5 \(\times\)10\({}^{22}\))

\(\sim\) 4.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{9}\) m-3

### 14.5 p-n Junction

A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor, etc. A clear understanding of the junction behaviour is important to analyse the working of other semiconductor devices. We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the junction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage (also called _bias_).

#### 14.5.1 p-n junction formation

Consider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding precisely a small quantity of pentavelement impurity, part of the p-Si wafer can be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a semiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.

Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: _diffusion_ and _drift_. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration of electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the concentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side (p \(\rightarrow\) n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n \(\rightarrow\) p). This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.

When an electron diffuses from n \(\rightarrow\) p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse from n \(\rightarrow\) p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on n-side of the junction is developed.

Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p \(\rightarrow\) n due to the concentration gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is immobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or negative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed. This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known as _depletion region_ as the electrons and holes taking part in the initial movement across the junction _depleted_ the region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness of depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and negative space charge region on p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from positive charge towards negative charge develops. Due to this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p-side. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field is called drift. Thus a drift current, which is opposite in direction to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts.

Figure 14.10: p-n junction formation process.

Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small. As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric field strength and hence drift current. This process continues until the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n junction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there is _no net_ current.

The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of electron by the p-region causes a difference of potential across the junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is such as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of equilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at equilibrium and the potential across the junction. The n-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired electrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p material. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of electron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a _barrier potential_.

### 14.6 Semiconductor Diode

A semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage. It is a two terminal device. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12(b).

The direction of arrow indicates the conventional direction of current [when the diode is under forward bias]. The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered by applying an external voltage \(V\) across the diode. The situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium (without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b).

### 14.6 p-n junction diode under forward bias

When an external voltage \(V\) is applied across a semiconductor diode such that p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side to the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be _forward biased_.

The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the voltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible. (This is because the resistance of the depletion region - a region where there are no charges - is very high compared to the resistance of n-side and p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (_V_) is opposite to the

Figure 14.12: (a) Semiconductor diode, situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium (without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b).

built-in potential \(V_{\rm o}\). As a result, the depletion layer width decreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The effective barrier height under forward bias is (\(V_{\rm o}-V\)).

If the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a small number of carriers in the material--those that happen to be in the uppermost energy levels--will possess enough energy to cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced and more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus the current increases.

Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the depletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority carries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach the n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under forward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the junction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier concentration increases significantly compared to the locations far from the junction.

Due to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end of p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the junction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side (Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side gives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to electron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually in mA.

#### 14.6.2 p-n junction diode under reverse bias

When an external voltage (\(V\)) is applied across the diode such that n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be _reverse biased_ [Fig. 14.15(a)]. The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same as the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field. The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (\(V_{\rm o}+V\)), [Fig. 14.15(b)]. This suppresses the flow of electrons from \(\rm n\to p\) and holes from \(\rm p\to n\). Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode under forward bias.

The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers gives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few \(\rm\mu A\). This is quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority side to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also there under forward bias but it is negligible (\(\rm\mu A\)) when compared with current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.

The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current is not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is limited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either side of the junction.

The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage independent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as breakdown voltage (\(V_{br}\)). When \(V\) = \(V_{br}\), the diode reverse current increases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes large change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by an external circuit below the rated value (specified by the manufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds the rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This can happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward current exceeds the rated value.

The circuit arrangement for studying the \(V\)-\(I\) characteristics of a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied voltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b). The battery is connected to the diode through a potentiometer (or relioestat) so that the applied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values of voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between \(V\) and \(I\) is obtained as in Fig. 14.16(c). Note that in forward bias measurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large (as explained in the earlier section) while a micrometer is used in reverse bias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16(c) that in forward

bias, the current first increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the voltage across the diode crosses a certain value. After the characteristic voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the _threshold voltage_ or cut-in voltage (\(\sim\)0.2V for germanium diode and \(\sim\)0.7 V for silicon diode).

For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (\(\sim\)\(\mu\)A) and almost remains constant with change in bias. It is called _reverse saturation current_. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not used beyond the reverse saturation current region.

The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly allows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next section. For diodes, we define a quantity called _dynamic resistance_ as the ratio of small change in voltage \(\Delta\)V to a small change in current \(\Delta\)I:

\[r_{a}=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}\]

**Example 14.4** The _V-I_ characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in the Fig. 14.17. Calculate the resistance of the diode at (a) \(I_{D}=15\) mA and (b) \(V_{D}=-10\) V.

**Solution** Considering the diode characteristics as a straight line between \(I=10\) mA to \(I=20\) mA passing through the origin, we can calculate the resistance using Ohm's law.

(a) From the curve, at \(I=20\) mA, \(V=0.8\) V; \(I=10\) mA, \(V=0.7\) V

\(r_{lb}=\Delta V/\Delta I=0.1\)V/\(10\) mA = \(10\)\(\Omega\)

(b) From the curve at V = \(-10\) V, \(I=-1\)\(\mu\)A,

Therefore,

\(r_{rb}=10\) V/\(1\mu\)A= \(1.0\times 10^{7}\)\(\Omega\)

### 14.7 Application of Junction Diode as a Rectifier

From the _V-I_ characteristic of a junction diode we see that it allows current to pass only when it is forward biased. So if an alternating voltage is applied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle when the diode is forward biased. This property is used _to rectify_ alternating voltages and the circuit used for this purpose is called a _rectifier_.

If an alternating voltage is applied across a diode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will appear across the load only during the half cycles of the ac input during which the diode is forward biased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in Fig. 14.18, is called a _half-wave rectifier_. The secondary of a transformer supplies the desired ac voltage across terminals, A and B. When the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is reverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse saturation current of a diode is negligible and can be considered equal to zero for practical purposes.

The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must be sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at the secondary of the transformer to protect the diode from reverse breakdown.)

Therefore, in the positive _half-cycle_ of ac there is a current through the load resistor \(R_{L}\) and we get an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b), whereas there is no current in the negative half-cycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get the output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is restricted to _only one direction_ and is said to be _rectified_. Since the rectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is called as _half-wave rectifier_.

The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output rectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative half of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as _full-wave rectifier_. Here the p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the transformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the output is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint of the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the secondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it is called _centre-tap transformer_. As can be seen from Fig. 14.19(c) the voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage. Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate cycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-tap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that there is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-tap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A

Figure 14.18: (a) Half-wave rectifier circuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output voltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit.

with respect to the centre tap at any instant is positive. It is clear that, at that instant, voltage at B being out of phase will be negative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode D1 gets forward biased and conducts (while D2 being reverse biased is not conducting). Hence, during this positive half cycle we get an output current (and a output voltage across the load resistor \(R_{L}\)) as shown in Fig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle when the voltage at A becomes negative with respect to centre tap, the voltage at B would be positive. In this part of the cycle diode D1 would not conduct but diode D2 would, giving an output current and output voltage (across \(R_{L}\)) during the negative half cycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output voltage during both the positive as well as the negative half of the cycle. Obviously, this is a more efficient circuit for getting rectified voltage or current than the half-wave rectifier.

The rectified voltage is in the form of pulses of the shape of half sinusoids. Though it is unidirectional it does not have a steady value. To get steady dc output from the pulsating voltage normally a capacitor is connected across the output terminals (parallel to the load \(R_{L}^{\prime}\)). One can also use an inductor in series with \(R_{L}^{\prime}\) for the same purpose. Since these additional circuits appear to _filter_ out the _ac ripple_ and give a _pure dc_ voltage, so they are called filters.

Now we shall discuss the role of capacitor in filtering. When the voltage across the capacitor is rising, it gets charged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage of the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through the load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of rectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The rate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the product of capacitance \(C\) and the effective resistance \(R_{L}\) used in the circuit and is called the _time constant_. To make the time constant large value of \(C\) should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The _output voltage_ obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the _peak voltage_ of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely used in power supplies.

## Summary

* 1 Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state electronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs; etc.
* 2 Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements decide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or semiconductor.
* 3 Metals have low resistivity (\(10^{-4}\) to \(10^{8}\)\(\Omega\) m), insulators have very high resistivity (\(>10^{8}\)\(\Omega\) m\({}^{-1}\)), while semiconductors have intermediate values of resistivity.
* 4 Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs, CdS, etc.).
* 5 Pure semiconductors are called 'intrinsic semiconductors'. The presence of charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an 'intrinsic' property of the material and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The number of electrons (\(n_{e}\)) is equal to the number of holes (\(n_{h}\)) in intrinsic conductors, Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective positive charge.
* 6 The number of charge carriers can be changed by 'doping of a suitable impurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as extrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).
* 7 In n-type semiconductors, \(n_{e}\)\(>\)\(n_{h}\) while in p-type semiconductors \(n_{h}\)\(>\)\(n_{c}\)
* 8 n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent atoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained by doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.
* 9 \(n_{e}n_{h}=n_{i}^{2}\) in all cases. Further, the material possesses an _overall charge neutrality_.
* 10 There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and conduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence band energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All energy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the conduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in the conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for the conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy gap (\(E_{q}\)) between the top of valence band (\(E_{v}\)) and the bottom of the conduction band \(E_{C}\). The electrons from valence band can be excited by

heat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce a change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.
* For insulators \(E_{g}\)\(>\) 3 eV, for semiconductors \(E_{g}\) is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while for metals \(E_{g}\)\(\approx\) 0.
* p-n junction is the 'key' to all semiconductor devices. When such a junction is made, a 'depletion layer' is formed consisting of immobile ion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a junction potential barrier.
* By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be changed. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the battery and p-side is connected to the positively, the barrier is decreased while the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current is more (mA) while it is very small (mA) in a p-n junction diode.
* Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage to one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc voltage can be obtained.

## 10 Points to Ponder

1. The energy bands (\(E_{C}\) or \(E_{v}\)) in the semiconductors are space delocalised which means that these are not located in any specific place inside the solid. The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in which \(E_{C}\) or \(E_{v}\) are drawn as straight lines, then they should be respectively taken simply as the _bottom_ of conduction band energy levels and _top_ of valence band energy levels.
2. In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n-type or p-type semiconductors are obtained by introducing 'dopants' as defects. In compound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio can also change the type of semiconductor. For example, in ideal GaAs the ratio of Ga:As is 1:1 but in Ga-rich or As-rich GaAs it could respectively be Ga\({}_{1,1}\) As\({}_{0,9}\) or Ga\({}_{0,9}\) As\({}_{1,1}\). In general, the presence of defects control the properties of semiconductors in many ways.

## 11 Exercises

2. Electrons are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the dopants.
3. Holes are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the dopants.
4. Holes are majority carriers and trivalent atoms are the dopants.

Apply mirror equation and the condition:

2. \(f\) > 0; \(u\) < 0
3. \(f\) > 0 (convex mirror) and \(u\) < 0
4. \(f\) < 0 (concave mirror); \(f\) < \(u\) < 0

to deduce the desired result.

The pin appears raised by 5.0 cm. It can be seen with an explicit ray diagram that the answer is independent of the location of the slab (for small angles of incidence).

1. \(\sin\,i^{\prime}_{\rm c}\)= 1.44/1.68 which gives \(i^{\prime}_{\rm c}\) = 59\({}^{\circ}\). Total internal reflection takes place when \(i\) > 59\({}^{\circ}\) or when \(r\) < \(r_{\rm max}\) = 31\({}^{\circ}\). Now, \(\{\sin i^{\prime}_{\rm max}/\sin r_{\rm max}\}\)= 1.68, which gives \(i_{\rm max}\)\(\simeq\) 60\({}^{\circ}\). Thus, all incident rays of angles in the range 0 < \(i\) < 60\({}^{\circ}\) will suffer total internal reflections in the pipe. (If the length of the pipe is finite, which it is in practice, there will be a lower limit on \(i\) determined by the ratio of the diameter to the length of the pipe.)
2. If there is no outer coating, \(i^{\prime}_{\rm c}\) = \(\sin^{-1}(1/1.68)\) = 36.5\({}^{\circ}\). Now, \(i\) = 90\({}^{\circ}\) will have \(r\) = 36.5\({}^{\circ}\) and \(i^{\prime}\) = 53.5\({}^{\circ}\) which is greater than \(i^{\prime}_{\rm c}\). Thus, _all_ incident rays (in the range 53.5\({}^{\circ}\) < \(i\) < 90\({}^{\circ}\)) will suffer total internal reflections.

For fixed distance s between object and screen, the lens equation does not give a real solution for \(u\) or \(v\) if \(f\) is greater than s/4. Therefore, \(f_{\rm max}\) = 0.75 m.

1. \(f_{\rm max}\) = 0.75 m.
2. 1. 4 cm
3. 1. Let a parallel beam be the incident from the left on the convex lens first. \(f_{\rm i}\) = 30 cm and \(u_{\rm i}\) = \(\infty\), give \(v_{\rm i}\) = + 30 cm. This image becomes a virtual object for the second lens. \(f_{\rm 2}\) = -20 cm, \(u_{\rm 2}\) = + (30, - 8) cm = + 22 cm which gives, \(v_{\rm i}\) = - 220 cm. The parallel incident beam appears to diverge from a point 216 cm from the centre of the two-lens system.
4. Let the parallel beam be incident from the left on the concave lens first: \(f_{\rm i}\) = -20 cm, \(u_{\rm i}\) = - \(\infty\), give \(v_{\rm i}\) = - 20 cm. This image becomes a real object for the second lens: \(f_{\rm 2}\) = + 30 cm, \(u_{\rm 2}\) = - (20 + 8) cm = -28 cm which gives, \(v_{\rm i}\) = - 420 cm. The parallel incident beam appears to diverge from a point 416 cm on the left of the centre of the two-lens system.

Clearly, the answer depends on which side of the lens system the parallel beam is incident. _Further we do not have a simple lens equation true for all \(u\) (and \(v\)) in terms of a definite constant of the system (the constant being determined by\(f_{\rm i}\) and\(f_{\rm 2}\), and the separation between the lenses)_. The notion of effective focal length, therefore, does not seem to be meaningful for this system.

1. \(u_{\rm i}\) = - 40 cm, \(f_{\rm i}\) = 30 cm, gives \(v_{\rm i}\)= 120 cm.

Magnitude of magnification due to the first (convex) lens is 3. \(u_{\rm 2}\) = + (120 - 8) cm = +112 cm (object virtual);

\[f_{\rm 2}\) = - 20 cm which gives \(v_{\rm i}\) = - \(\frac{112\times 20}{92}\) cm

Magnitude of magnification due to the second (concave)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:822]

effect is negligible if the image is at a very large distance away. [_Note:_ When the eye is separated from the lens, the angles subtended at the eye by the first object and its image are not equal.]
3. First, grinding lens of very small focal length is not easy. More important, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical and chromatic) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you cannot get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple convex lens. However, using an aberration corrected lens system, one can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.
4. Angular magnification of eye-piece is \(|(25/f_{e})+1|(f_{e}\text{ in cm})\) which increases if \(f_{e}\) is smaller. Further, magnification of the objective is given by \(\dfrac{v_{\text{o}}}{|u_{\text{o}}|}=\dfrac{1}{(|u_{\text{o}}|/f_{\text{o}})-1}\) which is large when \(|u_{\text{o}}|\) is slightly greater than \(f_{\text{o}}\). The microscope is used for viewing very close object. So \(|u_{\text{o}}|\) is small, and so is \(f_{\text{o}}\).
5. The image of the objective in the eye-piece is known as 'eyering'. All the rays from the object refracted by objective go through the eye-ring. Therefore, it is an ideal position for our eyes for viewing. If we place our eyes too close to the eye-piece, we shall not,collect much of the light and also reduce our field of view: If we position our eyes on the eye-ring and the area of the pupil of our eye is greater or equal to the area of the eye-ring, our eyes will collect all the light refracted by the objective. The precise location of the eye-ring naturally depends on the separation between the objective and the eye-piece. When you view through a microscope by placing your eyes on one end, the ideal distance between the eyes and eye-piece is usually built-in the design of the instrument.

Assume microscope in normal use i.e., image at 25 cm. Angular magnification of the eye-piece

= \(\dfrac{25}{5}+1=6\) Magnification of the objective

= \(\dfrac{30}{6}=5\)

. \(\dfrac{1}{5u_{\text{o}}}-\dfrac{1}{u_{\text{o}}}=1.25\) which gives \(u_{\text{o}}\)= -1.5 cm; \(v_{\text{o}}\)= 7.5 cm. \(|u_{e}|\)= (25/6) cm = 4.17 cm. The separation between the objective and the eye-piece should be (7.5 + 4.17) cm = 11.67 cm. Further the object should be placed 1.5 cm from the objective to obtain the desired magnification.

1. \(m=(f_{\text{o}}/f_{e})=28\)
2. \(m=\dfrac{f_{\text{o}}}{f_{e}}\Big{[}1+\dfrac{f_{\text{o}}}{25}\Big{]}=33.6\)* 9.28 (a) \(f_{\rm o}+f_{\rm e}\) = 145 cm
* (b) Angle subtended by the tower = (100/3000) = (1/30) rad. Angle subtended by the image produced by the objective = \(\frac{h}{f_{\rm o}}=\frac{h}{140}\)

Equating the two, \(h\) = 4.7 cm.
* (c) Magnification (magnitude) of the eye-piece = 6. Height of the final image (magnitude) = 28 cm.
* 9.29 The image formed by the larger (concave) mirror acts as virtual object for the smaller (convex) mirror. Parallel rays coming from the object at infinity will focus at a distance of 110 mm from the larger mirror. The distance of virtual object for the smaller mirror = (110)-20) = 90 mm. The focal length of smaller mirror is 70 mm. Using the mirror formula, image is formed at 315 mm from the smaller mirror.
* 9.30 The reflected rays get deflected by twice the angle of rotation of the mirror. Therefore, \(d/1.5\)-\(\tau\) tan 7\({}^{\circ}\). Hence \(d\) = 18.4 cm.

12.2The nucleus of a hydrogen atom is-a proton. The mass of it is \(1.67\times 10^{-27}\) kg, whereas the mass of an incident \(a\)-particle is \(6.64\times 10^{27}\) kg. Because the scattering particle is more massive than the target nuclei (proton), the \(\bar{a}\)-particle won't bounce back in even in a head-on collision. It is similar to a football colliding with a tenis ball at rest. Thus, there would be no large-angle scattering.
