UNIT 1 SOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY

_Chemistry is the science of molecules and their transformations. It is the science not so much of the one hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that may be built from them?_

_Roadd Hoffmann_

Chemistry deals with the composition, structure and properties of matter. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter: atoms and molecules. That is why chemistry is called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and number of these particles (atoms and molecules)? We will like to answer some of these questions in this Unit. We would further describe how physical properties of matter can be quantitatively described using numerical values with suitable units.

### Importance of Chemistry

Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to systematize knowledge for describing and understanding nature. For the sake of convenience science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology etc. Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition, properties and interaction of matter. Chemists are interested in knowing how chemical transformations occur. Chemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science like physics, biology, geology etc. Chemistry also plays an important role in daily life.

Chemical principles are important in diverse areas, such as: weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer. Chemical industries manufacturing fertilizers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys and other inorganic and organic chemicals, including new materials, contribute in a big way to the national economy.

Chemistry plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, health care products and other materials aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large scale production of a variety of fertilizers, improved varieties of pesticides and insecticides. Similarly many life saving drugs such as eslighten and taxol, are effective in cancer therapy and AZT (Azidothymidine) used for helping AIDS victims. have been isolated from plant and animal sources or prepared by synthetic methods.

With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesize new materials having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres and large scale miniaturization of solid state devices. In recent years chemistry has tackled with a fair degree of success some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases like methane, carbon dioxide etc. Understanding of bio-chemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic materials are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country like India needs talented and creatwe chemists for accepting such challenges.

### Nature of Matter

You are already familiar with the term **matter** from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called **matter**. Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings etc. are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space.

You are also aware that matter can exist in three physical states _viz._**solid. liquid** and **gas**. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1. In **solids**. these particles are held very close to each other in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In **liquids**. the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in **gases**. the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics:

1. Solids have _definite volume_ and _definite shape_.
2. Liquids have _definite volume_ but _not_ the _definite shape_. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.
3. Gases have _neither definite volume nor definite shape_. They completely occupy the container in which they are placed. These threestates of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure.

On heating a solid usually changes to a liquid and the liquid on further heating

Figure 1.1: Arrangement of particles in solid. liquid and gaseous state

changes to the gaseous ( or vapour) state. In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.

At the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as mixtures or pure substances. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 2.

Many of the substances present around you are mixtures. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea etc., are all mixtures. A mixture contains two or more substances present in it (in any ratio) which are called its components. A mixture may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a homogeneous mixture, the components completely mix with each other and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution, and air are thus, the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in heterogeneous mixtures, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes the different components can be observed. For example, the mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone) pieces, are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated using physical methods such as simple hand picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation etc.

_Pure substances_ have characteristics different from the mixtures. They have fixed composition, whereas mixtures may contain the components in any ratio and their composition is variable. Copper, silver, gold, water, glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and thus, like all other pure substances has a fixed composition. Also, the constituents of pure substances cannot be separated by simple physical methods.

_Pure substances_ can be further classified into elements and compounds. An element consists of only one type of particles. These particles may beatoms or molecules. You may be familiar with atoms and molecules from the previous classes: however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen etc. are some examples of elements. They all contain atoms of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements such as sodium or copper, contain single atoms held together as their constituent particles whereas in some others, two or more atoms combine to give molecules of the element. Thus, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.

When two or more atoms of different elements combine, the molecule of a compound is obtained. The examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon

Figure 3: A representation of atoms and molecules

Figure 2: Classification of matter

dioxide, sugar etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig 4.

You have seen above that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases whereas the compound formed by their combination _i.e._, water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.

Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods.

### Properties of Matter and Their Measurement

Every substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories -**physical properties** and **chemical properties**.

**Physical properties** are those properties which can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the sub stance. Some examples of physical properties are colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density etc. The measurement or observation of **chemical properties** require a chemical change to occur. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility etc.

Many properties of matter such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example length of a room can be represented as 6 m: here 6 is the number and m denotes _metre_ -the unit in which the length is measured.

Two different systems of measurement, i.e. the **English System** and the **Metric System** were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. The need of a common standard system was being felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed below in detail.

#### The International System of Units (SI)

The International System of Units (in French _Le Systeme International d'Unites_ - abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM from _Conference Generale des Poids at Measures_). The CGPM is an inter governmental treaty organization created by a diplomatic treaty known as Meter Convention which was signed in Paris in 1875.

The SI system has seven _base units_ and they are listed in Table 1. These units pertain to the seven fundamental scientific quantities. The other physical quantities such as speed, volume, density etc. can be derived from these quantities.

The definitions of the SI base units are given in Table 2.

The SI system allows the use of prefixes to indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit. These prefixes are listed in Table 3.

Let us now quickly go through some of the quantities which you will be often using in this book.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

A common unit, litre (L) which is not an SI unit, is used for measurement of volume of liquids.

1 L = 1000 mL, 1000 cm\({}^{3}\) = 1 dm\({}^{3}\)

Fig. 1.6 helps to visualise these relations.

In the laboratory, volume of liquids or solutions can be measured by graduated cylinder, burette, pipette etc. A volumetric flask is used to prepare a known volume of a solution. These measuring devices are shown in Fig. 1.7.

_Density_

Density of a substance is its amount of mass per unit volume. So SI units of density can be obtained as follows:

\[\text{SI unit of density}=\frac{\cdot\text{ SI unit of m}}{\text{ SI unit of vo}}\]

This unit is quite large and a chemist often expresses density in g cm\({}^{3}\), where mass is expressed in gram and volume is expressed in cm\({}^{3}\).

_Temperature_

There are three common scales to measure temperature -- C (degree celsius), F (degree fahreneti) and K (kevin). Here, K is the SI unit. The thermometers based on these scales are shown in Fig. 1.8. Generally, the thermometer with celsius scale are calibrated from 0 to 100 where these two temperatures are the freezing point and the boiling point of water respectively. The fahreneti scale is represented between 32 to 212.

The temperatures on two scales are related to each other by the following relation ship:

\[{}^{\circ}\text{F}=\frac{9}{5}(^{\circ}\text{C})+3\]

The kelvin scale is related to celsius scale as follows :

\[\text{K}={}^{\circ}\text{C}+273.1\]

Fig. 1.6: Different unit’s used to express volume

Fig. 1.7: Some volume measuring devicesIt is interesting to note that temperature below 0 C (i.e. negative values) are possible in Celsius scale but in Kelvin scale, negative temperature is not possible.

**Reference Standard**

After defining a unit of measurement such as the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed on reference standards that make it possible to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting reliable measurements, all devices such as _metre sticks_ and _analytical balances_ have been calibrated by their manufacturers to give correct readings. However, each of these devices is standardised or calibrated against some reference. The mass standard is the kilogram since 188g. It has been defined as the mass of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) cylinder that is stored in an airtightjar at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres. France. Pt-Ir was chosen for this standard because it is highly resistant to chemical attack and its mass will not change for an extremely long time.

**Scientists are in search of a new standard for mass. This is being attempted through accurate determination of Avogadro constant. Work on this new standard focuses on ways to measure accurately the number of atoms in a well-defined mass of sample. One such method, which uses X-rays to determine the atomic density of a crystal of ultrapure silicon. has an accuracy of about 1 part in 10\({}^{\circ}\) but has not yet been adopted to serve as a standard. There are other methods but none of them are presently adequate to replace the Pt-Ir cylinder. No doubt. changes are expected within this decade.

The metre was originally defined as the length between two marks on a Pt-Ir bar kept at a temperature of 0 C (273.15 K). In 1960 the length of the metre was defined as 1.65076373 10\({}^{\circ}\)times the wavelength of light emitted by a krypton laser. Although this was a cumbersome number, it preserved the length of the metre at its agreed value. The metre was redefined in 1983 by CGPM as the length of path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. Similar to the length and the mass, there are reference standards for other physical quantities.

### Uncertainty in Measurement

Many a times in the study of chemistry, one has to deal with experimental data as well as theoretical calculations. There are meaningful ways to handle the numbers conveniently and present the data realistically with certainty to the extent possible. These ideas are discussed below in detail.

#### 1.4.1 Scientific Notation

As chemistry is the study of atoms and molecules which have extremely low masses and are present in extremely large numbers, a chemist has to deal with numbers as large as 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as small as 0.0000000000000000000000166 g mass of a H atom. Similarly other constants such as Planck's constant, speed of light, charges on particles etc., involve numbers of the above magnitude.

It may look funny for a moment to write or count numbers involving so many zeros but it offers a real challenge to sample mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division with such numbers. You can write any two numbers of the above type and try any one of the operations you like to accept the challenge and then you will really appreciate the difficulty in handling such numbers.

This problem is solved by using scientific notation for such numbers, _i.e._, exponential notation in which any number can be represented in the form N 10\({}^{n}\) where n is an exponent having positive or negative values and N can vary between 1 to 10.

Thus, we can write 232.508 as 2.32508 \(\times 10^{\alpha}\) in scientific notation. Note that while writing it, the decimal had to be moved to the _left_ by two places and same is the exponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation.

Similarly, 0.000016 can be written as 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\alpha}\). Here the decimal has to be moved four places to the _right_ and (\(-4\)) is the exponent in the scientific notation.

Now, for performing mathematical operations on numbers expressed in scientific 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

significant. Thus, 2.005 has four significant figures.
4. Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant provided they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example, 0.200 g has three significant figures. But, if otherwise, the zeros are not significant. For example, 100 has only one significant figure.
5. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures. For example, in 2 balls or 20 eggs, there are infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and can be represented by writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000 When numbers are written in scientific notation, the number of digits between 1 and 10 gives the number of significant figures. Thus, 4.01 102 has three significant figures, and 8.256 10 3 has four significant figures.

_Addition and Subtraction of Significant Figures_

The result cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than either of the original numbers.

\[\begin{array}{c}12.11\\ 18.0\\ 1.012\\ \hline 31.122\\ \end{array}\]

Here, 18.0 has only one digit after the decimal point and the result should be reported only up to one digit after the decimal point which is 31.1.

_Multiplication and Division of Significant Figures_

In these operations, the result must be reported with no more significant figures as are there in the measurement with the few significant figures.

\[\begin{array}{c}2.5\ 1.25=3.125\\ \end{array}\]

Since 2.5 has two significant figures, the result should not have more than two significant figures, thus, it is 3.1.

While limiting the result to the required number of significant figures as done in the above mathematical operation, one has to keep in mind the following points for rounding off the numbers

1. If the rightmost digit to be removed is more than 5, the preceding number is increased by one. for example 1.386 If we have to remove 6, we have to round it to 1.39
2. If the rightmost digit to be removed is less than 5, the preceding number is not changed. For example, 4.334 if 4 is to be removed, then the result is rounded upto 4.33.
3. If the rightmost digit to be removed is 5, then the preceding number is not changed if it is an even number but it is increased by one if it is an odd number. For example, if 6.35 is to be rounded by removing 5, we have to increase 3 to 4 giving 6.4 as the result. However, if 6.25 is to be rounded off it is rounded off to 6.2.

#### 1.4.3 Dimensional Analysis

Often while calculating, there is a need to convert units from one system to other. The method used to accomplish this is called **factor label method** or **unit factor method** or **dimensional analysis**. This is illustrated below.

**Example**

A piece of metal is 3 inch (represented by m) long. What is its length in cm?

We know that 1 in = 2.54 cm

From this equivalence, we can write

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \frac{1\,\mathrm{in}}{2.54\,\mathrm{cm}}=1=\\ \cdot\\ \cdot\\ \mathrm{thus}\end{array}\]

equals 1. Both of these are called **unit factors**. If some number is multiplied by these unit factors (i.e. 1), it will not be affected otherwise.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

Thus, irrespective of the source, a given compound always contains same elements in the same proportion. The validity of this law has been confirmed by various experiments. It is sometimes also referred to as **Law of definite composition**.

#### 1.5.3 Law of Multiple Proportions

This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803. According to this law. _if two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element, are in the ratio of small whole numbers._

For example, hydrogen combines with oxygen to form two compounds, namely, water and hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrogen + Oxygen \(\rightarrow\) Water

2g 16g 18g

Hydrogen + Oxygen \(\rightarrow\) Hydrogen Peroxide

2g 32g 34g

Here, the masses of oxygen (i.e. 16 g and 32 g) which combine with a fixed mass of hydrogen (2g) bear a simple ratio, i.e. 16:32 or 1: 2.

#### 1.5.4 Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes

This law was given by Gay Lussac in 1808. He observed that _when gases combine or are produced in a chemical reaction they do so in a simple ratio by volume provided all gases are at same temperature and pressure_.

Thus, 100 mL of hydrogen combine with 50 mL of oxygen to give 100 mL of water vapour,

Hydrogen + Oxygen \(\rightarrow\) Water

100 mL 50 mL 100 mL

Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combine together (i.e. 100 mL and 50 mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1.

Gay-Lussac's discovery of in tiger ratio in volume relationship is actually the law of definite proportions by volume. The law of definite proportions, stated earlier, was with respect to mass. The Gay-Lussac's law was explained properly by the work of Avogadro in 1811.

#### 1.5.5 Avogadro Law

In 1811, Avogadro proposed that _equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure should contain equal number of molecules_. Avogadro made a distinction between atoms and molecules which is quite understandable in the present times. If we consider again the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, we see that two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water without leaving any unreacted oxygen.

Note that in the Fig. 1.9, each box contains equal number of molecules. In fact, Avogadro could explain the above result by considering the molecules to be **polyatomic**. If hydrogen

Figure 1.9: Two volumes of hydrogen read with One volume of oxygen to give Two volumes of water vapour

and oxygen were considered as **diatomic** as recognised now, then the above results are easily understandable. However, Dalton and others believed at that time that atoms of the same kind cannot combine and molecules of oxygen or hydrogen containing two atoms did not exist, Avogadro's proposal was published in the French **Journal de Physique**. In spite of being correct, it did not gain much support.

After about 50 years, in 1860, first international conference on chemistry was held in Karlsruhe, Germany to resolve various ideas. At the meeting, Stanis lao Cannizaro presented a sketch of a course of chemical philosophy which emphasised the importance of Avogadro's work.

### Dalton's Atomic Theory

Although the origin of idea that matter is composed of small indivisible particles called _'a tomio'_ (meaning -- _indivisible_), dates back to the time of Democritus, a Greek Philosopher (460 -- 370 BC), it again started emerging as a result of several experimental studies which led to the Laws mentioned above.

In 1808, Dalton published 'A New System of Chemical Philosophy' in which he proposed the following :

1. Matter consists of indivisible atoms.
2. All the atoms of a given element have identical properties including identical mass, Atoms of different elements differ in mass.
3. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio.
4. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation of atoms. These are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Dalton's theory could explain the laws of chemical combination.

### Atomic and Molecular Masses

After having some idea about the terms atoms and molecules, it is appropriate here to understand what we mean by atomic and molecular masses.

#### Atomic Mass

The atomic mass or the mass of an atom is actually very-very small because atoms are extremely small. Today, we have sophisticated techniques _e.g._. mass spectrometry for determining the atomic masses fairly accurately. But, in the nineteenth century, scientists could determine mass of one atom **relative** to another by experimental means, as has been mentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being lightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass of 1 (without any units) and other elements were assigned masses relative to it. However, the present system of atomic masses is based on carbon - 12 as the standard and has been agreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon - 12 is one of the _isotopes_ of carbon and can be represented as \({}^{12}\)C. In this system, \({}^{12}\)C is assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass unit (**amu**) and masses of all other atoms are given relative to this standard. One **atomic mass unit** is defined as a mass exactly equal to one-twelfth the mass of one carbon - 12 atom.

And 1 amu = 1.66056 10\({}^{-24}\) g

Mass of an atom of hydrogen

= 1.6736 10\({}^{-24}\) g

Thus, in terms of amu, the mass

\[\cdot\]

of hydrogen atom = 

Similarly, the mass of oxygen - 16 (\({}^{16}\)O) atom would be 15.995 amu.

Today, **amu** has been replaced by '**u'** which is known as **unified mass**.

When we use atomic masses of elements in calculations, we actually use _average atomic masses_ of elements which are explained below.

#### Average Atomic Mass

Many naturally occurring elements exist as more than one isotope. When we take into account the existence of these isotopes and their relative abundance(per cent occurrence),the average atomic mass of that element can be computed. For example, carbon has the following three isotopes with relative abundances and masses as shown against each of them.

From the above data, the average atomic mass of carbon will come out to be :

(0.98892) (12 u) + { 0.01108} (13.00335 u) + (2 10\({}^{-12}\)) (14.00317 u)

= 12.011 u

Similarly, average atomic masses for other elements can be calculated. In the periodic table of elements, the atomic masses mentioned for different elements actually represented their average atomic masses.

1.7.3 Molecular Mass

Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of the elements present in a molecule. It is obtained by multiplying the atomic mass of each element by the number of its atoms and adding them together. For example, molecular mass of methane which contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms can be obtained as follows :

Molecular mass of methane,

(CH\({}_{4}\)) = (12.011 u) + 4 (1.008 u)

= 16.043 u

Similarly, molecular mass of water (H\({}_{2}\)O)

= 2 atomic mass of hydrogen + 1 atomic mass of oxygen

= 2 (1.008 u) + 16.00 u

= 18.02 u

**Problem 1.1**

Calculate molecular mass of glucose (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)) molecule.

**Solution**

Molecular mass of glucose (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\))

= 6(12.011 u) + 12(1.008 u) + 6(16.00 u)

= (72.066 u) + (12.096 u) + (96.00 u)

= 180.162 u

#### 1.7.4 Formula Mass

Some substances such as sodium chloride do not contain discrete molecules as their constituent units. In such compounds, positive (sodium) and negative (chloride) entities are arranged in a three-dimensional structure, as shown in Fig. 10.

It may be noted that in sodium chloride, one Na\({}^{*}\) is surrounded by six Cl and _vice versa_.

The formula such as NaCl is used to calculate the **formula mass** instead of molecular mass as in the solid state sodium chloride does not exist as a single entity.

Thus, formula mass of sodium chloride = atomic mass of sodium + atomic mass of chlorine

= 23.0 u + 35.5 u = 58.5 u

Figure 10: Packing of Na\({}^{*}\) and Cl\({}^{*}\) ions in sodium chloride

### 1.8 Mole Concept and Molar Masses

Atoms and molecules are extremely small in size and their numbers in even a small amount of any substance is really very large. To handle such large numbers, a unit of similar magnitude is required.

Just as we denote one dozen for 12 items, score for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we use the idea of mole to count entities at the microscopic level (i.e. atoms/molecules/particles, electrons, ions, etc).

In SI system, **mole** (symbol, mol) was introduced as seventh base quantity for the amount of a substance.

**One mole is the amount of a substance that contains as many particles or entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 g (or 0.012 kg) of the 12C isotope.** It may be emphasised that the mole of a substance always contain the same number of entities, no matter what the substance may be. In order to determine this number precisely, the mass of a carbon-12 atom was determined by a mass spectrometer and found to be equal to 1.992648 10\({}^{23}\) g. Knowing that one mole of carbon weighs 12 g, the number of atoms in it is equal to :

\(\cdot\)\(12\,g/1\)

\(1.992648\times 1\)C

\(\cdot\)\(=6.0221367\)

This number of entities in 1 mol is so important that it is given a separate name and symbol, known as 'Avogadro' constant, denoted by (N\({}_{\text{a}}\)) in honour of Amedoe Avogadro. To really appreciate largeness of this number, let us write it with all the zeroes without using any powers of ten.

602213670000000000000000

Hence, so many entities [atoms, molecules or any other particle] constitute one mole of a particular substance.

We can, therefore, say that 1 mol of hydrogen atoms = 6.022 10\({}^{23}\) atoms

1 mol of water molecules = 6.022 10\({}^{23}\) water molecules

1 mol of sodium chloride = 6.022 10\({}^{23}\) formula units of sodium chloride

Having defined the mole, it is easier to know mass of one mole of the substance or the constituent entities. **The mass of one mole of a substance in grams is called its molar mass.** The molar mass in grams is numerically equal to atomic/molecular/formula mass in u.

Molar mass of water = 18.02 g

Molar mass of sodium chloride = 58.5 g

### 1.9 Percentage Composition

So far, we were dealing with the number of entities present in a given sample. But many a time, the information regarding the percentage of a particular element present in a compound is required. Suppose an unknown or new compound is given to you, the first question you would ask is: what is its formula or what are its constituents and in what ratio are they present in the given compound? For known compounds also, such information provides a check whether the given sample contains the same percentage of elements as is present in a pure sample. In other words, one can check the purity of a given sample by analysing this is data.

Let us understand it by taking the example of water (H\({}_{2}\)O). Since water contains hydrogen and oxygen, the percentage composition of both these elements can be calculated as follows :

Mass % of an element =

mass of that e molar

### 1.10 STOICHOMETRY AND

STOICHOMETRIC CALCULATIONS

The word'stoichiometry' is derived from two Greek words - _stoicheion_ (meaning _element_) and _metron_ (meaning _measure_). Stoichiometry, thus, deals with the calculation of masses (sometimes volumes also) of the reactants and the products involved in a chemical reaction. Before understanding how to calculate the amounts of reactants required or those produced in a chemical reaction, let us study what information is available from the _balanced_ chemical equation of a given reaction. Let us consider the combustion of methane. A balanced equation for this reaction is as given below :

\[\text{CH}_{4}\left(\text{g}\right)+2\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\to \text{CO}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{g}\right)\]

**Balancing a chemical equation**

According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the _same number of atoms of each element on both sides_ of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by _trial and error_. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides

\(4\text{Fe}[\text{s}]+3\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to 2\text{Fe}_{2}\text{O}_{3}[ \text{s}]\) (a) balanced equation

\(2\text{Mg}[\text{s}]+\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to 2\text{Mg}[\text{s}]\) (b) balanced equation

\(\text{P}_{4}[\text{s}]+\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to\text{P}_{0}[\text{s}]\) (c) unbalanced equation

Equations (a) and (b) are balanced since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on each side of equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the right side of the equation.

\(\text{P}_{4}[\text{s}]+5\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to\text{P}_{0}[\text{s}]\)balanced equation

Now let us take combustion of propane, \(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}\). This equation can be balanced in steps.

**Step 1** Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here propane and oxygen are reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.

\(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}[\text{g}]+\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to\text{CO}_{2}[ \text{g}]+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}[\text{l}]\) unbalanced equation

**Step 2**_Balance the number of C atoms_: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three C\({}_{2}\) molecules are required on the right side.

\(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}[\text{g}]+\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to 3\text{CO}_{2}[ \text{g}]+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{l}\right)\)

**Step 3**_Balance the number of H atoms_ : on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.

\(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}[\text{g}]+\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to 3\text{CO}_{2}[ \text{g}]+4\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{l}\right)\)

**Step 4**_Balance the number of O atoms_: There are ten oxygen atoms on the right side (\(3\times 2=6\) in CO\({}_{2}\) and \(4\times 1=4\) in water). Therefore, five O\({}_{2}\) molecules are needed to supply the required ten oxygen atoms.

\(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}[\text{g}]+5\text{O}_{2}[\text{g}]\to 3\text{CO}_{2}[ \text{g}]+4\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{l}\right)\)

**Step 5**_Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation_. The equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and ten oxygen atoms on each side. All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance an equation.

Here, methane and dioxygen are called _reactants_ and carbon dioxide and water are called _products_. Note that all the reactants and the products are gases in the above reaction and this has been indicated by letter (g) in the brackets next to its formula. Similarly, in the case of solids and liquids, (s) and (l) are written respectively.

The coefficients 2 for O2 and H2O are called stoichiometric coefficients. Similarly the coefficient for CH4 and CO2 is one in each case. They represent the number of molecules (and moles as well) taking part in the reaction or formed in the reaction.

Thus, according to the above chemical reaction,

One **mole** of CH4(g) reacts with two **moles** of O2(g) to give one **mole** of CO2(g) and two **moles** of H2O(g)

One **molecule** of CH4(g) reacts with 2 **molecules** of O2(g) to give one **mlecule** of CO2(g) and 2 molecules of H2O(g)

22.4 L of CH4(g) reacts with 44.8 L of O2(g) to give 22.4 L of CO2(g) and 44.8 L of H2O(g)

16 g of CH4(g) reacts with 2 32 g of O2(g) to give 44 g of CO2(g) and 2 18 g of H2O(g).

From these relationships, the given data can be interconverted as follows :

mass \(f\) mole

Mass Volume = Den

**Problem 1.3**

Calculate the amount of water (g) produced by the combustion of 16 g of methane.

**Solution**

The balanced equation for combustion of methane is :

CH4(g)+2O2

(g)16 g of CH4 corresponds to one mole.

**(ii)** From the above equation, 1 mol of CH4(g) gives 2 mol of H2O(g).

**2** mol of water (H2O) = 2 18 g = 36 g

1 mol H2O = 18 g H2O = 18 g H2O

**Problem 1.4**

How many moles of methane are required to produce 22 g CO2(g) after combustion?

**Solution**

According to the chemical equation,

CH4(g)+2O2

44 g CO2(g) is obtained from 16 g CH4(g).

[ Q 1 mol CO2(g) is obtained from 1 mol of CH4(g)]

mode of CO2(g)

= 22 g CO2(g) 1 mol CO2(g)

= 0.5 mol CO2(g)

Hence, 0.5 mol CO2(g) would be obtained from 0.5 mol CH4(g) or 0.5 mol of CH4(g) would be required to produce 22 g CO2(g).

1.10.1 Limiting Reagent

Many a time, the reactions are carried out when the reactants are not present in the amounts as required by a balanced chemical reaction. In such situations, one reactant is in excess over the other. The reactant which is present in the lesser amount gets consumed after sometime and after that no further reaction takes place whatever be the amount of the other reactant present. Hence, the reactant which gets consumed, limits the amount of product formed and is, therefore, called the **limiting reagent**.

In performing stoichiometric calculations, this aspect is also to be kept in mind.

**Problem 1.5**

50.0 kg of N\({}_{2}\) (g) and 10.0 kg of H\({}_{2}\) (g) are mixed to produce NH\({}_{3}\) (g). Calculate the NH\({}_{3}\) (g) formed. Identify the limiting reagent in the production of NH\({}_{3}\) in th s situation.

**Solution**

A balanced equation for the above reaction is written as follows :

Calculation of moles :

N\({}_{2}\) (g) + 3H\({}_{2}\) (t

moles of N\({}_{2}\)

= 50.0 kg N\({}_{2}\)\(\frac{1000\) g N\({}_{2}}{1\) kg N\({}_{2}}\).

= 17.86 102 mol

moles of H\({}_{2}\)

= 10.00 kg H\({}_{2}\)\(\frac{1000\) g H\({}_{2}}{1\) kg H\({}_{2}}\)\(\frac{2}{2}\)

= 4.96 103 mol

According to the above equation, 1 mol N\({}_{2}\) (g) requires 3 mol H\({}_{2}\) (g), for the reaction. Hence, for 17.86 102 mol of N\({}_{2}\), the moles of H\({}_{2}\) (g) required would be

17.86 102 mol N\({}_{2}\)\(\frac{3\) mol H\({}_{2}\)(g)

= 5.36 103 mol H\({}_{2}\)

But we have only 4.96 103 mol H\({}_{2}\). Hence, dihydrogen is the limiting reagent in th s case. So NH\({}_{3}\)(g) would be formed only from that amount of available dhy drogen _i.e._, 4.96 103 mol

Since 3 mol H\({}_{2}\)(g) gives 2 mol NH\({}_{3}\)(g)

= 3.30 103 mol NH\({}_{3}\) (g)

= 3.30 103 mol NH\({}_{3}\) (g) is obtained.

If they are to be converted to grams, it is done as follows :

1 mol NH\({}_{3}\) (g) = 17.0 g NH\({}_{3}\) (g)

17.0 g NH\({}_{3}\) (g)

= 56.1 102 g NH\({}_{3}\)

= 56.1 kg NH\({}_{3}\)

#### 1.10.2 Reactions in Solutions

A majority of reactions in the laboratories are carried out in solutions. Therefore, it is important to understand as how the amount of substance is expressed when it is present in the form of a solution. The concentration of a solution or the amount of substance present in its given volume can be expressed in any of the following ways.

1. Mass per cent or weight per cent (w/w %)
2. Mole fraction
3. Molarity
4. Molality

Let us now study each one of them in detail.

1. _Mass per cent_

It is obtained by using the following relation:

Massper cen

**Problem 1.6**

A solution is prepared by adding 2 g of a substance A to 18 g of water. Calculate the mass per cent of the solute.

**Solution**

Mass per cent

= \(\frac{2\) g of A+18

= \(\frac{2\) g}{20 g}\(\times 100\)

= 10 %

## Summary

The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes undergone by them. All substances contain matter which can exist in three states - solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An **element** contains particles of only one type which may be **atoms** or **molecules**. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures.

When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist out of which the English and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world which is abbreviated as SI units (International System of Units).

Since measurements involve recording of data which are always associated with a certain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide range of 10\({}^{-31}\) to 10\({}^{-23}\). Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in **scientific notation** is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of **significant figures** in which the observations are reported. The **dimensional analysis** helps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert the results from one system of units to another.

The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination - these being the **Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Properties, Law of Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes** and **Avogadro Law**. All these laws led to the **Dalton's atomic theory** which states that atoms are building blocks of matter. The **atomic mass** of an element is expressed relative to \({}^{12}\)C isotope of carbon which has an exact value of 12. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element isthe average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound and its molecular mass.

The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are expressed in the terms of Avogadro constant (6.022 10\({}^{\text{m}}\)). This is known as 1 mol of the respective particles or entities.

Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amounts of one or more reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.

## Chapter 2 Structure of Atom

1 The rich diversity of chemical behaviour of different elements can be traced to the differences in the internal structure of atoms of these elements.

The existence of atoms has been proposed since the time of early Indian and Greek philosophers (400 B.C.) who were of the view that atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. According to them, the continued subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms which would not be further divisible. The word 'atom' has been derived from the Greek word '_a tomio_' which means 'uncutable' or 'non-divisible'. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant for a very long time and were revived again by scientists in the nineteenth century.

The atomic theory of matter was first proposed on a firm scientific basis by John Dalton, a British school teacher in 1808. His theory, called **Dalton's atomic theory**, regarded the atom as the ultimate particle of matter (Unit 1).

In this unit we start with the experimental observations made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and beginning of twentieth century. These established that atoms can be further divided into subatomic particles, i.e., electrons, protons and neutrons--a concept very different from that of Dalton. The major problems before the scientists at that time were:

* to account for the stability of atom after the discovery of sub-atomic particles,
* to compare the behaviour of one element from other in terms of both physical and chemical properties,* to explain the formation of different kinds of molecules by the combination of different atoms and,
* to understand the origin and nature of the characteristics of electromagnetic radiation absorbed or emitted by atoms.

### 2.1 SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES

Dalton's atomic theory was able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of constant composition and law of multiple proportion very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results of many experiments, for example, it was known that substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk or fur generate electricity. Many different kinds of sub-atomic particles were discovered in the twentieth century. However, in this section we will talk about only two particles, namely electron and proton.

#### 2.1.1 Discovery of Electron

In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the electrodes, which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. He formulated certain laws which you will study in class XII. These results suggested the particulate nature of electricity.

An insight into the structure of atom was obtained from the experiments on electrical discharge through gases. Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles : "Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other".

In mid 1850s many scientists mainly Faraday began to study electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, known as **cathode ray discharge tubes**. It is depicted in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of glass containing two thin pieces of metal, called electrodes, sealed in it, The electrical discharge through the gases could be observed only at very low pressures and at very high voltages. The pressure of different gases could be adjusted by evacuation. When sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles moving in the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode). These were called **cathode rays or cathode ray particles**. The flow of current from cathode to anode was further checked by making a hole in the anode and coating the tube behind anode with phosphorescent material zinc sulphide. When these rays, after passing through anode, strike the zinc sulphide coating, a bright spot on the coating is developed(same thing happens in a television set) [Fig. 2.1(b)].

The results of these experiments are summarised below.

1. The cathode rays start from cathode and move towards the anode.
2. Theserays themselves are not visible but their behaviour can be observed with the help of certain kind of materials (fluorescent or phosphorescent) which glow when hit by them. Television picture tubes are cathode raytubes and television pictures result due to fluorescence on the television screen coated with certain fluorescent or phosphorescent materials.

Figure 2.1(b): A cathode ray discharge tube with perforated anode

Figure 2.1: 1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube

3. In the absence of electrical or magnetic field, these rays travel in straight lines (Fig. 2.2).
4. In the presence of electrical or magnetic field, the behaviour of cathode rays are similar to that expected from negatively charged particles, suggesting that the cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, called **electrons.**
5. The characteristics of cathode rays (electrons) do not depend upon the material of electrodes and the nature of the gas present in the cathode ray tube. _Thus, we can conclude that electrons are basic constituent of all the atoms._

#### 2.1.2. Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron

In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson measured the ratio of electrical charge (\(e\)) to the mass of electron (\(m_{e}\)) by using cathode ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic field perpendicular to each other as well as to the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). Thomson argued that the amount of deviation of the particles from their path in the presence of electrical or magnetic field depends upon:

1. the magnitude of the negative charge on the particle, greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with the electric or magnetic field and thus greater is the deflection.
2. the mass of the particle -- lighter the particle, greater the deflection.
3. the strength of the electrical or magnetic field -- the deflection of electrons from its original path increases with the increase in the voltage across the electrodes, or the strength of the magnetic field. When only electric field is applied, the electrons deviate from their path and hit the cathode ray tube at point A. Similarly when only magnetic field is applied, electron strikes the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully balancing the electrical and magnetic field strength, it is possible to bring back the electron to the path followed as in the absence of electric or magnetic field and they hit the screen at point B. By carrying out accurate measurements on the amount of deflections observed by the electrons on the electric field strength or magnetic field strength. Thomson was able to determine the value of \(e/m_{e}\) as: \[\frac{e}{m_{e}}=1.758820\quad 10^{11}\text{ C kg}^{-1}\] (2.1)

Where \(m_{e}\) is the mass of the electron in kg and \(e\) is the magnitude of the change on the electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are negatively charged, the charge on electron is -e.

Figure 2.2: The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electron

2.1.3 Charge on the Electron R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method known as oil drop experiment (1906-14), to determine the charge on the electrons. He found that the charge on the electron to be - 1.6 10\({}^{\circ}\)15 C. The present accepted value of electrical charge is - 1.6022 10\({}^{\circ}\)15 C. The mass of the electron (\(m_{e}\)) was determined by combining these results with Thomson's value of \(e/m_{e}\) ratio..

\[m_{e}=\frac{e}{e/m_{e}}=\.\] \[=9.1094\ 10^{\text{-}31}\,\text{kg} \tag{2.2}\]

2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons Electrical discharge carried out in the modified cathode ray tube led to the discovery of particles carrying positive charge, also known as **canal rays.** The characteristics of these positively charged particles are listed below.

1. unlike cathode rays, the positively charged particles depend upon the nature of gas present in the cathode ray tube. These are simply the positively charged gaseous ions.
2. The charge to mass ratio of the particles is found to depend on the gas from which these originate.
3. Some of the positively charged particles carry a multiple of the fundamental unit of electrical charge.
4. The behaviour of these particles in the magnetic or electrical field is opposite to that observed for electron or cathode rays. The smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called **proton**. This positively charged particle was characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt for the presence of electrically neutral particle as one of the constituent of atom. These particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by \(\alpha\)-particles. When electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of the protons was emitted. He named these particles as **neutrons**. The important properties of the see fundamental particles are given in Table 2.1.

### ATOMIC MODELS

Observations obtained from the experiments mentioned in the previous sections have suggested that Dalton's indivisible atom is composed of sub-atomic particles carrying positive and negative charges. Different

Figure 2.3: The Millikan oil drop apparatus for measuring charge \(e\)’. In chamber the forces acting on oil drop are: gravitational. electrostatic due to electrical field and a viscous drag force when the oil drop is moving.

atomic models were proposed to explain the distributions of these charged particles in an atom. Although some of these models were not able to explain the stability of atoms, two of these models, proposed by J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford are discussed below.

#### Thomson Model of Atom

J. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an atom possesses a spherical shape (radius approximately 10-10 m) in which the positive charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons are embedded into it in such a manner as to give the most stable electrostatic arrangement (Fig. 4). Many different names are given to this model, for example, **plum pudding**, **raisin pudding or watermelon.** This model can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon of positive charge with plums or seeds (electrons) embedded into it. _An important feature of this model is that the mass of the atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the atom._ Although this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but was not consistent with the results of later experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases. In the later half of the nineteenth century different kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhelm Roentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can cause fluorescence in the fluorescent materials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since Roentgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was noticed that X-rays are produced effectively when electrons strike the dense metal anode, called targets. These are not deflected by the electric and magnetic fields and have a very high penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays are used to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths (-0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic character (Section 2.3.1).

Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as radioactivity and the elements known as radioactive elements. This field was developed by Marie Curie, Pierre Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., \(\alpha\), \(\beta\)- and \(\gamma\)-rays are emitted. Rutherford found that \(\alpha\)-rays consists of high energy particles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass. He

**Name** & **Symbol** & **Absolute** & **Relative** & **Mass/kg** & **Mass/u** & **Approx.** \\  & & **charge/C** & **charge** & & & **mass/u** \\ \hline Electron & e & -1.6022\(\times\)10\({}^{-19}\) & -1 & 9.10939\(\times\)10\({}^{-31}\) & 0.00054 & 0 \\ Proton & p & +1.6022\(\times\)10\({}^{-19}\) & +1 & 1.67262\(\times\)10\({}^{-27}\) & 1.00727 & 1 \\ Neutron & n & 0 & 0 & 1.67493\(\times\)10\({}^{-27}\) & 1.00867 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Properties of Fundamental Particlesconcluded that \(\alpha\)- particles are helium nuclei as when \(\alpha\)- particles combined with two electrons yielded helium gas. \(\beta\)-rays are negatively charged particles similar to electrons. The \(\gamma\)-rays are high energy radiations like X-rays, are neutral in nature and do not consist of particles. As regards penetrating power. \(\alpha\)-particles are the least. followed by \(\beta\)-rays (100 times that of \(\alpha\)-particles) and \(\gamma\)-rays (1000 times of that \(\alpha\)-particles).

#### 2.2.2 Rutherford's Nuclear Model of Atom

Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin gold foil with \(\alpha\)-particles. Rutherford's famous \(\alpha\)-particle scattering experiment is represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high energy \(\alpha\)-particles from a radioactive source was directed at a thin foil (thickness - 100 nm) of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it. Whenever \(\alpha\)-particles struck the screen, a tiny flash of light was produced at that point.

The results of scattering experiment were quite unexpected. According to Thomson model of atom, the mass of each gold atom in the foil should have been spread evenly over the entire atom, and \(\alpha\)- particles had enough energy to pass directly through such a uniform distribution of mass. It was expected that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil. It was observed that :

1. most of the \(\alpha\)-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected.
2. a small fraction of the \(\alpha\)-particles was deflected by small angles.
3. a very few \(\alpha\)- particles (-1 in 20,000) bounced back, that is, were deflected by nearly 180. On the basis of the observations. Rutherford drew the following conclusions regarding the structure of atom :

1. Most of the space in the atom is empty as most of the \(\alpha\)-particles passed through the foil undeflected.
2. A few positively charged \(\alpha\)- particles were deflected. The deflection must be due to enormous repulsive force showing that the positive charge of the atom is not spread throughout the atom as Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small volume that repelled and deflected the positively charged \(\alpha\)- particles.
3. Calculations by Rutherford showed that the volume occupied by the nucleus is negligibly small as compared to the total volume of the atom. The radius of the atom is about 10\({}^{-10}\) m. while that of nucleus is 10\({}^{-15}\) m. One can appreciate this difference in size by realising that if a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then the radius of atom would be about 5 km. On the basis of above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atom (after the discovery of protons). According to this model : (i) The positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion of the atom was called **nucleus** by Rutherford. (ii) The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called **orbits**. Thus, Rutherford's model of atom resembles the solar system in which the nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets. (iii) Electrons and the nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction. 2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number The presence of positive charge on the nucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus. As established earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, Z). For example, number of electrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively. **Atomic number (Z) = number of protons in the nucleus of an atom** = number of electrons in a nuertal atom (2.3) While the positive charge of the nucleus is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus, due to protons and neutrons. As discussed earlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as **nucleons**. The total number of nucleons is termed as **mass number (A)** of the atom. **mass number (A) = number of protons (Z) + number of neutrons (n)** (2.4)

#### 2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes

The composition of any atom can be represented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z) on the left hand side as the atomic number (i.e., \(\frac{\Lambda}{2}\) X).

Isobars are the atoms with same mass number but different atomic number for example, \(\frac{14}{6}\)C and \(\frac{14}{7}\)N. On the other hand, atoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as **Isotopes**. In other words (according to equation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called **protium('H)**. Rest of the percentage of hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called **deuterium(\(\frac{2}{1}\)D, 0.015%)** and the other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called **tritium(\(\frac{3}{1}\)T)**. The latter isotope is found in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons (\(\frac{12}{6}\)C, \(\frac{13}{6}\)C, \(\frac{14}{6}\)C); chlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons (\(\frac{35}{17}\)C1, \(\frac{37}{17}\)C1).

Lastly an important point to mention regarding isotopes is that _chemical properties of atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus_. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.

**Problem 2.1**

Calculate the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in \({}^{30}_{35}\)Br.

**Solution**

In this case, \({}^{30}_{35}\)Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species is neutral

Number of protons = number of electrons = Z = 35

Number of neutrons = 80 - 35 = 45, (equation 2.4)

**Problem 2.2**

The number of electrons, protons and neutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16 and 16 respectively. Assign the proper symbol to the species.

**Solution**

Theatomic number is equal to number of protons = 16. The element is sulphur (S).

Atomic mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons

= 16 + 16 = 32

Species is not neutral as the number of protons is not equal to electrons. It is anion (negatively charged) with charge equal to excess electrons = 18 - 16 = 2, Symbol is \({}^{32}_{16}\)S\({}^{2}\).

**Note :** Before using the notation \({}^{\lambda}_{2}\)X, find out whether the species is a neutral atom, a cation or an anion. If it is a neutral atom, equation (2.3) is valid, i.e., number of protons = number of electrons = atomic number. If the species is an ion, determine whether the number of protons are larger (cation, positive ion) or smaller (anion, negative ion) than the number of electrons. Number of neutrons is always given by A-Z, whether the species is neutral or ion.

#### 2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford Model

Rutherford nuclear model of an atom is like a small scale solar system with the nucleus playing the role of the massive sun and the electrons being similar to the lighter planets. Further, the coulomb force (kg\({}_{1}\)q\({}_{2}\)/r\({}^{2}\) where \(q\)\({}_{1}\) and \(q\)\({}_{2}\) are the charges, \(r\) is the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force \(\left(\text{G}.\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\right)\) where \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) are the masses, \(r\) is the distance of separation of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. When classical mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it shows that the planets describe well-defined orbits around the sun. The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements. The similarity between the solar system and nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined orbits. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration (even if the body is moving with a constant speed in an orbit, it must accelerate because of changing direction). So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are unchanged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation comes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10* s to spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model cannot explain the stability of an atom. If the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that since the motion of electrons in orbits is leading to the instability of the atom, then why not consider electrons as stationary around the nucleus. If the electrons were stationary, electrostatic attraction between the dense nucleus and the electrons would pull the electrons toward the nucleus to form a miniature version of Thomson's model of atom.

Another serious drawback of the Rutherford model is that it says nothing about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., how the electrons are distributed around the nucleus and what are the energies of these electrons.

2.3 DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO THE BOHR'S MODEL OF ATOM Historically, results observed from the studies of interactions of radiations with matter have provided immense information regarding the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr utilised these results to improve upon the model proposed by Rutherford. Two developments played a major role in the formulation of Bohr's model of atom. These were:

1. Dual character of the electromagnetic radiation which means that radiations possess both wave like and particle like properties, and
2. Experimental results regarding atomic spectra which can be explained only by assuming quantized (Section 2.4) electronic energy levels in atoms.

2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation James Maxwell (1870) was the first to give a comprehensive explanation about the interaction between the charged bodies and the behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields on macroscopic level. He suggested that when electrically charged particle moves under accelaration, alternating electrical and magnetic fields are produced and transmitted. These fields are transmitted in the forms of waves called **electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation**.

Light is the form of radiation known from early days and speculation about its nature dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier days (Newton) light was supposed to be made of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the 19th century when wave nature of light was established.

Maxwell was again the first to reveal that light waves are associated with oscillating electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6). Although electromagnetic wave motion is complex in nature, we will consider here only a few simple properties.

1. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields produced by oscillating charged particles are perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. Simplified picture of electromagnetic wave is shown in Fig. 2.6.

**Fig.2.6**: _The electric and magnetic field components of an electromagnetic wave. These components have the same wavelength frequency. speed and amplitude. but they vibrate in two mutually perpendicular planes._
2. Unlike sound waves or water waves, electromagnetic waves do not require medium and can move in vacuum.
3. It is now well established that there are many types of electromagnetic radiations, which differ from one another in wavelength (or frequency). These constitute what is called electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7). Different regions of the spectrum are identified by different names. Some examples are: radio frequency region around \(10^{6}\) Hz, used for broadcasting; microwave region around \(10^{10}\) Hz used for radar; infrared region around \(10^{13}\) Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region around \(10^{15}\)Hz a component of sun's radiation. The small portion around \(10^{15}\) Hz, is what is ordinarily called **visible light**. It is only this part which our eyes can see (or detect). Special instruments are required to detect non-visible radiation.
* Different kinds of units are used to represent electromagnetic radiation. These radiations are characterised by the properties, namely, frequency (\(\nu\)) and wavelength (\(\lambda\)).

The SI unit for frequency (\(\nu\)) is hertz (Hz, s-1), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as the number of waves that pass a given point in one second.

Wavelength should have the units of length and as you know that the SI units of length is meter (m). Since electromagnetic radiation consists of different kinds of waves of much smaller wavelengths, smaller units are used. Fig.2.7 shows various types of electro-magnetic radiations which differ from one another in wavelengths and frequencies.

In vaccum all types of electromagnetic radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at the same speed, i.e., 3.0 \(10^{8}\) m s-1 (2.997925 \(10^{8}\) m s-1, to be precise). This is called **speed of light** and is given the symbol 'c'. The frequency (\(\nu\)), wavelength (\(\lambda\)) and velocity of light (c) are related by the equation (2.5).

c = \(\nu\lambda\) (2.5)

The other commonly used quantity specially in spectroscopy, is the **wavenumber** (\(\overline{\nu}\)). _It is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit length_. Its units are reciprocal of wavelength unit, i.e., m-1. However commonly used unit is cm-1 (not SI unit).

**Problem 2.3**

The Vividh Bharati station of All India Radio. Delhi, broadcasts on a frequency of 1,368 kHz (kilo hertz). Calculate the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by transmitter. Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum does it belong to?

**Solution**

The wavelength \(\lambda\), is equal to c/\(\nu\), where c is the speed of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum and \(\nu\) is the

Figure 2.7: (a) The **spe**drum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only a small part of the entire **spe**drum.

frequency. Substituting the given values, we have \(\lambda=\frac{\mathrm{c}}{\nu}\) \(=\frac{3.00\times 10^{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{m}}{1368\ \mathrm{kHz}}\) \(=\frac{3.00\times 10^{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{m}}{1368\times 10^{\mathrm{a}}}\); \(=219.3\mathrm{m}\) This is a characteristic radiowave wavelength.

**Problem 2.4**: The wavelength range of the visible spectrum extends from violet (400 nm) to red (750 nm). Express these wavelengths in frequencies (Hz). (1nm = 10\({}^{\mathrm{a}}\)m)
**Solution**

Using equation 2.5, frequency of violet light \(\nu=\frac{\mathrm{c}}{\lambda}=\frac{3.00\times}{400}\) \(=7.50\ \ 10^{\mathrm{14}}\ \mathrm{Hz}\) \(=4.00\ \ 10^{\mathrm{14}}\ \mathrm{Hz}\) The range of visible spectrum is from \(4.0\ 10^{\mathrm{14}}\) to \(7.5\ \ 10^{\mathrm{14}}\ \mathrm{Hz}\) in terms of frequency units.

**Problem 2.5**: Calculate (a) wavenumber and (b) frequency of yellow radiation having wavelength 5800 A.
**Solution**

(a) Calculation of wavenumber (\(\overline{\nu}\)) \(\lambda=\)5800 A=58 \(=5\)

#### 2.3.2 Particle Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation: Planck's Quantum Theory

Some of the experimental phenomenon such as diffraction* and interference** can be explained by the wave nature of the electromagnetic radiation. However, following are some of the observations which could not be explained with the help of even the electromagnetic theory of 19th century physics (known as classical physics):

**(i)**: the nature of emission of radiation from hot bodies (black -body radiation)
**(ii)**: selection of electrons from metal surface when radiation strikes it (photoelectric effect)
**(iii)**: variation of heat capacity of solids as a function of temperature
**(iv)**: line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen.

It is noteworthy that the first concrete explanation for the phenomenon of the black body radiation was given by Max Planck in 1900. This phenomenon is given below:

When solids are heated they emit radiation over a wide range of wavelengths. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace, it first turns to dull red and then progressively becomes more and more red as the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. In terms of frequency, it means that the radiation emitted goes from a lower frequency to a higher frequency as the temperature increases. The red colour lies in the lower frequency region while blue colour belongs to the higher frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. _The ideal body, which emits and absorbs all frequencies, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation_. The exact frequency distribution of the emitted radiation (i.e., intensity versus frequency curve of the radiation) from a black body depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with decrease of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further decrease of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8.

The above experimental results cannot be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the wave theory of light. Planck suggested that atoms and molecules could emit (or absorb) energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner, a belief popular at that time. Planck gave the name **quantum** to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (\(E\)) of a quantum of radiation is proportional to its frequency (\(v\)) and is expressed by equation (2.6).

\[E=hv \tag{2.6}\]

The proportionality constant, '\(h\)' is known as Planck's constant and has the value 6.626 10\({}^{\text{-34}}\)J s.

With this theory, Planck was able to explain the distribution of intensity in the radiation from black body as a function of frequency or wavelength at different temperatures.

_Photoelectric Effect_

In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting experiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown in Fig. 2.9. The phenomenon is called

Figure 2.8: Wavelength-intensity relationship

Figure 2.9: Equment for studying the photoelectric effect. Light of a particular frequency strikes a clean metal surface inside a vacuum chamber. Electrons are ejected from the metal and are counted by a detector that measures their kinetic energy.

**Photoelectric effect**. The results observed in this experiment were: (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal surface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface. (ii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light. (iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum (\(\nu_{\circ}\)) (also known as **threshold frequency**) below which photoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency \(\nu>\nu_{\circ}\), the ejected electrons come out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used. All the above results could not be explained on the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number of electrons ejected does depend upon the brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons does not. For example, red light (\(\nu\) = (4.3 to 4.6) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz) of any brightness (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (\(\nu=5.1-5.2\) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz) shines on the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (\(\nu_{\circ}\)) for potassium metal is 5.0 10\({}^{14}\) Hz. Einstein (1905) was able to explain the photoelectric effect using Planck's quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point.

Shining a beam of light on to a metal surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting a beam of particles, the photons. When a photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron in the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy instantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Since the striking photon has energy equal to \(h\nu\) and the minimum energy required to eject the electron is \(h\nu_{\circ}\) (also called work function, W\({}_{\circ}\); Table 2.2), then the difference in energy (\(h\nu-h\nu_{\circ}\)) is transferred as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.

\[h\nu=h\nu_{\circ}+\frac{1}{2}\,r \tag{2.7}\]

where m\({}_{e}\) is the mass of the electron and \(\nu\) is the velocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed.

_Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic Radiation_

The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for scientists. On the one hand, itcould explain the black body radiation and photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light has dual behaviour. Depending on the experiment, we find that light behaves either as a wave or as a stream of particles. Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it displays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.

**Problem 2.6**

Calculate energy of one mole of photons of radiation whose frequency is 5 \(\times 10^{14}\) Hz.

**Solution**

Energy (\(E\)) of one photon is given by the expression

\(E=h\nu\)

\(h=6.626\)\(10^{-34}\) J s

\(\nu=5\)\(10^{34}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (given)

\(E=(6.626\)\(10^{+4}\) J s) (5 \(10^{14}\) s\({}^{-1}\))

= 3.313 \(10^{-18}\) J

Energy of one mole of photons

= (3.313 \(10^{-19}\) J) (6.022 \(10^{23}\) mol\({}^{-1}\))

= 199.51 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Problem 2.7**

A 100 watt bulb emits monochromatic light of wavelength 400 nm. Calculatelongest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) Hz to red at 4\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) Hz. Such a spectrum is called **continuous spectrum**. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

### Emission and Absorption Spectra

The spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an **emission spectrum**. Atoms, molecules or ions that have absorbed radiation are said to be **"excited"**. To produce an emission spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded.

An absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed through a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum.

The study of emission or absorption spectra is referred to as **spectroscopy**. The spectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to violet, rather they emit light only at specific wavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra are called **line spectra** or **atomic spectra** because the emitted radiation is identified by the appearance of bright lines in the spectra (Fig, 2.10)

**Line emission spectra** are of great interest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify unknown atoms in the same way as finger prints are used to identify people. The exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the lines from an unknown sample quickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was one of the first investigators to use line spectra to identify elements.

Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic methods. The element helium (He) was discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.

_Line Spectrum of Hydrogen_

When an electric discharge is passed through gaseous hydrogen, the H\({}_{2}\) molecules dissociate and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms produced emit electromagnetic radiation of _discrete frequencies_. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of _lines_ named after their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on the basis of experimental observations that if spectral lines are expressed in terms of wavenumber (\(\overline{\nu}\)), then the visible lines of the hydrogen spectrum obey the following formula :

\[\overline{\nu}=109,677\ \left(\right. \tag{2.8}\]

where \(n\) is an integer equal to or greater than 3 (i.e., \(n=3,4,5,.....\))

Figure 2.10: **(a) Atomic emission.** The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms (or any other element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any sample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as these atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. **(b) Atomic absorption.** When white light is passed through unexcited atomic hydrogen and then through a slit and prism, the transmitted light is lacking in intensity at the same wavelengths as are emitted in **(a)** The recorded absorption spectrum is also a line spectrum and the photographic negative of the emission spectrum.

The series of lines described by this formula are called the Balmer series. The Balmer series of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen spectrum which appear in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish spectroscopist, Johannes Rydberg, noted that all series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum could be described by the following expression :

\[\overline{r}=109,677\left(\right. \tag{2.9}\]

where \(n_{{}_{1}}\)=1.2.......

\(n_{{}_{2}}=n_{{}_{1}}+1\), \(n_{{}_{1}}+2.......\)

The value 109,677 cm-1 is called the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. The first five series of lines that correspond to \(n_{{}_{1}}\) = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are known as Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Bracket and Pfund series, respectively, Table 2.3 shows these series of transitions in the hydrogen spectrum. Fig 2.11 shows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series of transitions for hydrogen atom.

Of all the elements, hydrogen atom has the simplest line spectrum. Line spectrum becomes more and more complex for heavier atom. There are however certain features which are common to all line spectra, i.e., (i) line spectrum of element is unique and (ii) there is regularity in the line spectrum of each element. The questions which arise are : What are the reasons for these similarities? Is it something to do with the electronic structure of atoms? These are the questions need to be answered. We shall find later that the answers to these questions provide the key in understanding electronic structure of these elements.

### 2.4 Bohr's Model for Hydrogen Atom

Neils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain quantitatively the general features of hydrogen atom structure and its spectrum. Though the theory is not the modern quantum mechanics, it can still be used to rationalize many points in the atomic structure and spectra. Bohr's model for hydrogen atom is based on the following postulates:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Series** & \(n_{{}_{1}}\) & \(n_{{}_{2}}\) & **Spectral Region** \\ \hline Lyman & 1 & 2,3.... & Ultraviolet \\ Balmer & 2 & 3,4.... & Visible \\ Paschen & 3 & 4,5.... & Infrared \\ Brackett & 4 & 5,6.... & Infrared \\ Pfund & 5 & 6,7.... & Infrared \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.3: The Spectral Lines for Atomic Hydrogen

Figure 2.11: Transitions of the electron in the hydrogen atom (The diagram shows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series of transitions)

electron will move from a lower stationary state to a higher stationary state when required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron or energy is emitted when electron moves from higher stationary state to lower stationary state (equation 2.16). The energy change does not take place in a continuous manner.

The frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted when transition occurs between two stationary states that differ in energy by \(\Delta E\), is given by :

\[\nu=\frac{\Delta E}{h}=\frac{E_{2}-}{h} \tag{2.10}\]

Where \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are the energies of the lower and higher allowed energy states respectively. This expression is commonly known as Bohr's frequency rule.

The angular momentum of an electron in a given stationary state can be expressed as in equation (2.11)

\[m_{e}\,\nu\,r\,=\,n\,\frac{h}{2\pi}\quad n=1,2,3....\,. \tag{2.11}\]

Thus an electron can move only in those orbits for which its angular momentum is integral multiple of \(h/2\pi\) that is why only certain fixed orbits are allowed.

The details regarding the derivation of energies of the stationary states used by Bohr, are quite complicated and will be discussed in higher classes. However, according to Bohr's theory for hydrogen atom:

The stationary states for electron are numbered \(n=1,2,3,.........\). These integral numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as **Principal quantum numbers**.

The radii of the stationary states are expressed as :

\[r_{n}=n^{2}\,a_{0} \tag{2.12}\]

where \(a_{0}=52,9\) pm. Thus the radius of the first stationary state, called the **Bohr radius**, is \(52.9\) pm. Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit (that is \(n\)=1). As \(n\) increases the value of \(r\) will increase. In other words the electron will be present away from the nucleus.

The most important property associated with the electron, is the energy of its stationary state. It is given by the expression.

\[E_{n}=-R_{n}\bigg{(}\frac{1}{n^{2}}\qquad\qquad n=1,2,3....\,. \tag{2.13}\]

where \(R_{n}\) is called **Ry dberg constant** and its value is \(2.18\times 10^{-18}\) J. The energy of the lowest state, also called as the ground state, is \(E_{1}=-2.18\times 10^{-18}\) (\(\frac{1}{1^{2}}\)) = \(-2.18\times 10^{-18}\) J. The energy of the stationary state for n = 2, will be : \(E_{2}=-2.18\times 10^{-18}\)J (\(\frac{1}{2^{2}}\))= \(-0.545\times 10^{-18}\)J.

In case of absorption spectrum, \(n_{\rm{f}}\)? \(n_{\rm{i}}\) and the term in the parenthesis is positive and energy is absorbed. On the other hand in case of emission spectrum \(n_{\rm{i}}\)? \(n_{\rm{f}}\), \(\Delta E\) is negative and energy is released.

The expression (2.17) is similar to that used by Rydberg (2.9) derived empirically using the experimental data available at that time. Further, each spectral line, whether in absorption or emission spectrum, can be associated to the particular transition in hydrogen atom. In case of large number of hydrogen atoms, different possible transitions can be observed and thus leading to large number of spectral lines. The brightness or intensity of spectral lines depends upon the number of photons of same wavelength or frequency absorbed or emitted.

**Problem 2.10**

What are the frequency and wavelength of a photon emitted during a transition from \(n=5\) state to the \(n=2\) state in the hydrogen atom?

**Solution**

Since \(n_{\rm{i}}=5\) and \(n_{\rm{i}}=2\), this transition gives rise to a spectral line in the visible region of the Balmer series. From equation (2.17)

\[\Delta E=2.18\times 10\]

\[=-4.58\times 1\]

It is an emission energy

The frequency of the photon (taking energy in terms of magnitude) is given by

\[\nu=\frac{\Delta E}{h}\]

\[.\] \[=\frac{4.58}{6.626}\frac{10^{-1}}{10^{-3}}\]

\[=6.91\frac{10^{14}}{14}\,\rm{Hz}\]

\[\lambda=\frac{c}{\nu}=\frac{3.0\times}{6.91}\]

**Problem 2.11**

Calculate the energy associated with the first orbit of He'. What is the radius of this orbit?

**Solution**

\[E_{n}=-\frac{(2.18\times 1)}{t}\] atom-1

For He', \(n=1,Z=2\)

\[E_{1}=-\frac{(2.18\times 1)}{t}\]

The radius of the orbit is given by equation (2.15)

\[\Gamma_{n}=\frac{(0.0529\,n}{Z}\]

Since \(n=1\), and \(Z=2\)

\[\Gamma_{n}=\frac{(0.0529\,n}{2}\]

#### 2.4.2 Limitations of Bohr's Model

Bohrs model of the hydrogen atom was no doubt an improvement over Rutherford's nuclear model, as it could account for the stability and line spectra of hydrogen atom and hydrogen likeions (for example, He', Li', Be', and so on). However, Bohr's model was too simple to account for the following points.

**i)** It fails to account for the finer details (doublet, that is two closely spaced lines) of the hydrogen atom spectrum observedby using sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. This model is also unable to explain the spectrum of atoms other than hydrogen, for example, helium atom which possesses only two electrons. Further, Bohr's theory was also unable to explain the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an electric field (Stark effect). ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms to form molecules by chemical bonds.

In other words, taking into account the points mentioned above, one needs a better theory which can explain the salient features of the structure of complex atoms.

### TOWARDS QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF THE ATOM

In view of the shortcoming of the Bohr's model, attempts were made to develop a more suitable and general model for atoms. Two important developments which contributed significantly in the formulation of such a model were :

1. Dual behaviour of matter,
2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

### Dual Behaviour of Matter

The French physicist, de Broglie in 1924 proposed that matter, like radiation, should also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle and wavelike properties. This means that just as the photon has momentum as well as wavelength, electrons should also have momentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie, from this analogy, gave the following relation between wavelength (\(\lambda\)) and momentum (p) of a material particle.

\[\dot{\lambda}=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{h}{p} \tag{2.22}\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the particle, v its velocity and \(p\) its momentum. de Broglie's prediction was confirmed experimentally when it was found that an electron beam undergoes diffraction, a phenomenon characteristic of waves. This fact has been put to use in making an electron microscope, which is based on the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature of light. An electron microscope is a powerful tool in modern scientific research because it achieves a magnification of about 15 million times.

It needs to be noted that according to de Broglie, every object in motion has a wave character. The wavelengths associated with ordinary objects are so short (because of their large masses) that their wave properties cannot be detected. The wavelengths associated with electrons and other subatomic particles (with very small mass) can however be detected experimentally. Results obtained from the following problems prove these points qualitatively.

**Problem 2.12**

What will be the wavelength of a ball of mass 0.1 kg moving with a velocty of 10 m s-1?

**Solution**

According to de Broglie equation (2.22)

\[\dot{\lambda}=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{(6.2}{0.1}\]

= 6.626 10^{-34}\) m (J = kg m\({}^{2}\) s-2)

**Problem 2.13**

The mass of an electron is 9.1\(\times\)10^-31 kg. If its K.E. is 3.0\(\times\)10^-25 J, calculate its wavelength.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:47]

simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron.

**The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects.** This can be seen from the following examples.

If uncertainty principle is applied to an object of mass, say about a milligram (10\({}^{\text{-6}}\) kg), then

\[\Delta\mathbf{v}.\Delta\mathbf{x} =\frac{h}{4\,\pi m}\] \[=\frac{6.6\,\zeta}{4\,3.1}\]

The value of \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\Delta\mathbf{x}\) obtained is extremely small and is insignificant. Therefore, one may say that **in dealing with milligram-sized or heavier objects, the associated uncertainties are hardly of any real consequence.**

In the case of a microscopic object like an electron on the other hand. \(\Delta\mathbf{v}.\Delta\mathbf{x}\) obtained is much larger and such uncertainties are of real consequence. For example, for an electron whose mass is 9,11 10\({}^{\text{-31}}\) kg., according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle

\[\Delta\mathbf{v}.\Delta\mathbf{x} =\frac{h}{4\pi m}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{6.626}{4\,3.1416}\] \[=10\ ^{4}\text{m}^{2}\text{s}\ ^{1}\]

It, therefore, means that if one tries to find the exact location of the electron, say to an uncertainty of only 10\({}^{\text{-6}}\) m, then the uncertainty \(\Delta\mathbf{v}\) in velocity would be

\[\frac{10^{\text{-4}}\text{m}^{2}\text{s}^{\text{-1}}}{10^{\text{-6}}\,\text{m}} = 1\]

which is so large that the classical picture of electrons moving in Bohr's orbits (fixed) cannot hold good. **It, therefore, means that the precise statements of the position and momentum of electrons have to be replaced by the statements of probability, that the electron has at a given position and momentum. This is what happens in the quantum mechanical model of atom.**

**Problem 2.15**

A microscope using suitable photons is employed to locate an electron in an atom within a distance of 0.1 A. What is the uncertainty involved in the measurement of its velocity?

**Solution**

\[\Delta\mathbf{x}\,\Delta p =\frac{h}{4\pi}\text{ or }\] \[\cdot\] \[\Delta\mathbf{v} =\frac{h}{4\pi\Delta\mathbf{x}\,m}\]

\[\Delta\mathbf{v} =\frac{4\,3.14\,0}\] \[=0.579\ 10^{\text{r}}\text{ m s}^{\text{-1}}\] \[=5.79\ 10^{\text{r}}\text{ m s}^{\text{-1}}\]

**Problem 2.16**

A golf ball has a mass of 40g, and a speed of 45 m/s. If the speed can be measured within accuracy of 2%, calculate the uncertainty in the position.

**Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976)** _received his PhD. in physics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max Born at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg was in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932._
\begin{tabular}{c} Solution \\ The uncertainty in the speed is 29%, i.e., \\ \(45\) \(\frac{2}{100}\)=0.1 \\ Using the equation (2.22) \\ \(\Delta x=\frac{h}{4\pi m\Delta v}\) \\ \(=\frac{6}{4\ 3.14\ 40}\) \\ \(=1.46\ 10^{-33}\) m \\ This is nearly \(\sim 10^{-3}\) times smaller than the diameter of a typical atomic nucleus. As mentioned earlier for large particles, the uncertainty principle sets no meaningful limit to the precision of measurements. \\ \end{tabular}

_Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model_ One can now understand the reasons for the failure of the Bohr model. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving in well defined circular orbits about the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is not considered in Bohr model. Further, an orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the position and the velocity of the electron are known exactly at the same time. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. _Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores dual behaviour of matter but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle._ In view of these inherent weaknesses in the Bohr model, there was no point in extending Bohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics.

2.6 QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF ATOM

Classical mechanics, based on Newton's laws of motion, successfully describes the motion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account this dual behaviour of matter is called **quantum mechanics**.

Quantum mechanics is a theoretical science that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties. It specifies the laws of motion that these objects obey. When quantum mechanics is applied to macroscopic objects (for which wave like properties are insignificant) the results are the same as those from the classical mechanics.

Quantum mechanics was developed independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrodinger and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes.

For a system (such as an atom or a molecule whose energy does not change with time) the Schrodinger equation is written as \(\not{H}\psi=E\psi\) where \(\not{H}\) is a mathematical operator called Hamiltonian. Schrodinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes in to account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of this equation gives \(E\) and \(\psi\).

_Hydrogen Atom and the Schrodinger Equation_

When Schrodinger equation is solved for hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) (\(\psi\)) of the electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number \(n\), azimuthal quantum number \(l\) and magnetic quantum number \(m\),) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrodinger equation. When an electron is in any energy state, the wave function corresponding to that energy state contains all information about the electron. The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning. Such wave functions of hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one electron are called **atomic orbitals**. Such wave functions pertaining to one-electron species are called one-electron systems. The probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom is proportional to the \(|\psi|^{2}\) at that point. The quantum mechanical results of the hydrogen atom successfully predict all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.

Application of Schrodinger equation to multi-electron atoms presents a difficulty: the Schrodinger equation cannot be solved exactly for a multi-electron atom. This difficulty can be overcome by using approximate methods. Such calculations with the aid of modern computers show that orbitals in atoms other than hydrogen do not differ in any radical way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed above. The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number \(n\), the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron atoms depend on quantum numbers \(n\) and \(l\).

**Important Features of the Quantum Mechanical Model of Atom**

Quantum mechanical model of atom is the picture of the structure of the atom. which emerges from the application of the Schrodinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the quantum-mechanical model of atom:

1. The energy of electrons in atoms is quantized (i.e., can only have certain specific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms.
2. The existence of quantized electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are allowed solutions of Schrodinger wave equation.
3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in an atom cannot be determined simultaneously [Heisenberg uncertainty principle]. The path of an electron in an atom therefore, can never be determined or known accurately. That

**is why, as you shall see later on; one talks of only probability of finding the electron at different points in an atom.**
4. **An atomic orbital is the wave function** \(\psi\) **for an electron in an atom. Whenever an electron is described by a wave function, we say that the electron occupies that orbital. Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These 'one electron orbital wave functions" or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. In each orbital, the electron has a definite energy. An orbital cannot contain more than two electrons. In a multi-electron atom, the electrons are filled in various orbitals in the order of increasing energy. For each electron of a multi-electron atom, there shall, therefore, be an orbital wave function characteritic of the orbital it occupies. All the information about the electron in an atom is stored in its orbital wave function \(\psi\) and quantum mechanics makes it possible to extract this information out of \(\psi\).**
5. **The probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom is proportional to the square of the orbital wave function i.e., \(|\psi|^{2}\) at that point. \(|\psi|^{2}\) is known as probability density and is always positive.** _From the value of \(|\psi|^{2}\) at different points within an atom, it is possible to predict the region around the nucleus where electron will most probably be found._

#### 2.6.1 Orbitals and Quantum Numbers

A large number of orbitals are possible in an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can be distinguished by their size, shape and orientation. An orbital of smaller size means there is more chance of finding the electron near the nucleus. Similarly shape and orientation mean that there is more probability of finding the electron along certain directions than along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely distinguished by what are known as quantum numbers. Each orbital is designated by three quantum numbers labelled as \(n\), \(l\) and \(m_{v}\)

**The principal quantum number '\(n\)' is a positive integer with value of \(n=1,2,3.......\). The principal quantum number determines the _size and to large extent the energy of the orbital._ For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like species (He', Li',.... etc.) energy and size of the orbital depends only on '\(n\)'.

The principal quantum number also identifies the **shell**. With the increase in the value of '\(n\)', the number of allowed orbital increases and **are given by '\(n\)'. All the orbitals of a given value of '\(n\)' constitute a single shell of atom** and are represented by the following letters

\(n=1\)\(2\)\(3\)\(4\).............

Shell = K L M N............

Size of an orbital increases with increase of principal quantum number '\(n\)'. In other words the electron will be located away from the nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting away the negatively charged electron from the positively charged nucleus, the energy of the orbital will increase with increase of \(n\).

**Azimuthal quantum number. '\(l\)' is also known as orbital angular momentum or subsidiary quantum number.** It defines the three dimensional shape of the orbital. For a given value of \(n\), \(l\) can have \(n\) values ranging from 0 to \(n-1\), that is, for a given value of \(n\), the possible value of \(l\) are : \(l=0\), 1, 2,......... (\(n\)-1)

For example, when \(n=1\), value of \(l\) is only 0. For \(n=2\), the possible value of \(l\) can be 0 and 1. For \(n=3\), the possible \(l\) values are 0, 1 and 2.

Each shell consists of one or more **sub-shells** or **sub-levels**. The number of sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the value of \(n\). For example in the first shell (\(n=1\)), there is only one sub-shell which corresponds to \(l=0\). There are two sub-shells (\(l=0\), 1) in the second shell (\(n=2\)), three (\(l=0\), 1, 2) in third shell (\(n=3\)) and so on. Each sub-shell is assigned an azimuthal quantum number (\(l\)). Sub-shells corresponding to different values of \(l\) are represented by the following symbols.

Value for \(l\) : 0 1 2 3 4 5..........

notation for \(s\)\(p\)\(d\)\(f\)\(g\)\(h\)\(........\) sub-shellTable 2.4 shows the permissible values of '\(l\)' for a given principal quantum number and the corresponding sub-shell notation.

Table 2.4 Subshell Notations

Thus for \(l=0\), the only permitted value of \(m_{\_}{\_}{u}=0\), \([2\{0\}+1=1\), one s orbital). For \(l=1\), m\({}_{\_}{\_}{1}\) can be \(-1\), \(0\) and \(+1\)\([2\{1\}+1=3\), three \(p\) orbitals]. For \(l=2\), m\({}_{\_}{1}=-2\), \(-1\), \(0\), \(+1\) and \(+2\), \([2\{2\}+1=5\), five \(d\) orbitals]. It should be noted that the values of \(m_{\_}{\_}{u}\) are derived from \(l\) and that the value of \(l\) are derived from \(n\).

Each orbital in an atom, therefore, is defined by a set of values for \(n\), \(l\) and m\({}_{\_}{r}\). An orbital described by the quantum numbers \(n=2\), \(l=1\), \(m_{\_}{l}=0\) is an orbital in the \(p\) sub-shell of the second shell. The following chart gives the relation between the sub-shell and the number of orbitals associated with it.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Value of \(l\) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline Subshell notation & s & \(p\) & \(d\) & \(f\) & \(g\) & \(h\) \\ \hline number of orbitals & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 9 & 11 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Electron spin's':_ The three quantum numbers labelling an atomic orbital can be used equally well to define its energy, shape and orientation. But all these quantum numbers are not enough to explain the line spectra observed in the case of multi-electron atoms, thatis, some of the lines actually occur in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets (three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests the presence of a few more energy levels than predicted by the three quantum numbers.

In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth quantum number known as the electron spin quantum number (\(m_{s}\)). An electron spins around its own axis, much in a similar way as earth spins around its own axis while revolving around the sun. In other words, an electron has, besides charge and mass, intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron -- a vector quantity, can have two orientations relative to the chosen axis. These two orientations are distinguished by the spin quantum numbers \(m_{s}\) which can take the values of +% or -%. These are called the two spin states of the electron and are normally represented by two arrows. \(\uparrow\) (spin up) and \(\downarrow\) (spin down). Two electrons that have different \(m_{s}\) values (one +% and the other -%) are said to have opposite spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two electrons and these two electrons should have opposite spins.

To sum up, the four quantum numbers provide the following information :

1. \(n\) defines the shell, determines the size of the orbital and also to a large extent the energy of the orbital.
2. There are \(n\) subshells in the nth shell. It identifies the subshell and determines the shape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each type in a subshell, that is, one \(s\) orbital (\(l=0\)), three \(p\) orbitals (\(l=1\)) and five \(d\) orbitals (\(l=2\)) per subshell. To some extent \(l\) also determines the energy of the orbital in a multi-electron atom.
3. \(m_{s}\) designates the orientation of the orbital. For a given value of \(l\), \(m_{s}\) has (2l+1) values, the same as the number of orbitals per subshell. It means that the number of orbitals is equal to the number of ways in which they are oriented.
4. \(m_{s}\) refers to orientation of the spin of the electron.

**Problem 2.17**

What is the total number of orbitals associated with the principal quantum number \(n=3\)?

**Solution**

For \(n=3\), the possible values of \(l\) are 0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3\(s\) orbital (\(n=3\), \(l=0\) and \(m_{s}=0\)); there are three 3\(p\) orbitals (\(n=3\), \(l=1\) and \(m_{s}=-1\), 0, +1); there are five 3\(d\) orbitals (\(n=3\), \(l=2\) and \(m_{s}=-2\), \(-1\), 0, +1+, +2).

Therefore, the total number of orbitals is 1+3+5 = 9

The same value can also be obtained by using the relation; number of orbitals \(n=n^{2}\), i.e. \(3^{2}=9\).

**Problem 2.18**

Using \(s\), \(p\), \(d\), f notations, describe the orbital with the following quantum numbers

(a) \(n=2\), \(l=1\), (b) \(n=4\), \(l=0\), (c) \(n=5\), \(l=3\), (d) \(n=3\), \(l=2\)

**Solution**

\(n\)\(l\) orbital

a) \(2\)\(1\)\(2p\)

b) \(4\)\(0\)\(4s\)

c) \(5\)\(3\)\(5f\)

d) \(3\)\(2\)\(3d\)

#### 2.6.2 Shapes of Atomic Orbitals

The orbital wave function or \(\psi\) for an electron in an atom has no physical meaning. It is simply a mathematical function of the coordinates of the electron, However, for different orbitals the plots of corresponding wave functions as a function of \(r\)(the distance from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), (page 54) gives such plots for 1s (n = 1, \(l=0\)) and 2s (n = 2, \(l=0\)) orbitals.

According to the German physicist, Max Born, the square of the wave function (i.e.,\(\psi^{2}\)) at a point gives the probability density of the electron at that point. The variation of \(\psi^{2}\)as a function of \(r\) for 1s and 2s orbitals is given in Fig. 2.12(b), (page 54). Here again, you may note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals are different.

It may be noted that for 1s orbital the probability density is maximum at the nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move away from it. On the other hand, for 2s orbital the probability density first decreases sharply to zero and again starts increasing. After reaching a small maxima it decreases again and approaches zero as the value of \(r\) increases further. The region where this probability density function reduces to zero is called **nodal surfaces** or simply **nodes**. In general, it has been found that \(ns\)-orbital has (\(n-1\)) nodes, that is, number of nodes increases with increase of principal quantum number \(n\). In other words, number of nodes for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on.

These probability density variation can be visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams [Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density of the dots in a region represents electron probability density in that region.

**Boundary surface diagrams** of constant probability density for different orbitals give a fairly good representation of the shapes of the orbitals. In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density \(|\psi|^{2}\) is constant. In principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density* is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in which the probability of finding the electron is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, which bounds a region in which the probability of finding the electron is, 100%? The answer to this question is that the probability density \(|\psi|^{2}\) has always some value, howsoever small it may be, at any finite distance from the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size in which the probability of finding the electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram for a \(s\) orbital is actually a sphere centred on the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which probability of finding the electron is about 90%.

Figure 2.12: The plots of (a) the orbital wave function \(\psi(r\) ): (b) the variation of probability density \(|\psi|^{2}\)(r) as a function of distance \(r\) of the electron from the nucleus for 1s and 2s orbitals.

Figure 2.13: (a) Probability density plots of 1s and 2s atomic orbitals. The density of the dots represents the probability density of finding the electron in that region. (b) Boundary surface diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals.

Thus we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability of finding the electron at a given distance is equal in all the directions. It is also observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in \(n\), that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s and the electron is located further away from the nucleus as the principal quantum number increases.

Boundary surface diagrams for three 2\(p\) orbitals (\(l\) = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface diagrams are not spherical. Instead each \(p\) orbital consists of two sections called lobes that are on either side of the plane that passes through the nucleus. The probability density function is zero on the plane where the two lobes touch each other. The size, shape and energy of the three orbitals are identical. They differ however, in the way the lobes are oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the designations 2\(p_{x}\), 2\(p_{y}\), and 2\(p_{z}\). It should be understood, however, that _there is no simple relation between the values of \(m_{i}\) ( 1, 0 and +1) and the x, y and z directions._ For our purpose, it is sufficient to remember that, because there are three possible values of \(m_{i}\), there are, therefore, three \(p\) orbitals whose axes are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, \(p\) orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number and hence the order of the energy and size of various \(p\) orbitals is 4\(p\) > 3\(p\) > 2\(p\). Further, like s orbitals, the probability density functions for \(p\)-orbital also pass through value zero, besides at zero and infinite distance, as the distance from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the \(n\) -2, that is number of radial node is 1 for 3\(p\) orbital, two for 4\(p\) orbital and so on.

For \(l\) = 2, the orbital is known as \(d\)-orbital and the minimum value of principal quantum number (\(n\)) has to be 3. as the value of \(l\) cannot be greater than \(n\)-1. There are five \(m_{i}\) values (-2, -1, 0, +1 and +2) for \(l\) = 2 and thus there are five \(d\) orbitals. The boundary surface diagram of \(d\) orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15, (page 56).

The five \(d\)-orbitals are designated as \(d_{xy}\), \(d_{yz}\), \(d_{yz}\), \(d_{yz,2}\) and \(d_{2}\). The shapes of the first four \(d\)-orbitals are similar to each other, where as that of the fifth one, \(d_{2}\), is different from others, but all five 3\(d\) orbitals are equivalent in energy. The \(d\) orbitals for which \(n\) is greater than 3 (4\(d\), 5\(d\)...) also have shapes similar to 3\(d\) orbital, but differ in energy and size.

Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability density function is zero), the probability density functions for the n\(p\) and n\(d\) orbitals are zero at the plane (s), passing through the nucleus (origin). For example, in case of \(p_{z}\) orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of \(d_{xy}\) orbital, there are two nodal planes passing through the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z-axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular n nodes are given by \(\Gamma\), i.e., one angular n node for \(p\) orbitals, two angular nodes for '\(d\)' orbitals and so on. **The total number of nodes are given by (\(n\)-1), i.e., _sum of \(l\)_ angular nodes and (\(n\) - \(l\) - \(1\)) radial nodes.**

The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is determined solely by the principal quantum

number. Thus the energy of the orbitals increases as follows :

\[1s<2s=2p<3s=3p=3d<4s=4p=4d \tag{2.23}\]

and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the shapes of \(2s\) and \(2p\) orbitals are different, an electron has the same energy when it is in the \(2s\) orbital as when it is present in \(2p\) orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called **degenerate.** The \(1s\) in a hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the **ground state** and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the \(2s\), \(2p\) or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in **excited state.**

The energy of an electron in a multi-electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen atom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, \(s\), \(p\), \(d\), \(f\)... all have different energies. The main reason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in a multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged

Figure 2.16: Energy level diagrams for the few electronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers.

nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus. Due to the presence of electrons in the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge on the nucleus (Ze), but will be lowered due to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the **shielding of the outshell electrons from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons,** and the net positive charge experienced by the electron from the nucleus is known as **effective nuclear charge** (Ze). Despite the shielding of the outer electrons from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increase with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron (that is orbital energy) decreases (that is more negative) with the increase of atomic number (Z).

Both the attractive and repulsive interactions depend upon the shell and shape of the orbitalin which the electron is present. For example, being spherical in shape, the s orbital shields the electrons from the nucleus more effectively as compared to \(p\) orbital. Similarly because of difference in their shapes, \(p\) orbitals shield the electrons from the nucleus more than the \(d\) orbitals, even though all these orbitals are present in the same shell. Further due to spherical shape, s orbital electron spends more time close to the nucleus in comparison to \(p\) orbital and \(p\) orbital spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to \(d\) orbital. In other words, for a given shell (principal quantum number), the \(Z_{\rm eff}\) experienced by the orbital decreases with increase of azimuthal quantum number (\(l\)), that is, the _s orbital will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than \(p\) orbital and \(p\) orbital in turn will be better tightly bound than the \(d\) orbital._ The energy of s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of \(p\) orbital and that of \(p\) orbital will be less, than that of \(d\) orbital and so on. Since the extent of shielding of the nucleus is different for different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of the energies of the orbitals within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of the orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of \(n\) and \(l\). Mathematically, the dependence of energies of the orbitals on n and \(l\) are quite complicated but one simple rule is that of combined value of \(n\) and \(l\). **The lower the value of (\(n+0\)) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same value of (\(n+l\)), the orbital with lower value of n will have the lower energy.** The Table 2.5. (page 57) ilhstrates the (\(n+l\)) rule and Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that **energies of the orbitals in the same subshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z\({}_{\rm eff}\))**. For example, energy of 2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than that of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium is greater than that of sodium and so on, that is, \(E_{\rm 2s}(\rm H)>E_{\rm 2s}(\rm Li)>E_{\rm 2s}(\rm Na)>E_{\rm 2s}(\rm K)\).

#### 2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in Atom

The filling of electrons into the orbitals of different atoms takes place according to the _aufbau_ principle which is based on the Pauli's exclusion principle, the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity and the relative energies of the orbitals.

_Aufbau Principle_

The word '_aufbau_' in German means 'building up'. The building up of orbitals means the filling up of orbitals with electrons. The principle states : **In the ground state of the atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies.** In other words, electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital available to them and enter into higher energy orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are filled.

The order in which the energies of the orbitals increase and hence the order in which the orbitals are filled is as follows :

1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s,..

The order may be remembered by using the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from the top, the direction of the arrows gives the order of filling of orbitals, that is starting from right top to bottom left.

#### Pauli Exclusion Principle

The number of electrons to be filled in various orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli (1926). According to this principle : **No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.** Pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as : **Only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin.** This means that the two electrons can have the same value of three quantum numbers \(n\), \(l\) and \(m_{n}\), but must have the opposite spin quantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli's exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises of one orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in \(p\) and \(d\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:59]

The electronic configuration of the elements sodium (Na, 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{1}\)) to argon (Ar,1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)), follow exactly the same pattern as the elements from lithium to neon with the difference that the 3s and 3p orbitals are getting filled now. This process can be simplified if we represent the total number of electrons in the first two shells by the name of element neon (Ne). The electronic configuration of the elements from sodium to argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s\({}^{1}\)) to (Ar, [Ne] 3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)). The electrons in the completely filled shells are known as core electrons and the electrons that are added to the electronic shell with the highest principal quantum number are called **valence electrons**. For example, the electrons in Ne are the core electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in energy than the 3\(d\) orbitals, is occupied by one and two electrons respectively.

A new pattern is followed beginning with scandum (Sc). The 3\(d\) orbital, being lower in energy than the 4\(p\) orbital, is filled first. Consequently, in the next ten elements, scandum (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), the five 3\(d\) orbitals are progressively occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact that chromium and copper have five and ten electrons in 3\(d\) orbitals rather than four and nine as their position would have indicated with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The reason is that fully filled orbitals and half-filled orbitals have extra stability (that is, lower energy). Thus \(p^{3}\), \(p^{6}\), \(d^{5}\), \(d^{10}\)\(f^{7}\), \(f^{14}\) etc. configurations, which are either half-filled or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium and copper therefore adopt the \(d^{5}\) and \(d^{10}\) configuration (Section 2.6.7)[\(caution\): _exceptions do exist_]

With the saturation of the 3\(d\) orbitals, the filling of the 4\(p\) orbital starts at gallium (Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb) to xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5s, 4\(d\) and 5\(p\) orbitals are similar to that of 4s, 3\(d\) and 4\(p\) orbitals as discussed above. Then comes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium (Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains one and two electrons, respectively. Then from lanthanum (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up of electrons takes place in 4\(f\) and 5\(d\) orbitals. After this, filling of 6\(p\), then 7s and finally 5\(f\) and 6\(d\) orbitals takes place. The elements after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them are produced artificially. The electronic configurations of the known elements (as determined by spectroscopic methods) are tabulated in Table 2.6.

One may ask what is the utility of knowing the electron configuration? The modern approach to the chemistry, infact, depends almost entirely on electronic distribution to understand and explain chemical behaviour. For example, questions like why two or more atoms combine to form molecules, why some elements are metals while others are non-metals, why elements like helium and argon are not reactive but elements like the halogens are reactive, find simple explanation from the electronic configuration. These questions have no answer in the Daltonian model of atom. A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of atom is, therefore, very essential for getting an insight into the various aspects of modern chemical knowledge.

#### 2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and Half Filled Subshells

The ground state electronic configuration of the atom of an element always corresponds to the state of the lowest total electronic energy. The electronic configurations of most of the atoms follow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and 3\(d\)) differ slightly in their energies, an electron shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s) to a subshell of higher energy (3\(d\)), provided such a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell of higher energy getting either completely filled or half filled. The valence electronic configurations of Cr and Cu, therefore, are 3\(d^{5}\)4s\({}^{1}\) and 3\(d^{10}\)4s\({}^{1}\) respectively and not 3\(d^{14}\)4s\({}^{2}\) and 3\(d^{10}\)4s\({}^{2}\). It has been found that there is extra stability associated with these electronic configurations.

## 11 Causes of Stability of Completely Filled and Half Filled Sub-shells

The completely filled and completely half filled sub-shells are stable due to the following reasons:

_1.Symmetrical distribution of electrons:_It is well known that symmetry leads to stability. The completely filled or half filled subshells have symmetrical distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable. Electrons in the same subshell (here \(3d\)) have equal energy but different spatial distribution. Consequently, their shielding of one-another is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus.

_2. Exchange Energy :_ The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is either half filled or completely filled (Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability.

You may note that the exchange energy is at the basis of Hund's rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability of half-filled and completely filled subshell is due to: (i) relatively small shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. Details about the exchange energy will be dealt with in higher classes.

## Summary

Atoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as the ultimate industible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons. protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.

Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford's famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in **circular orbits**. **Rutherford model**, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is ignored in Bohr's theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Erwin Schrodinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrodinger equation to describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie's concept of **wave-particle duality** and is consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrodinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (**principal quantum number n. azimuthal quantum number l** and **magnetic quantum number m**) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrodinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.

According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an atom containing a number of electrons is divided into **shells**. The shells, in turn, are thought to consist of one or more **subshells** and **subshells** are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He\({}^{+}\), Li\({}^{+}\) etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of \(n\) and \(l\): The lower the value of \(\left\{n+l\right\}\) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same \(\left\{n+l\right\}\) value, the orbital with lower value of \(n\) has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in

## Chapter 3 Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties

### 3.1 Why Downeed to Classify Elements?

We know by now that the elements are the basic units of all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By 1865, the number of identified elements had more than doubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. Efforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With such a large number of elements it is very difficult to study individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to organise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not only that it would rationalize known chemical facts about elements, but even predict new ones for undertaking further study.

### GENESIS OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION

Classification of elements into groups and development of Periodic Law and Periodic Table are the consequences of systematising the knowledge gained by a number of scientists through their observations and experiments. The German chemist, Johann Dobereiner in early 1800's was the first to consider the idea of trends among properties of elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity among the physical and chemical properties of several groups of three elements (**Triads**). In each case, he noticed that the middle element of each of the **Triads** had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties of the middle element were in between those of the other chemist, John Alexander Newlands in 1865 profound the **Law of O' octaves**. He arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the first element (Table 3.2). The relationship was just like every eighth note that resembles the first in octaves of music. Newlands's Law of Octaves seemed to be true only for elements up to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the Royal Society, London.

The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895). Working independently, both the chemists in 1869 **Table 3.1 Dobereiner's Triads**

\begin{tabular}{|p{45.5pt}|p{45.5pt}|p{45.5pt}|p{45.5pt}|p{45.5pt}|p{45.5pt}|} \hline
**Element** & **Atomic weight** & **Element weight** & **Atomic weight** & **Element weight** \\ \hline
**Li** & 7 & **Ca** & 40 & **CI** & 35.5 \\
**Na** & \(23\) & **Sr** & 88 & **Br** & 80 \\
**K** & 39 & **Ba** & 137 & **I** & 127 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

two members. Since Dobereiner's relationship, referred to as the **Law of Triads**, seemed to work only for a few elements, it was dismissed as coincidence. The next reported attempt to classify elements was made by a French geologist, A.E.B. de Chan courtois in 1862. He arranged the then known elements in order of increasing atomic weights and made a cylindrical table of elements to display the periodic recurrence of properties. This also did not attract much attention. The English chemist, John Alexander Newlands in 1865 increasing order of their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the first element (Table 3.2). The relationship was just like every eighth note that resembles the first in octaves of music. Newlands's Law of Octaves seemed to be true only for elements up to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the Royal Society, London.

The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895). Working independently, both the chemists in 1869 **Table 3.1 Dobereiner's Triads**

* [73] C:ChemistryXlUnit-3Unit-3(5)Lay-7.pmd 6.1.2006 (Final) 17.1.6, 24.1.6Dmitri Mendeleev was born in Tobalsk. Siberia in Russia. After his father's death. the family moved to St. Petersburg. He received his Master's degree in Chemistry in 1856 and the doctoral degree in 1865. He taught at the University of St.Petersburg where he was appointed Professor of General Chemistry in 1867. Preliminary work for his great textbook "Principles of Chemistry" led Mendeleev to propose the Periodic Law and to construct his Periodic Table of elements. At that time, the structure of atom was unknown and Mendeleev's idea to consider that the properties of the elements were in someway related to their atomic masses was a very imaginative one. To place certain elements into the correct group from the point of view of their chemical properties. Mendeleev reversed the order of some pairs of elements and asserted that their atomic masses were incorrect. Mendeleev also had the foresight to leave gaps in the Periodic Table for elements unknown at that time and predict their properties from the trends that he observed among the properties of related elements. Mendeleev's predictions were proved to be astonishingly correct when these elements were discovered later. Mendeleev's Periodic Law spurred several areas of research during the subsequent decades. The discovery of the first two noble gases helium and argon in 1890 suggested the possibility that there must be other similar elements to fill an entire family. This idea led Ramsay to his successful search for krypton and xenon. Work on the radioactive decay series for uranium and thorium in the early years of twentieth century was also guided by the Periodic Table. Mendeleev was a versatile genius. He worked on many problems connected with Russia's natural resources. He invented an accurate barometer. In 1890. he resigned from the Professorship. He was appointed as the Director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures. He continued to carry out important research work in many areas until his death in 1907. You will notice from the modern Period Table (Fig. 3.2) that Mendeleev's name has been immortalized by naming the element with atomic number 101. as Mendeleev. This name was proposed by American scientist Glenn T. Seaborg, the discoverer of this element. "In recognition of the pioneering role of the great Russian Chemist who was the first to use the periodic system of elements to predict the chemical properties of undiscovered elements. a principle which has been the key to the discovery of nearly all the trans uranium elements".

### Modern Periodic Law and the Present Form of the Periodic Table

We must bear in mind that when Mendeleev developed his **Periodic T able**, chemists knew nothing about the internal structure of atom. However, the beginning of the 20\({}^{\rm th}\) century witnessed profound developments in theories about sub-atomic particles. In 1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley observed regularities in the characteristic _X ray spectra_ of the elements. A plot of \(\sqrt{\nu}\) (where \(\nu\) is frequency of _X_-rays emitted) against atomic number (_Z_) gave a straight line and not the plot of \(\sqrt{\nu}\)_vs_atomic mass. He thereby showed that the atomic number is a more fundamental property of an element than its atomic mass. **Mendeleev's Periodic Law** was, therefore, accordingly modified. This is known as the **Moden Periodic Law** and can be stated as :

_The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers._

The **Periodic Law** revealed important analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like actinium and protoactinium are also found in pitch blende - an ore of uranium). It stimulated renewed interest in Inorganic Chemistry and has carried into the present with the creation of artificially produced short-lived elements.

You may recall that the atomic number is equal to the nuclear charge (_i.e._, number of protons) or the number of electrons in a neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize the significance of quantum numbers and electronic configurations in periodicity of elements. In fact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law is essentially the consequence of the periodic variation in electronic configurations, which indeed determine the physical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds.

Numerous forms of Periodic Table have been devised from time to time. Some forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas othersstress the electronic configuration of elements. A modern version, the so-called **'long form"** of the **Periodic Table** of the elements (Fig. 3.2), is the most convenient and widely used. The horizontal rows (which Mendeleev called **series**) are called **periods** and the vertical columns, **groups**. Elements having similar outer electronic configurations in their atoms are arranged in vertical columns, referred to as **groups** or **families**. According to the recommendation of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the groups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing the older notation of groups IA... VIIA, VIII, IB... VIIB and 0.

There are altogether seven periods. The period number corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (\(n\)) of the elements in the period. The first period contains 2 elements. The subsequent periods consists of 8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The seventh period is incomplete and like the sixth period would have a theoretical maximum (on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 elements. In this form of the Periodic Table, 14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods (lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are placed in separate panels at the bottom\({}^{\rm s}\).

### Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Numbers > 100

The naming of the new elements had been traditionally the privilege of the discoverer (or discoverers) and the suggested name was ratified by the IUPAC. In recent years this has led to some controversy. The new elements with very high atomic numbers are so unstable that only minute quantities, sometimes only a few atoms of them are obtained. Their synthesis and characterisation, therefore, require highly

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:77]

Thus, the new element first gets a temporary name, with symbol consisting of three letters. Later permanent name and symbol are given by a vote of IUPAC representatives from each country. The permanent name might reflect the country (or state of the country) in which the element was discovered, or pay tribute to a notable scientist. As of now, elements with atomic numbers up to 112, 114 and 116 have been discovered. Elements with atomic numbers 1 13, 1 15, 117 and 118 are not yet known.

**Problem 3.1**

What would be the IUPAC name and symbol for the element with atomic number 120?

**Solution**

From Table 3.4, the roots for 1, 2 and 0 are un, bi and nil, respectively. Hence, the symbol and the name respectively are Ubn and unbinilium.

**3.5 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE**

In the preceding unit we have learnt that an electron in an atom is characterised by a set of four quantum numbers, and the principal quantum number (\(n\)) defines the mean energy level known as **shell**. We have also studied about the filling of electrons into different subshells, also referred to as **orbitals** (s, _p, d, f_) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its **electronic configuration**. An element's location in the Periodic Table reflects the quantum numbers of the last orbital filled. In this section we will observe a direct connection between the electronic configurations of the elements and the long form of the Periodic Table.

_(a) Electronic Configurations in Periods_

The period indicates the value of \(n\) for the outermost or valence shell. In other words, successive period in the Periodic Table is associated with the filling of the next higher principal energy level (\(n=1\), \(n=2\), etc.). It can be readily seen that the number of elements in each period is twice the number of atomic **orbitals** available in the energy level that is being filled. The first period (\(n=1\)) starts with the filling of the lowest level (1s) and therefore has two elements -- hydrogen (ls\({}^{2}\)) and helium (ls\({}^{2}\)) when the first shell (\(K\)) is completed. The second period (\(n=2\)) starts with lithium and the third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next element, beryllium has four electrons and has the electronic configuration \(1s^{2}2s^{2}\). Starting from the next element boron, the \(2p\) orbitals are filled with electrons when the \(L\) shell is completed at neon (\(2s^{2}2p^{6}\)). Thus there are 8 elements in the second period. The third period (\(n=3\)) begins at sodium, and the added electron enters a 3s orbital. Successive filling of 3s and 3\(p\) orbitals gives rise to the third period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The fourth period (\(n=4\)) starts at potassium, and the added electrons fill up the 4s orbital. Now you may note that before the 4\(p\) orbital is filled, filling up of 3\(d\) orbitals becomes energetically favourable and we come across the so called 3\(d\)**transition series** of elements. This starts from scandium (\(Z=21\)) which has the electronic configuration 3\(d^{1}4s^{2}\). The 3\(d\) orbitals are filled at zinc (\(Z\)=30) with electronic configuration 3\(d^{10}4s^{2}\). The fourth period ends at krypton with the filling up of the 4\(p\) orbitals. Altogether we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth period (\(n=5\)) beginning with rubidium is similar to the fourth period and contains the 4\(d\)**transition series** starting at yttrium (\(Z=39\)). This period ends at xenon with the filling up of the 5\(p\) orbitals. The sixth period (\(n=6\)) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6s, 4\(f\), 5\(d\) and 6\(p\) orbitals, in the order -- filling up of the 4\(f\) orbitals begins with cerium (\(Z=58\)) and ends at lutetium (\(Z=71\)) to give the 4\(f\)**-inner transition series** which is called the **lanthanoid series**. The seventh period (\(n=7\)) is similar to the sixth period with the successive filling up of the 7s, 5\(f\), 6\(d\) and 7\(p\) orbitals and includes most of the man-made radioactive elements. This period will end at the element with atomic number 1 18 which would belong to the noble gas family. Filling up of the 5\(f\) orbitals after actinium (\(Z=89\)) gives the 5\(f\)**-inner transition series** known as the **actionoid series**. The 4_f_- and 5_f_-**inner transition series** of elements are placed separately in the Periodic Table to maintain its structure and to preserve the principle of classification by keeping elements with similar properties in a single column.

**Problem 3.2**

How would you justify the presence of 18 elements in the 5\({}^{\text{th}}\) period of the Periodic Table?

**Solution**

When \(n=5\), \(l=0\), 1, 2, 3. The order in which the energy of the available orbitals 4\(d\), 5s and 5p increases is 5s < 4\(d\) < 5p. The total number of orbitals available are 9. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated is 18; and therefore 18 elements are there in the 5\({}^{\text{th}}\) period.

_Groupwise Electronic Configurations_

Elements in the same vertical column or group have similar valence shell electronic configurations, the same number of electrons in the outer orbitals, and similar properties. For example, the Group 1 elements (alkali metals) all have \(ns^{1}\) valence shell electronic configuration as shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Atomic number** & **Symbol** & **Electronic configuration** \\ \hline
3 & Li & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{1}\)**(or)** [He]2s\({}^{1}\) \\
11 & Na & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{1}\)**(or)** [Ne]3s\({}^{1}\) \\
19 & K & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)4s\({}^{1}\)**(or)** [Ar]4s\({}^{1}\) \\
37 & Rb & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{2}\)4p\({}^{6}\)5s\({}^{1}\)**(or)** [Kr]5s\({}^{1}\) \\
55 & Cs & 1s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{3}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{2}\)4p\({}^{6}\)4d\({}^{10}\)5s\({}^{2}\)5p\({}^{6}\)6s\({}^{1}\)**(or)** [Xe]6s\({}^{1}\) \\
87 & Fr & [Rn]7s\({}^{1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Thus it can be seen that the properties of an element have periodic dependence upon its atomic number and not on relative atomic mass.

3.6 ELECTRONIC CONFIGurations AND TYPES OF ELEMENTS: _s-, p-, d-, f-BLOCKS_

The _aufbau_ (build up) principle and the electronic configuration of atoms provide a theoretical foundation for the periodic classification. The elements in a vertical column of the Periodic Table constitute a group or family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. This similarity arises because these elements have the same number and same distribution of electrons in their outermost orbitals. We can classify the elements into four blocks _viz._, _s-block_, _p-block_, _d-block_ and _f-block_ depending on the type of atomic orbitals that are being filled with electrons. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. We notice two exceptions to this categorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the _s-_block but its positioning in the _p-_block along with other group 18 elements is justified because it has a completely filled valence shell (1s\({}^{2}\)) and as a result, exhibits properties characteristic of other noble gases. The other exception is hydrogen. It has a lone s-electron and hence can be placed in group 1 (alkali metals). It can also gain an electron to achieve a noble gas arrangement and hence it can behave similar to a group 17 (halogen family) elements. Because it is a special case, we shall place hydrogen separately at the top of the Periodic Table as shown in Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3. We will briefly discuss the salient features of the four types of elements marked in the Periodic Table. More about these elements will be discussed later. During the description of their features certain terminology has been used which has been classified in section 3.7.

#### The s-Block Elements

The elements of Group 1 (alkali metals) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals) which have \(ns^{1}\)and \(ns^{2}\) outermost electronic configuration belong to the \(s\)-Block Elements. They are all reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies. They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to form 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ ion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The metallic character and the reactivity increase as we go down the group. Because of high reactivity they are never found pure in nature. The compounds of the \(s\) block elements, with the exception of those of lithium and beryllium are predominantly ionic.

#### 3.6.2 The \(p\)-Block Elements

The \(p\)-Block Elements comprise those belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these together with the \(s\)-Block Elements are called the **Representative Elements or Main Group Elements**. The outermost electronic configuration varies from \(ns^{2}np^{1}\) to \(ns^{2}np^{6}\) in each period. At the end of each period is a noble gas element with a closed valence shell \(ns^{2}np^{6}\) configuration. All the orbitals in the valence shell of the **noble gases** are completely filled by electrons and it is very difficult to alter this stable arrangement by the addition or removal of electrons. The noble gases thus exhibit very low chemical reactivity. Preceding the noble gas family are two chemically important groups of non-metals. They are the **halogens** (Group 17) and the **chalcogenas** (Group 16). These two groups of elements have high negative electron gain enthalpies and readily add one or two electrons respectively to attain the stable noble gas configuration. The non-metallic character increases as we move from left to right across a period and metallic character increases as we go down the group.

#### 3.6.3 The \(d\)-Block Elements (Transition Elements)

These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the centre of the Periodic Table. These are characterised by the filling of inner \(d\) orbitals by electrons and are therefore referred to as \(d\)-Block Elements. These elements have the general outer electronic configuration (\(n\) 1)\(d^{10}ns^{2}\). They are all metals. They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg which have the electronic configuration, (\(n\) 1) \(d^{10}ns^{2}\) do not show most of the properties of transition elements. In a way, transition metals form a bridge between the chemically active metals of \(s\) block elements and the less active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and thus take their familiar name "Transition Elements".

#### 3.6.4 The \(f\)-Block Elements

(Inner-Transition Elements)

The two rows of elements at the bottom of the Periodic Table, called the **Lanthanoids**, Ce(\(Z\) = 58) - Lu(\(Z\) = 71) and **Actioids**, Th(\(Z\) = 90) - Lu(\(Z\) = 103) are characterised by the outer electronic configuration (\(n\)-2)\(f^{1\cdot 14}\)\((n\)-1)\(d^{0-1}ns^{2}\). The last electron added to each element is filled in \(f\) orbital. These two series of elements are hence called the **Inner-Transition Elements (\(f\)-Block Elements)**. They are all metals. Within each series, the properties of the elements are quite similar. The chemistry of the early actinoids is more complicated than the corresponding lanthanoids, due to the large number of oxidation states possible for these actinoid elements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. Many of the actinoid elements have been made only in nanogram quantities or even less by nuclear reactions and their chemistry is not fully studied. The elements after uranium are called **Trans uranium Elements**.

**Problem 3.3**

The elements \(Z\) = 117 and 120 have not yet been discovered. In which family / group would you place these elements and also give the electronic configuration in each case.

**Solution**

We see from Fig. 3.2, that element with \(Z\) = 117, would belong to the halogen family (Group 17) and the electronic configuration would be [Rn] 5\(f^{14}6d^{10}7s^{7}7p^{5}\). The element with \(Z\) = 120, will be placed in Group 2 (alkaline earth metals), and will have the electronic configuration [Uuo]8s\({}^{2}\).

#### 3.6.5 Metals, Non-metals and Metalloids

In addition to displaying the classification of elements into _s-_, _p-_, _d-_, and _fblocks_, Fig. 3.3 shows another broad classification of elements based on their properties. The elements can be divided into **Metals** and **Non-Metals**. Metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on the left side of the **Periodic Table**. Metals are usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also have very low melting points (303K and 302K, respectively]). Metals usually have high melting and boiling points. They are good conductors of heat and electricity. They are malleable (can be flattened into thin sheets by hammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at the top right hand side of the **Periodic Table**. In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to non-metallic on the right. Non-metals are usually solids or gases at room temperature with low melting and boiling points (boron and carbon are exception s). They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. Most non-metallic solids are brittle and are neither malleable nor ductile. The elements become more metallic as we go down a group; the non-metallic character increases as one goes from left to right across the **Periodic Table**. The change from metallic to non-metallic character is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag line in Fig. 3.3. The elements (e.g., silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium) bordering this line and running diagonally across the **Periodic Table** show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are called **Semi-metals** or **Metalloids**.

**Problem 3.4**

Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange the following elements in the increasing order of metallic character : Si, Be, Mg, Na, P.

**Solution**

Metallic character increases down a group and decreases along a period as we move from left to right. Hence the order of increasing metallic character is: P < Si < Be < Mg < Na.

### 3.7 Periodic TRENDS IN PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTS

There are many observable patterns in the physical and chemical properties of elements as we descend in a group or move across a period in the Periodic Table. For example, within a period, chemical reactivity tends to be high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements towards the middle of the table, and increases to a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. Likewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases on moving down the group, whereas within a group of non-metals (say halogen s), reactivity decreases down the group. But why do the properties of elements follow these trends?And how can we explain periodicity? To answer these questions, we must look into the theories of atomic structure and properties of the atom. In this section we shall discuss the periodic trends in certain physical and chemical properties and try to explain them in terms of number of electrons and energy levels.

#### 3.7.1 Trends in Physical Properties

There are numerous physical properties of elements such as melting and boiling points, heats of fusion and vaporization. energy of atomization, etc. which show periodic variations. However, we shall discuss the periodic trends with respect to atomic and ionic radii. ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity.

_(a) Atomic Radius_

You can very well imagine that finding the size of an atom is a lot more complicated than measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know why? Firstly, because the size of an atom (~1.2 A i.e., 1.2 10-10 m in radius) is very small. Secondly, since the electron cloud surrounding the atom does not have a sharp boundary, the determination of the atomic size cannot be precise. In other words, there is nopractical way by which the size of an individual atom can be measured. However, an estimate of the atomic size can be made by knowing the distance between the atoms in the combined state. One practical approach to estimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic element is to measure the distance between two atoms when they are bound together by a single bond in a covalent molecule and from this value, the "**Covalent Radius**" of the element can be calculated. For example, the bond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl\({}_{\text{J}}\)) is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is taken as the atomic radius of chlorine. For metals, we define the term "**Metallic Radius**" which is taken as half the internuclear distance separating the metal cores in the metallic crystal. For example, the distance between two adjacent copper atoms in solid copper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius of copper is assigned a value of 128 pm. For simplicity, in this book, we use the term **Atomic Radius** to refer to both covalent or metallic radius depending on whether the element is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic radii can be measured by \(X\)-ray or other spectroscopic methods.

The atomic radii of a few elements are listed in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge and energy level. The atomic size generally decreases across a period as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(a) for the elements of the second period. It is because within the period the outer electrons are in the same valence shell and the effective nuclear charge increases as the atomic number increases resulting in the increased attraction of electrons to the nucleus. Within a family or vertical column of the **periodic table**, the atomic radius increases regularly with atomic number as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(b). For alkalimetals and halogens, as we descend the groups, the principal quantum number (\(n\)) increases and the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. This happens because the inner energy levels are filled with electrons, which serve to shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of the atom increases as reflected in the atomic radii.

Note that the atomic radii of noble gases are not considered here. Being monoatomic, their (non-bonded radii) values are very large. In fact radii of noble gases should be compared not with the covalent radii but with the van der Waals radii of other elements.

Table 3.6(a) Atomic Radii/pm Across the Periods

### 3.4.1 Ionic Radius

The removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a **cation**, whereas gain of an electron leads to an **anion**. The ionic radii can be estimated by measuring the distances between cations and anions in ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii of elements exhibit the same trend as the atomic radii. A cation is smaller than its parent atom because it has fewer electrons while its nuclear charge remains the same. The size of an anion will be larger than that of the parent atom because the addition of one or more electron's would result in increased repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in effective nuclear charge. For example, the ionic radius of fluoride ion (F ) is 136 pm whereas the atomic radius of fluorine is only 72 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius of sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic radius of 95 pm for Na\({}^{*}\).

When we find some atoms and ions which contain the same number of electrons, we call them **isoelectronic species**. For example, O\({}^{2-}\), F\({}^{*}\), Na\({}^{*}\) and Mg\({}^{*}\) have the same number of electrons (10). Their radii would be different because of their different nuclear charges. The cation with the greater positive charge will have a smaller radius because of the greater attraction of the electrons to the nucleus. Anion with the greater negative charge will have the larger radius. In this case, the net repulsion of the electrons will outweigh the nuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.

**Problem 3.5**

Which of the following species will have the largest and the smallest size?

Mg. Mg\({}^{2+}\), Al, Al\({}^{*}\).

### Solution

Atomic radii decrease across a period. Cations are smaller than their parent atoms. Among isoelectronic species, the one with the larger positive nuclear charge will have a smaller radius.

Hence the largest species is Mg; the smallest one is Al\({}^{*}\).

### 3.4.1 Ionization Enthalpy

A quantitative measure of the tendency of an element to lose electron is given by its **Ionization Enthalpy**. It represents the energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom (K) in its ground state. In other words, the first ionization enthalpy for an

Figure 3.4.1: Variation of atomic radius with atomic number across the second periodelement X is the enthalpy change (\(\Delta\),\(H\)) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.

\[X(g)\to X^{+}(g)+e \tag{3.1}\]

The ionization enthalpy is expressed in units of kJ mol-1. We can define the second ionization enthalpy as the energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron; it is the energy required to carry out the reaction shown in equation 3.2.

\[X^{+}(g)\to X^{2+}(g)+e \tag{3.2}\]

Energy is always required to remove electrons from an atom and hence ionization enthalpies are always positive. The second ionization enthalpy will be higher than the first ionization enthalpy because it is more difficult to remove an electron from a positively charged ion than from a neutral atom. In the same way the third ionization enthalpy will be higher than the second and so on. The term "ionization enthalpy", if not qualified, is taken as the first ionization enthalpy.

The first ionization enthalpies of elements having atomic numbers up to 60 are plotted in Fig. 3.5. The periodicity of the graph is quite striking. You will find maxima at the noble gases which have closed electron shells and very stable electron configurations. On the other hand, minima occur at the alkali metals and their low ionization enthalpies can be correlated with their high reactivity. In addition, you will notice two trends the first ionization enthalpy generally increases as we go across a period and decreases as we descend in a group. These trends are illustrated in Figs. 3.6(a) and 3.6(b) respectively for the elements of the second period and the first group of the periodic table. You will appreciate that the ionization enthalpy and atomic radius are closely related properties. To understand these trends, we have to consider two factors : (i) the attraction of electrons towards the nucleus, and (ii) the repulsion of electrons from each other. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence electron in an atom will be less than

Figure 3.5: Variation of first ionization enthalpies (\(\Delta\),\(H\)) with atomic number for elements with Z = 1 to 60

Figure 3.6: (a) First ionization enthalpies (\(\Delta\),\(H\)) of elements of the second period as a function of atomic number (Z) and Fig. 3.6(b) \(\Delta\),\(H\) of alkali metals as a function of Z.

the actual charge on the nucleus because of "shielding" or "screening" of the valence electron from the nucleus by the intervening core electrons. For example, the 2s electron in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by the inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the valence electron experiences a net positive charge which is less than the actual charge of +3. In general, shielding is effective when the orbitals in the inner shells are completely filled. This situation occurs in the case of alkali metals which have a lone \(n\)s-outermost electron preceded by a noble gas electronic configuration.

When we move from lithium to fluorine across the second period, successive electrons are added to orbitals in the same principal quantum level and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner core of electrons does not increase very much to compensate for the increased attraction of the electron to the nucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing nuclear charge outweighs the shielding. Consequently, the outermost electrons are held more and more tightly and the ionization enthalpy increases across a period. As we go down a group, the outermost electron being increasingly farther from the nucleus, there is an increased shielding of the nuclear charge by the electrons in the inner levels. In this case, in case in shielding outweighs the increasing nuclear charge and the removal of the outermost electron requires less energy down a group.

From Fig. 3.6(a), you will also notice that the first ionization enthalpy of boron (\(Z=5\)) is slightly less than that of beryllium (\(Z=4\)) even though the former has a greater nuclear charge. When we consider the same principal quantum level, an \(s\)-electron is attracted to the nucleus more than a \(p\)-electron. In beryllium, the electron removed during the ionization is an \(s\)-electron whereas the electron removed during ionization of boron is a \(p\)-electron. The penetration of a 2s electron to the nucleus is more than that of a 2\(p\) electron; hence the 2\(p\) electron of boron is more shielded from the nucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is easier to remove the 2\(p\)-electron from boron compared to the removal of a 2s electron from beryllium. Thus, boron has a smaller first ionization enthalpy than beryllium. Another "anomaly" is the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This arises because in the nitrogen atom, three 2\(p\) electrons reside in different atomic orbitals (Hund's rule) whereas in the oxygen atom, two of the four 2\(p\) electrons must occupy the same 2\(p\) orbital resulting in an increased electron-electron repulsion. Consequently, it is easier to remove the fourth 2\(p\)-electron from oxygen than it is, to remove one of the three 2\(p\)-electrons from nitrogen.

**Problem 3.6**

The first ionization enthalpy (\(\Delta H\)) values of the third period elements, Na, Mg and Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ mol-1. Predict whether the first \(\Delta H\) value for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ mol-1? Justify your answer.

**Solution**

It will be more close to 575 kJ mol-1. The value for Al should be lower than that of Mg because of effective shielding of 3\(p\) electrons from the nucleus by 3s-electrons.

**(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy**

When an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative ion, the enthalpy change accompanying the process is defined as the **Electron Gain Enthalpy** (\(\Delta_{g}H\)). Electron gain enthalpy provides a measure of the ease with which an atom adds an electron to form anion as represented by equation 3.3.

\[\textbf{X(g)}+\textbf{e^{-}}\rightarrow\textbf{X}\textbf{ (g)} \tag{3.3}\]

Depending on the element, the process of adding an electron to the atom can be either endothermic or exothermic. For many elements energy is released when an electron is added to the atom and the electron gain enthalpy is negative. For example, group 17 elements (the halogens) have very high negative electron gain enthalpies because they can attain stable noble gas electronic configurations by picking up an electron. On the other hand, noble gases have large positive electron gain enthalpies because the electron has to enter the next higher principal quantum level leading to a very unstable electronic configuration. It may be noted that electron gain enthalpies have large negative values toward the upper right of the periodic table preceding the noble gases.

The variation in electron gain enthalpies of elements is less systematic than for ionization enthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain enthalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period. The effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across a period and consequently it will be easier to add an electron to a smaller atom since the added electron on an average would be closer to the positively charged nucleus. We should also expect electron gain enthalpy to become less negative as we go down a group because the size of the atom increases and the added electron would be farther from the nucleus. This is generally the case (Table 3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or F is less than that of the succeeding element. This is because when an electron is added to O or F, the added electron goes to the smaller \(n=2\) quantum level and suffers significant repulsion from the other electrons present in this level. For the \(n=3\) quantum level (S or Cl), the added electron occupies a larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsion is much less.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Group 1** & \(\Delta_{eg}H\) & **Group 16** & \(\Delta_{eg}H\) & **Group 17** & \(\Delta_{eg}H\) & **Group 0** & \(\Delta_{eg}H\) \\ \hline

**Problem 3.7**

Which of the following will have the most negative electron gain enthalpy and which the least negative?

P, S, Cl, F.

**Explain your answer.**

**Solution**

Electron gain enthalpy generally becomes more negative across a period as we move from left to right. Within a group, electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative down a group. However, adding an electron to the \(2p\) orbital leads to greater repulsion than adding an electron to the larger \(3p\) orbital. Hence the element with most negative electron gain enthalpy is chlorine; the one with the least negative electron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.

_(e) Electronegativity_

A qualitative measure of the ability of an atom in a **chemical compound** to attract shared electrons to itself is called **electronegativity**. Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity. However, a number of numerical scales of electronegativity of elements viz., Pauling scale. Mulliken-Jaffe scale,Alred-Rochow scale have been developed. The one which is the most

#### 3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactivity

We have observed the periodic trends in certain fundamental properties such as atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and valence. We know by now that the periodicity is related to electronic configuration. That is, all chemical and physical properties are a manifestation of the electronic configuration of elements. We shall now try to explore relationships between these fundamental properties of elements with their chemical reactivity.

The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies generally increase (with some exceptions as outlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain enthalpies become more negative across a period. In other words, the ionization enthalpy of the extreme left element in a period is the least and the electron gain enthalpy of the element on the extreme right is the highest negative (note : noble gases having completely filled shells have rather positive electron gain enthalpy values). This results into high chemical reactivity at the two extremes and the lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum chemical reactivity at the extreme left (among alkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an electron leading to the formation of a cation and at the extreme right (among halogens) shown by the gain of an electron forming an anion. This property can be related with the reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the elements which you will learn later. However, here it can be directly related to the metallic and non-metallic character of elements. Thus, the metallic character of an element, which is highest at the extremely left decreases and the non-metallic character increases while moving from left to right across the period. The chemical reactivity of an element can be best shown by its reactions with oxygen and halogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction of the elements with oxygen only. Elements on two extremes of a period easily combine with oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide formed by the element on extreme left is the most basic (e.g., Na2O), whereas that formed by the element on extreme right is the most acidic (e.g., Cl2O). Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides behave as acidic with bases and as basic with acids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic or basic properties.

**Problem 3.10**

Show by a chemical reaction with water that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O, is an acidic oxide.

**Solution**

Na2O with water forms a strong base whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.

**Na2O + H2O 2NaOH**

**Cl2O7 + H2O 2HClO4**

Their basic or acidic nature can be qualitatively tested with litmus paper.

Among transition metals (3_d_series), the change in atomic radii is much smaller as compared to those of representative elements across the period. The change in atomic radii is still smaller among inner-transition metals (4\(f\) series). The ionization enthalpies are intermediate between those of s and \(p\) blocks. As a consequence, they are less electropositive than group 1 and 2 metals.

In a group, the increase in atomic and ionic radii with increase in atomic number generally results in a gradual decrease in ionization enthalpies and a regular decrease (with exception in some third period elements as shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron gain enthalpies in the case of main group elements.

Thus, the metallic character increases down the group and non-metallic character decreases. This trend can be related with their reducing and oxidizing property which you will learn later. In the case of transition elements, however, a reverse trend is observed. This can be explained in terms of atomic size and ionization enthalpy.

## Summary

In this Unit, you have studied the development of the **Periodic Law** and the **Periodic Table**. **Mendeleev's **Periodic Table** was based on atomic masses. Modern **Periodic Table** arranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (**periods**) and eighteen vertical columns (**groups** or **families**). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar **valence shell** electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties. However, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are **_s-block_**, **_p-block_**, **_d-block_** and **_f-block_** elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic table. **Metals** comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. **Non-metals**, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called **metalloids** or **semi-metals**. Metallic character increases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right in a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their atomic numbers.

**Periodic trends** are observed in **atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain enthalpies, electronegativity** and **valence**. The atomic radii decrease while going from left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. **Chemical reactivity** is highest at the two extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.

## Chapter 4 Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

### 4.1 Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

1.1 Scientificists are constantly discovering new compounds, orderly arranging the facts about them, trying to explain with the existing knowledge, organising to modify the earlier views or evolve theories for explaining the newly observed facts

1.2 Matter is made up of one or different type of elements. Under normal conditions no other element exists as an independent atom in nature, except noble gases. However, a group of atoms is found to exist together as one species having characteristic properties. Such a group of atoms is called a molecule. Obviously there must be some force which holds these constituent atoms together in the molecules. **The attractive force which holds various constituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different chemical species is called a chemical bond.** Since the formation of chemical compounds takes place as a result of combination of atoms of various elements in different ways, it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine? Why are only certain combinations possible? Why do some atoms combine while certain others do not? Why do molecules possess definite shapes? To answer such questions different theories and concepts have been put forward from time to time. These are Kossel-Lewis approach, Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory, Valence Bond (VB) Theory and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The evolution of various theories of valence and the interpretation of the nature of chemical bonds have closely been related to the developments in the understanding of the structure of atom, the electronic configuration of elements and the periodic table. Every system tends to be more stable and bonding is nature's way of lowering the energy of the system to attain stability.

### 4.1 Kosssel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding

In order to explain the formation of chemical bond in terms of electrons, a number of attempts were made, but it was only in 1916 when Kossel and Lewis succeeded independently in giving a satisfactory explanation. They were the first to provide some logical explanation of valence which was based on the inertness of noble gases.

Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a positively charged 'Kernel' (the nucleus plus the inner electrons) and the outer shell that could accommodate a maximum of eight electrons. He, further assumed that these eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube which surround the 'Kernel'. Thus the single outer shell electron of sodium would occupy one corner of the cube, while in the case of a noble gas all the eight corners would be occupied. This octet of electrons, represents a particularly stable electronic arrangement. **Lewis postulated that atoms achieve the stable octet when they are linked by chemical bonds.** In the case of sodium and chlorine, this can happen by the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine thereby giving the Na\({}^{+}\) and C1 ions. In the case of other molecules like Cl\({}_{2}\), H\({}_{2}\), F\({}_{2}\), etc., the bond is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons between the atoms. In the process each atom attains a **stable outer octet of electrons**.

_Lewis Symbols:_ In the formation of a molecule, only the outer shell electrons take part in chemical combination and they are known as **valence electrons**. The inner shell electrons are well protected and are generally not involved in the combination process. G.N. Lewis, an American chemist introduced simple notations to represent valence electrons in an atom. These notations are called **Lewis symbols**. For example, the Lewis symbols for the elements of second period are as under:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Li Be & B & C & N & O & F & Ne \\ \end{tabular}

_Significance of Lewis Symbols :_ The number of dots around the symbol represents the number of valence electrons. This number of valence electrons helps to calculate the common or **group valence** of the element. The group valence of the elements is generally either equal to the number of dots in Lewis symbols or 8 minus the number of dots or valence electrons.

**Kossel, in relation to chemical bonding, drew attention to the following facts:**

* In the periodic table, the highly electronegative halogens and the highly electropositive alkali metals are separated by the noble gases:
* The formation of a negative ion from a halogen atom and a positive ion from an alkali metal atom is associated with the gain and loss of an electron by the respective atoms:
* The negative and positive ions thus formed attain stable noble gas electronic configurations. The noble gases (with the exception of helium which has a duplet of electrons) have a particularly stable outer shell configuration of eight (octet) electrons, \(ns^{2}np^{6}\).
* The negative and positive ions are stabilized by electrostatic attraction.

For example, the formation of NaCl from sodium and chlorine, according to the above scheme, can be explained as:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Na & \(\rightarrow\) & Na\({}^{+}\) + e \\ [Ne] 3s\({}^{1}\) & & [Ne] \\ Cl + e & \(\rightarrow\) & C1 \\ [Ne] 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{5}\) & & [Ne] 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) or [Ar] \\ Na\({}^{+}\) + C1 & \(\rightarrow\) & NaCl or Na\({}^{+}\)Cl \\ \end{tabular}

Similarly the formation of CaF\({}_{2}\) may be shown as:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Ca & \(\rightarrow\) & Ca\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \\ [Ar]4s\({}^{2}\) & & [Ar] \\ F + e & \(\rightarrow\) & F \\ [He] 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{5}\) & [He] 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) or [Ne] \\ Ca\({}^{2+}\) + 2F & \(\rightarrow\) & CaF\({}_{2}\) or Ca\({}^{2+}\)(F )\({}_{2}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**The bond formed, as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the positive and negative ions was termed asthe electrovalent bond. The electrovalence is thus equal to the number of unit charge(s) on the ion. Thus, calcium is assigned a positive electrovalence of two, while chlorine a negative electrovalence of one.

Kossel's postulations provide the basis for the modern concepts regarding ion-formation by electron transfer and the formation of ionic crystalline compounds. His views have proved to be of great value in the understanding and systematisation of the ionic compounds. At the same time he did recognise the fact that a large number of compounds did not fit into these concepts.

4.1.1 Octet Rule

Kossel and Lewis in 1916 developed an important theory of chemical combination between atoms known as **electronic theory of chemical bonding**. According to this, atoms can combine either by transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence electrons in order to have an octet in their valence shells. This is known as **octet rule**.

4.1.2 Covalent Bond

Langmuir (1919) refined the Lewis postulations by abandoning the idea of the stationary cubical arrangement of the octet, and by introducing the term **covalent bond**. The Lewis-Langmuir theory can be understood by considering the formation of the chlorine molecule,Cl\({}_{2}\). The Cl atom with electronic configuration, [Ne]3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{5}\), is one electron short of the argon configuration. The formation of the Cl\({}_{2}\) molecule can be understood in terms of the sharing of a pair of electrons between the two chlorine atoms, each chlorine atom contributing one electron to the shared pair. In the process both chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of the nearest noble gas (i.e., argon).

The dots represent electrons. Such structures are referred to as Lewis dot structures.

The Lewis dot structures can be written for other molecules also, in which the combining atoms may be identical or different. The important conditions being that:

* Each bond is formed as a result of sharing of an electron pair between the atoms.
* Each combining atom contributes at least one electron to the shared pair.
* The combining atoms attain the outer-shell noble gas configurations as a result of the sharing of electrons.
* Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride molecules, formation of covalent bonds can be represented as:

Thus, when two atoms share one electron pair they are said to be joined by a single covalent bond. In many compounds we have multiple bonds between atoms. The formation of multiple bonds envisages sharing of more than one electron pair between two atoms. If two atoms share two pairs of electrons, the covalent bond between them is called a double bond. For example, in the carbon dioxide molecule, we have two double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms. Similarly in ethene molecule the two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond.

in subtraction of one electron from the total number of valence electrons. For example, for the CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\) ion, the two negative charges indicate that there are two additional electrons than those provided by the neutral atoms. For NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ion, one positive charge indicates the loss of one electron from the group of neutral atoms.
* Knowing the chemical symbols of the combining atoms and having knowledge of the skeletal structure of the compound (known or guessed intelligently), it is easy to distribute the total number of electrons as bonding shared pairs between the atoms in proportion to the total bonds.
* In general the least electronegative atom occupies the central position in the molecule/ion. For example in the NF\({}_{3}\) and CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\), nitrogen and carbon are the central atoms whereas fluorine and oxygen occupy the terminal positions.
* After accounting for the shared pairs of electrons for single bonds, the remaining electron pairs are either utilized for multiple bonding or remain as the lone pairs. The basic requirement being that each bonded atom gets an octet of electrons. Lewis representations of a few molecules/ions are given in Table 4.1.

**Problem 4.1**: Write the Lewis dot structure of CO molecule.
**Solution**

**Step 1.** Count the total number of valence electrons of carbon and oxygen atoms. The outer (valence) shell configurations of carbon and oxygen atoms are: 2s\({}^{2}\) 2\(p^{2}\) and 2s\({}^{2}\) 2\(p^{4}\), respectively. The valence electrons available are 4 + 6 = 10.
**Step 2.** The skeletal structure of CO is written as: CO
**Step 3.** Draw a single bond (one shared electron pair) between C and O and complete the octet on O, the remaining two electrons are the lone pair on C.

This does not complete the octet on carbon and hence we have to resort to multiple bonding (in this case a triple bond) between C and O atoms. This satisfies the octet rule condition for both atoms.

**Problem 4.2**: Write the Lewis structure of the nitrite ion, NO\({}_{2}^{*}\).
**Solution**

**Step 1.** Count the total number of valence electrons of the nitrogen atom, the oxygen atoms and the additional one negative charge (equal to one electron). N(2s\({}^{2}\) 2\(p^{3}\)), O (2s\({}^{2}\) 2\(p^{4}\))

**Step 2.** The skeletal structure of NO\({}_{2}^{*}\) is written as : O N O
**Step 3.** Draw a single bond (one shared electron pair) between the nitrogen and each of the oxygen atoms completing the octets on oxygen atoms. This, however, does not complete the octet on nitrogen if the remaining two electrons constitute lone pair on it.

Hence we have to resort to multiple bonding between nitrogen and one of the oxygen atoms (in this case a double bond). This leads to the following Lewis dot structures.

**4.1.4**: Formal Charge

Lewis dot structures, in general, do not represent the actual shapes of the molecules. In case of polyatomic ions, the net charge is possessed by the ion as a whole and not by a particular atom. It is, however, feasible to assign a formal charge on each atom. The formal charge of an atom in a polyatomic molecule or ion may be defined as the difference between the number of valence electrons of that atom in an isolated or free state and the number of electrons assigned to that atom in the Lewis structure. It is expressed as :

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline\text{Formal charge (F.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:101]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:102]

processes is more than the energy absorbed. Thus a qualitative measure of the stability of anionic compounds is provided by its enthalpy of lattice formation and not simply by achieving octet of electrons around the ionic species in gaseous state.

Since lattice enthalpy plays a key role in the formation of ionic compounds, it is important that we learn more about it.

#### Lattice Enthalpy

The Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid is defined as the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into gaseous constituent ions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of NaCl is 788 kJ mol 1. This means that 788 kJ of energy is required to separate one mole of solid NaCl into one mole of Na+ (g) and one mole of C1 (g) to an infinite distance.

This process involves both the attractive forces between ions of opposite charges and the repulsive forces between ions of like charge. The solid crystal being three-dimensional: it is not possible to calculate lattice enthalpy directly from the interaction of forces of attraction and repulsion only. Factors associated with the crystal geometry have to be included.

#### Bond Parammeters

Bond Length is defined as the equilibrium distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms in a molecule.

Bond lengths are measured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction and electron-diffraction techniques about which you will learn in higher classes. Each atom of the bonded pair contributes to the bond length (Fig. 1). In the case of a covalent bond, the contribution from each atom is called the covalent radius of that atom.

The covalent radius is measured approximately as the radius of an atom's core which is in contact with the core of an adjacent atom in a bonded situation.

The covalent radius is half of the distance between two similar atoms joined by a covalent bond in the same molecule. **The van der Waals radius represents the overall size of the atom which includes its valence shell in a nonbonded situation.** Further, the van der Waals radius is half of the distance between two similar atoms in separate molecules in a solid. Covalent and van der Waals radii of chlorine are depicted in Fig. 2Some typical average bond lengths for single, double and triple bonds are shown in Table 4.2. Bond lengths for some common molecules are given in Table 4.3.

The covalent radii of some common elements are listed in Table 4.4.

#### 4.3.2 Bond Angle

It is defined as the angle between the orbitals containing bonding electron pairs around the central atom in a molecule/complexion. Bond angle is expressed in degree which can be experimentally determined by spectroscopic methods. It gives some idea regarding the distribution of orbitals around the central atom in a molecule/complexion and hence it helps us in determining its shape. For example H-O-H bond angle in water can be represented as under :

#### 4.3.3 Bond Enthalpy

It is defined as the amount of energy required to break one mole of bonds of a particular type between two atoms in a gaseous state. The unit of bond enthalpy is kJ mol\({}^{1}\). For example, the H - H bond enthalpy in hydrogen molecule is 435.8 kJ mol\({}^{1}\).

H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) H(g) + H(g): \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{\text{r}}=435.8\) kJ mol\({}^{1}\)

Similarly the bond enthalpy for molecules containing multiple bonds, for example O\({}_{2}\) and N\({}_{2}\) will be as under :

O\({}_{2}\) (O = O) (g) \(\rightarrow\) O(g) + O(g):

\(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{\text{r}}=498\) kJ mol\({}^{1}\)

N\({}_{2}\) (N = N) (g) \(\rightarrow\) N(g) + N(g):

\(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{\text{r}}=946.0\) kJ mol\({}^{1}\)

It is important that larger the bond dissociation enthalpy, stronger will be the bond in the molecule. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecules like HCl, we have

HC1 (g) \(\rightarrow\) H(g) + Cl (g): \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{\text{r}}=431.0\) kJ mol\({}^{1}\)

In case of polyatomic molecules, the measurement of bond strength is more complicated. For example in case of H\({}_{2}\)O molecule, the enthalpy needed to break the two O - H bonds is not the same.

\(H_{2}\)O(g) \(\rightarrow\) H(g) + OH(g); \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H_{1}^{{}^{\prime}}=502\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) OH(g) \(\rightarrow\) H(g) + O(g); \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H_{2}^{{}^{\prime}}=427\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The difference in the \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{{}^{\prime}}\) value shows that the second O - H bond undergoes some change because of changed chemical environment. This is the reason for some difference in energy of the same O - H bond in different molecules like C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH (ethanol) and water. Therefore in polyatomic molecules the term **mean or average bond enthalpy** is used. It is obtained by dividing total bond dissociation enthalpy by the number of bonds broken as explained below in case of water molecule.

\[\text{Average bond enthalpy} =\frac{\cdot}{502+427}\] \[=464,5\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

#### 4.3.4 Bond Order

**In the Lewis description of covalent bond, the Bond Order is given by the number of bonds between the two atoms in a molecule.** The bond order, for example in H\({}_{2}\) (with a single shared electron pair), in O\({}_{2}\) (with two shared electron pairs) and in N\({}_{2}\) (with three shared electron pairs) is 1,2,3 respectively. Similarly in CO (three shared electron pairs between C and O) the bond order is 3. For N\({}_{2}\), bond order is 3 and its \(\Delta_{\text{a}}H^{\text{v}}\) is 946 kJ mol 1; being one of the highest for a diatomic molecule.

**Isoelectronic molecules and ions have identical bond orders; for example, F\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}^{2-}\) have bond order 1. N\({}_{2}\), CO and NO\({}^{+}\) have bond order 3.**

**A general correlation useful for understanding the stabilities of molecules is that: with increase in bond order, bond enthalpy increases and bond length decreases.**

#### 4.3.5 Resonance Structures

It is often observed that a single Lewis structure is inadequate for the representation of a molecule in conformity with its experimentally determined parameters. For example, the ozone, O\({}_{3}\) molecule can be equally represented by the structures I and II shown below:

In both structures we have a O-O single bond and a O-O double bond. The normal O-O and O=O bond lengths are 148 pm and 121 pm respectively. Experimentally determined oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in the O\({}_{3}\) molecule are same (128 pm). Thus the oxygen-oxygen bonds in the O\({}_{3}\) molecule are intermediate between a double and a single bond. Obviously, this cannot be represented by either of the two Lewis structures shown above.

The concept of resonance was introduced to deal with the type of difficulty experienced in the depiction of accurate structures of molecules like O\({}_{3}\). **According to the concept of resonance, whenever a single Lewis structure cannot describe a molecule accurately, a number of structures with similar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding and non-bonding pairs of electrons are taken as the canonical structures of the hybrid which describes the molecule accurately.** Thus for O\({}_{3}\), the two structures shown above constitute the canonical structures or resonance structures and their hybrid i.e., the III structure represents the structure of O\({}_{3}\) more accurately. This is also called **resonance hybrid**. Resonance is represented by a double headed arrow.

Figure 4.3: Resonance in the O\({}_{3}\) molecule

Some of the other examples of resonance structures are provided by the carbonate ion and the carbon dioxide molecule.

**Problem 4.3**

 Explain the structure of CO\({}_{3}^{2}\)- ion in terms of resonance.

**Solution**

 The single Lewis structure based on the presence of two single bonds and one double bond between carbon and oxygen atoms is inadequate to represent the molecule accurately as it represents unequal bonds. According to the experimental findings, all carbon to oxygen bonds in CO\({}_{3}^{2}\)- are equivalent. Therefore the carbonate ion is best described as a resonance hybrid of the canonical forms I, II, and III shown below.

**Problem 4.4**

 Explain the structure of CO\({}_{2}\) molecule. Solution

 The experimentally determined carbon to oxygen bond length in CO\({}_{2}\) is 115 pm. The lengths of a normal carbon to oxygen double bond (C=O) and carbon to oxygen triple bond (C=O) are 121 pm and 110 pm respectively. The carbon-oxygen bond lengths in CO\({}_{2}\) (115 pm) lie between the values for C=O and C=O. Obviously, a single Lewis structure cannot depict this position and it becomes necessary to write more than one Lewis structures and to consider that the structure of CO\({}_{2}\) is best described as a hybrid of the canonical or resonance forms I, II and III.

**In general, it may be stated that**

 Resonance stabilizes the molecule as the energy of the resonance hybrid is less than the energy of any single cannonical structure; and,

 Resonance averages the bond characteristics as a whole.

 Thus the energy of the O\({}_{3}\) resonance hybrid is lower than either of the two cannonical from I and II (Fig 4.3).

**Many misconceptions are associated with resonance and the same need to be dispelled. You should remember that :**

 The cannonical forms have no real existence.

 The molecule does not exist for a certain fraction of time in one cannonical form and for other fractions of time in other cannonical forms.

 There is no such equilibrium between the cannonical forms as we have between tautomeric forms (_keto_ and _enol_) in tautomerism.

 The molecule as such has a single structure which is the resonance hybrid of the cannonical forms and which cannot as such be depicted by a single Lewis structure.

#### 4.3.6 Polarity of Bonds

The existence of a hundred percent ionic or covalent bond represents an ideal situation. In reality no bond or a compound is either completely covalent or ionic. Even in case of covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms, there is some ionic character.

 When covalent bond is formed between two similar atoms, for example in H\({}_{2}\), O\({}_{2}\), Cl\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\) or F\({}_{2}\), the shared pair of electrons is equally 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:107]

the direction opposite to the resultant dipole moment of the three N-F bonds. The orbital dipole because of lone pair decreases the effect of the resultant N - F bond moments, which results in the low dipole moment of NF\({}_{3}\) as represented below :

Dipole moments of some molecules are shown in Table 4.5.

**Just as all the covalent bonds have some partial ionic character, the ionic bonds also have partial covalent character. The partial covalent character of ionic bonds was discussed by Fajans in terms of the following rules:**

The smaller the size of the cation and the larger the size of the anion, the greater the covalent character of an ionic bond.

The greater the charge on the cation, the greater the covalent character of the ionic bond.

For cations of the same size and charge, the one, with electronic configuration (\(n\)-1)d\({}^{n}\)n's\({}^{o}\), typical of transition metals, is more polarising than the one with a noble gas configuration, \(ns^{2}\)\(np^{6}\), typical of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations.

The cation polarises the anion, pulling the electronic charge toward itself and thereby increasing the electronic charge between the two. This is precisely what happens in a covalent bond, i.e., buildup of electron charge density between the nuclei. The polarising power of the cation, the polarisability of the anion and the extent of distortion (polarisation) of anion are the factors, which determine the per cent covalent character of the ionic bond.

The VALENCE SHELL ELECTRON PAIR REPUSSION (VSEPR) THEORY As already explained, Lewis concept is unable to explain the shapes of molecules. This theory provides a simple procedure to predict the shapes of covalent molecules. Sidgwickand Powell in 1940, proposed a simple theory based on the repulsive interactions of the electron pairs in the valence shell of the atoms. It was further developed and redefined by Nyholm and Gillespie (1957).

**The main postulates of VSEPR theory are as follows:**

* The shape of a molecule depends upon the number of valence shell electron pairs (bonded or nonbonded) around the central atom.
* Pairs of electrons in the valence shell repel one another since their electron clouds are negatively charged.
* These pairs of electrons tend to occupy such positions in space that minimise repulsion and thus maximise distance between them.
* The valence shell is taken as a sphere with the electron pairs localising on the spherical surface at maximum distance from one another.
* A multiple bond is treated as if it is a single electron pair and the two or three electron pairs of a multiple bond are treated as a single super pair.
* Where two or more resonance structures can represent a molecule, the VSEPR model is applicable to any such structure.

**The repulsive interaction of electron pairs decrease in the order:**

**Lone pair (lp) - Lone pair (lp) > Lone pair (lp) - Bond pair (bp) - Bond pair (bp)**

Nyholm and Gillespie (1957) refined the VSEPR model by explaining the important difference between the lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons. While the lone pairs are localised on the central atom, each bonded pair is shared between two atoms. As a result, the lone pair electrons in a molecule occupy more space as compared to the bonding pairs of electrons. This results in greater repulsion between lone pairs of electrons as compared to the lone pair - bond pair and bond pair - bond pair repulsions. These repulsion effects result in deviations from idealised shapes and alterations in bond angles in molecules.**

For the prediction of geometrical shapes of molecules with the help of VSEPR theory, it is convenient to divide molecules into two categories as **(i) molecules in which the central atom has no lone pair and **(ii) molecules in which the central atom has one or more lone pairs.**

**Table 4.6 (page110) shows the arrangement of electron pairs about a central atom A (without any lonepairs) and geometries of some molecules/ions of the type AB. Table 4.7 (page 111) shows shapes of some simple molecules and ions in which the central atom has one or more lone pairs. Table 4.8 (page 112) explains the reasons for the distortions in the geometry of the molecule.**

**As depicted in Table 4.6, in the compounds of AB, AB, AB, AB and AB, the arrangement of electron pairs and the B atoms around the central atom A are : **linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral, respectively. Such arrangement can be seen in the molecules like BF3 (AB3), CH4 (AB4) and PCI8 (AB9) as depicted below by their ball and stick models.**

**The VSEPR Theory is able to predict geometry of a large number of molecules, especially the compounds of \(p\)-block elements accurately. It is also quite successful in determining the geometry quite-accurately even when the energy difference between possible structures is very small. The theoretical basis of the VSEPR theory regarding the effects of electron pair repulsions on molecular shapes is not clear and continues to be a subject of doubt and discussion.**

### VALEENCE BOND THEORY

As we know that Lewis approach helps in writing the structure of molecules but it fails to explain the formation of chemical bond. It also does not give any reason for the difference in bond dissociation enthalpies and bond lengths in molecules like H\({}_{2}\) (435.8 kJ mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\), 74 pm) and F\({}_{2}\) (150.6 kJ mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\), 42 pm), although in both the cases a single covalent bond is formed by the sharing of an electron pair between the respective atoms. It also gives no idea about the shapes of polyatomic molecules.

Similarly the VSEPR theory gives the geometry of simple molecules but theoretically, it does not explain them and also it has limited applications. To overcome these limitations the two important theories based on quantum mechanical principles are introduced. These are valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory.

**Valence bond theory** was introduced by Heitler and London (1927) and developed further by Pauling and others. A discussion of the valence bond theory is based on the knowledge of atomic orbitals, electronic configurations of elements (Units 2), the overlap criteria of atomic orbitals, the hybridization of atomic orbitals and the principles of variation and superposition. A rigorous treatment of the VB theory in terms of these aspects is beyond the scope of this book. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, valence bond theory has been discussed in terms of qualitative and non-mathematical treatment only. To start with, let us consider the formation of hydrogen molecule which is the simplest of all molecules.

Consider two hydrogen atoms A and B approaching each other having nuclei N\({}_{A}\) and N\({}_{B}\) and electrons present in them are represented by e\({}_{A}\) and e\({}_{B}\). When the two atoms are at large distance from each other, there is no interaction between them. As these two atoms approach each other, new attractive and repulsive forces begin to operate.

Attractive forces arise between:

1. nucleus of one atom and its own electron that is N\({}_{A}-\)e\({}_{A}\) and N\({}_{B}-\)e\({}_{B}\).

* nucleus of one atom and electron of other atom i.e., \(N_{A}-e_{B}\), \(N_{B}-e_{A}\).
* Similarly repulsive forces arise between (i) electrons of two atoms like \(e_{A}-e_{B}\), (ii) nuclei of two atoms \(N_{A}-N_{B}\).

Attractive forces tend to bring the two atoms close to each other whereas repulsive forces tend to push them apart (Fig. 4.7).

Experimentally it has been found that the magnitude of new attractive force is more than the new repulsive forces. As a result, two atoms approach each other and potential energy decreases. Ultimately a stage is reached where the net force of attraction balances the force of repulsion and system acquires minimum energy. At this stage two hydrogen atoms are said to be bonded together to form a stable molecule having the bond length of 74 pm.

Since the energy gets released when the bond is formed between two hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen molecule is more stable than that of isolated hydrogen atoms. The energy so released is called as **bond enthalpy**, which is corresponding to minimum in the curve depicted in Fig. 4.8. Conversely, 435.8 kJ of energy is required to dissociate one mole of \(H_{2}\) molecule.

#### Orbital Overlap Concept

In the formation of hydrogen molecule, there is a minimum energy state when two hydrogen atoms are so near that their atomic orbitals undergo partial interpenetration. This partial merging of atomic orbitals is called overlapping of atomic orbitals which results in the pairing of electrons. The extent of overlap decides the strength of a covalent bond. In general, greater the overlap the stronger is the bond formed between two atoms. Therefore, according to orbital overlap concept, the formation of a covalent bond between two atoms results by pairing of electrons present in the valence shell having opposite spins.

Figure 4.7: Forces of attraction and repulsion during the formation of \(H_{2}\) molecule.

Figure 4.8: The potential energy curve for the formation of \(H_{2}\) molecule as a function of internucle are distance of the H atoms. The minimum in the curve corresponds to the most stable state of \(H_{2}\).

#### 4.5.2 Directional Properties of Bonds

As we have already seen the formation of covalent bond depends on the overlapping of atomic orbitals. The molecule of hydrogen is formed due to the overlap of 1s-orbitals of two H atoms, when they combine with each other.

In case of polyatomic molecules like CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O, the geometry of the molecules is also important in addition to the bond formation. For example why is it so that CH\({}_{4}\) molecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH bond angles are 109.5? Why is the shape of NH\({}_{3}\) molecule pyramidal?

The valence bond theory explains the formation and directional properties of bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O, etc. in terms of overlap and hybridisation of atomic orbitals.

#### 4.5.3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals

When two atoms come close to each other, there is overlapping of atomic orbitals. This overlap may be positive, negative or zero depending upon the properties of overlapping of atomic orbitals. The various arrangements of \(s\) and \(p\) orbitals resulting in positive, negative and zero overlap are depicted in Fig. 4.9.

The criterion of overlap, as the main factor for the formation of covalent bonds applies uniformly to the homonuclear/heteronuclear diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules. In the case of polyatomic molecules like CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O, the VB theory has to account for their characteristic shapes as well. We know that the shapes of CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\), and H\({}_{2}\)O molecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal and bent respectively. It would be therefore interesting to find out if these geometrical shapes can be explained in terms of the orbital overlaps.

Let us first consider the CH\({}_{4}\) (methane) molecule. The electronic configuration of carbon in its ground state is [He]2\(s^{2}\) 2\(p^{2}\) which in the excited state becomes [He] 2\(s^{1}\) 2\(p_{\rm x}\)\({}^{1}\) 2\(p_{\rm y}\)\({}^{1}\) 2\(p_{\rm z}\)\({}^{1}\). The energy required for this excitation is compensated by the release of energy due to overlap between the orbitals of carbon and the hydrogen.The four atomic orbitals of carbon, each with an unpaired electron can overlap with the 1\(s\) orbitals of the four H atoms which are also singly occupied. This will result in the formation of four C-H bonds. It will, however, be observed that while the three p orbitals of carbon are at 90 to one another, the HCH angle for these will also be 90. That is three C-H bonds will be oriented at 90 to one another. The 2\(s\) orbital of carbon and the 1\(s\) orbital of H are spherically symmetrical and they can overlap in any direction. Therefore the direction of the fourth C-H bond cannot be ascertained. This description does not fit in with the tetrahedral HCH angles of 109.5. Clearly, it follows that simple atomic orbital overlap does not account for the directional characteristics of bonds in CH\({}_{4}\). Using similar procedure and arguments, it can be seen that in the

Figure 4.9: Positive, negative and zero overlaps of \(s\) and \(p\) atomic orbitalscase of NH3 and H2O molecules, the HNH and HOH angles should be 90. This is in disagreement with the actual bond angles of 107 and 104.5 in the NH3 and H2O molecules respectively.

#### 4.5.4 Types of Overlapping and Nature of Covalent Bonds

The covalent bond may be classified into two types depending upon the types of overlapping:

**(i)** Sigma(\(\sigma\)) bond, and (ii) pi(\(\pi\)) bond

**(1)** **Sigma(\(\sigma\)) bond :** This type of covalent bond is formed by the end to end (hand-on) overlap of bonding orbitals along the internuclear axis. This is called as head on overlap or axial overlap. This can be formed by any one of the following types of combinations of atomic orbitals.

**\(\mathbf{s}\)-\(\mathbf{s}\) overlapping :** In this case, there is overlap of two half filled \(\mathbf{s}\)-orbitals along the internuclear axis as shown below :

\(\mathbf{s}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{s}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{s}\)-\(\mathbf{s}\) overlapping

**\(\mathbf{s}\)-\(\mathbf{p}\) overlapping :** This type of overlap occurs between half filled \(\mathbf{s}\)-orbitals of one atom and half filled \(p\)-orbitals of another atom.

\(\mathbf{s}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{p}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{s}\)-\(\mathbf{p}\) overlapping

**\(\mathbf{p}\)-\(\mathbf{p}\) overlapping :** This type of overlap takes place between half filled \(\mathbf{p}\)-orbitals of the two approaching atoms.

\(\mathbf{p}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{p}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{p}\)-\(\mathbf{p}\) overlapping

**(ii) pi(\(\pi\)) bond :** In the formation of \(\pi\) bond the atomic orbitals overlap in such a way that their axes remain parallel to each other and perpendicular to the internuclear axis. The orbitals formed due to sidewise overlapping consists of two saucer type charged clouds above and below the plane of the participating atoms.

\(\mathbf{p}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{p}\)-orbital \(\mathbf{p}\)-\(\mathbf{p}\) overlapping

#### 4.5.5 Strength of Sigma and pi Bonds

Basically the strength of a bond depends upon the extent of overlapping. In case of sigma bond, the overlapping of orbitals takes place to a larger extent. Hence, it is stronger as compared to the pi bond where the extent of overlapping occurs to a smaller extent. Further, it is important to note that pi bond between two atoms is formed in addition to a sigma bond. It is always present in the molecules containing multiple bond (double or triple bonds)

### HYBRIDISATION

In order to explain the characteristic geometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules like CH4, NH3 and H2O etc., Pauling introduced the concept of hybridisation. According to him the atomic orbitals combine to form new set of equivalent orbitals known as **hybrid orbitals**. Unlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are used in bond formation. The phenomenon is known as **hybridisation** which can be defined as the process of intermixing of the orbitals of slightly different energies so as to redistribute their energies, resulting in the formation of new set of orbitals of equivalent energies and shape. For example when one \(\mathbf{2}\mathbf{s}\) and three \(\mathbf{2}\mathbf{p}\)-orbitals of carbon hybridise, there is the formation of four new \(\mathbf{sp}^{3}\) hybrid orbitals.

_Salient features of hybridisation:_ The main features of hybridisation are as under :

1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to the number of the atomic orbitals that get hybridised.
2. The hybridised orbitals are always equivalent in energy and shape.

3. The hybrid orbitals are more effective in forming stable bonds than the pure atomic orbitals.
4. These hybrid orbitals are directed in space in some preferred direction to have minimum repulsion between electron pairs and thus a stable arrangement. Therefore, the type of hybridisation indicates the geometry of the molecules.

**Important conditions for hybridisation**

(i) The orbitals present in the valence shell of the atom are hybridised.

(ii) The orbitals undergoing hybridisation should have almost equal energy.

(iii) Promotion of electron is not essential condition prior to hybridisation.

(iv) It is not necessary that only half filled orbitals participate in hybridisation. In some cases, even filled orbitals of valence shell take part in hybridisation.

#### Types of Hybridisation

There are various types of hybridisation involving \(s\), \(p\) and \(d\) orbitals. The different types of hybridisation are as under:

**(I)** _sp hybridisation:_ This type of hybridisation involves the mixing of one \(s\) and one \(p\) orbital resulting in the formation of two equivalent \(sp\) hybrid orbitals. The suitable orbitals for \(sp\) hybridisation are \(s\) and \(p_{x}\), if the hybrid orbitals are to lie along the z-axis. Each \(sp\) hybrid orbitals has 50% s-character and 50% \(p\)-character. Such a molecule in which the central atom is \(sp\)-hybridised and linked directly to two other central atoms possesses linear geometry. This type of hybridisation is also known as diagonal hybridisation.

The two \(sp\) hybrids point in the opposite direction along the z-axis with projecting positive lobes and very small negative lobes, which provides more effective overlapping resulting in the formation of stronger bonds.

**Example of molecule having \(sp\) hybridisation**

**BeCl\({}_{2}\):** The ground state electronic configuration of Be is 1s2s2. In the exited state one of the 2s-electrons is promoted to vacant 2\(p\) orbital to account for its divalency. One 2s and one 2\(p\)-orbitals get hybridised to form two \(sp\) hybridised orbitals. These two \(sp\) hybrid orbitals are oriented in opposite direction forming an angle of 180. Each of the \(sp\) hybridised orbital overlaps with the 2\(p\)-orbital of chlorine axially and form two BeCl sigma bonds. This is shown in Fig. 10.

**(II)** _sp\({}^{2}\) hybridisation:_ In this hybridisation there is involvement of one \(s\) and two \(p\)-orbitals in order to form three equivalent \(sp^{2}\) hybridised orbitals. For example, in BCL\({}_{3}\) molecule, the ground state electronic configuration of central boron atom is 1s2s2s2p1. In the excited state, one of the 2s electrons is promoted to vacant 2\(p\) orbital as a result boron has three unpaired electrons. These three orbitals (one 2s and two 2p) hybridise to form three \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbitals. The three hybrid orbitals so formed are oriented in a trigonal planar arrangement and overlap with 2\(p\) orbitals of chlorine to form three B-C1 bonds. Therefore, in BC1\({}_{3}\) (Fig. 11), the geometry is trigonal planar with CIBC1 bond angle of 120.

**(III) \(sp^{3}\) hybridisation:** This type of hybridisation can be explained by taking the example of CH4 molecule in which there is mixing of one s-orbital and three \(p\)-orbitals of the valence shell to form four \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbital of equivalent energies and shape. There is 25% \(s\)-character and 75% \(p\)-character in each \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbital. The four \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbitals so formed are directed towards the four corners of the tetrahedron. The angle between \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbital is 109.5 as shown in Fig. 12.

**FIG. 12**Formation of \(sp^{3}\) hybrids by the combination of s. \(p_{x}\). \(p_{y}\) and \(p_{z}\) atomic orbitals of carbon and the formation of CH4 molecule

The structure of NH3 and H2O molecules can also be explained with the help of \(sp^{3}\) hybridisation. In NH3, the valence shell (outer) electronic configuration of nitrogen in the ground state is 2\(s^{2}\)2 \(p_{x}^{1}\) 2 \(p_{y}^{1}\) 2 \(p_{x}^{1}\) having three unpaired electrons in the \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbitals and a lone pair of electrons is present in the fourth one. These three hybrid orbitals overlap with 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form three N-H sigma bonds. We know that the force of repulsion between a lone pair and a bond pair is more than the force of repulsion between two bond pairs of electrons. The molecule thus gets distorted and the bond angle is reduced to 107 from 109.5. The geometry of such a molecule will be pyramidal as shown in Fig. 13.

**FIG. 13**Formation of NH3 molecule

In case of H2O molecule, the four oxygen orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) undergo sp3 hybridisation forming four \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbitals out of which two contain one electron each and the other two contain a pair of electrons. These four \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbitals acquire a tetrahedral geometry, with two corners occupied by hydrogen atoms while the other two by the lone pairs. The bond angle in this case is reduced to 104.5 from 109.5 (Fig. 14) and the molecule thus acquires a V-shape or angular geometry.

**FIG. 14**Formation of H2O molecule 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:119]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:120]

Now the five orbitals (_i.e._, one \(s\), three \(p\) and one \(d\) orbitals) are available for hybridisation to yield a set of five \(sp^{3}d\) hybrid orbitals which are directed towards the five corners of a trigonal bipyramidal as depicted in the Fig. 17.

It should be noted that all the bond angles in trigonal bipyramidal geometry are not equivalent. In \(\text{PCI}_{5}\) the five \(sp^{3}d\) orbitals of phosphorus overlap with the singly occupied \(p\) orbitals of chlorine atoms to form five P-Cl sigma bonds. Three P-Cl bond lie in one plane and make an angle of 120 with each other; these bonds are termed as equatorial bonds. The remaining two P-Cl bonds-one lying above and the other lying below the equatorial plane, make an angle of 90 with the plane. These bonds are called axial bonds. As the axial bond pairs suffer more repulsive interaction from the equatorial bond pairs, therefore axial bonds have been found to be slightly longer and hence slightly weaker than the equatorial bonds; which makes \(\text{PCI}_{5}\) molecule more reactive.

_(ii) Formation of \(\text{SF}_{6}\)(sp\({}^{3}d^{2}\) hybridisation):_ In \(\text{SF}_{6}\) the central sulphur atom has the ground state outer electronic configuration \(3s^{2}3p^{i}\). In the exited state the available six orbitals _i.e._, one \(s\), three \(p\) and two \(d\) are singly occupied by electrons. These orbitals hybridise to form six new \(sp^{3}d^{2}\) hybrid orbitals, which are projected towards the six corners of a regular octahedron in \(\text{SF}_{6}\). These six \(sp^{3}d^{2}\) hybrid orbitals overlap with singly occupied orbitals of fluorine atoms to form six S-F sigma bonds. Thus \(\text{SF}_{6}\) molecule has a regular octahedral geometry as shown in Fig. 18.

### Molecular Orbital Theory

Molecular orbital (MO) theory was developed by F. Hund and R.S. Mulliken in 1932. The salient features of this theory are :

1. The electrons in a molecule are present in the various molecular orbitals as the electrons of atoms are present in the various atomic orbitals.
2. The atomic orbitals of comparable energies and proper symmetry combine to form molecular orbitals.
3. While an electron in an atomic orbital is influenced by one nucleus, in a molecular orbital it is influenced by two or more nuclei depending upon the number of atoms in the molecule. Thus,

Figure 18: Octahedral geometry of \(\text{SF}_{6}\) molecule

Figure 17: Trigonal bipyramidal geometry of \(\text{PCI}_{5}\) molecule

an atomic orbital is monocentric while a molecular orbital is polycentric.
4. The number of molecular orbital formed is equal to the number of combining atomic orbitals. When two atomic orbitals combine, two molecular orbitals are formed. One is known as **bonding molecular orbital** while the other is called **antibonding molecular orbital**.
5. The bonding molecular orbital has lower energy and hence greater stability than the corresponding antibonding molecular orbital.
6. Just as the electron probability distribution around a nucleus in an atom is given by an atomic orbital, the electron probability distribution around a group of nuclei in a molecule is given by a molecular orbital.
7. The molecular orbitals like atomic orbitals are filled in accordance with the _augbau_ principle obeying the Pauli's exclusion principle and the Hund's rule.

#### Formation of Molecular Orbitals Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)

According to wave mechanics, the atomic orbitals can be expressed by wave functions (\(\psi\)'s) which represent the amplitude of the electron waves. These are obtained from the solution of Schrodinger wave equation. However, since it cannot be solved for any system containing more than one electron, molecular orbitals which are one electron wave functions for molecules are difficult to obtain directly from the solution of Schrodinger wave equation. To overcome this problem, an approximate method known as **linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)** has been adopted.

Let us apply this method to the homonuclear diatomic hydrogen molecule. Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting of two atoms A and B. Each hydrogen atom in the ground state has one electron in 1s orbital. The atomic orbitals of these atoms may be represented by the wave functions \(\psi_{\rm A}\) and \(\psi_{\rm H}\). Mathematically, the formation of molecular orbitals may be described by the linear combination of atomic orbitals that can take place by addition and by subtraction of wave functions of individual atomic orbitals as shown below :

\[\psi_{\rm MO}=\psi_{\rm A}\pm\psi_{\rm H}\]

Therefore, the two molecular orbitals \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma\)* are formed as :

\[\sigma=\psi_{\rm A}+\psi_{\rm H}\]

\[\sigma^{*}=\psi_{\rm A}-\psi_{\rm H}\]

The molecular orbital \(\sigma\) formed by the addition of atomic orbitals is called the **bonding molecular orbital** while the molecular orbital**?**formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital is called **antibonding molecular orbital** as depicted in Fig. 4.19.

Qualitatively, the formation of molecular orbitals can be understood in terms of the constructive or destructive interference of the electron waves of the combining atoms. In the formation of bonding molecular orbital, the two electron waves of the bonding atoms reinforce each other due to constructive interference while in the formation of

Figure 4.19: Formation of bonding (\(\sigma\)) and antibonding (\(\sigma^{*}\)) molecular orbitals by the linear combination of atomic orbitals \(\psi_{\rm A}\) and \(\psi_{\rm H}\) centered on two atoms A and B respectively.

antibonding molecular orbital, the electron waves cancel each other due to destructive interference. As a result, the electron density in a bonding molecular orbital is located between the nuclei of the bonded atoms because of which the repulsion between the nuclei is very less while in case of an antibonding molecular orbital, most of the electron density is located away from the space between the nuclei. Infact, there is a nodal plane (on which the electron density is zero) between the nuclei and hence the repulsion between the nuclei is high. Electrons placed in a bonding molecular orbital tend to hold the nuclei together and stabilise a molecule. Therefore, a bonding molecular orbital always possesses lower energy than either of the atomic orbitals that have combined to form it. In contrast, the electrons placed in the antibonding molecular orbital destabilise the molecule. This is because the mutual repulsion of the electrons in this orbital is more than the attraction between the electrons and the nuclei, which causes a net increase in energy.

It may be noted that the energy of the antibonding orbital is raised above the energy of the parent atomic orbitals that have combined and the energy of the bonding orbital has been lowered than the parent orbitals. The total energy of two molecular orbitals, however, remains the same as that of two original atomic orbitals.

#### Conditions for the Combination of Atomic Orbitals

The linear combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals takes place only if the following conditions are satisfied:

**1. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same or nearly the same energy**. This means that 1s orbital can combine with another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably higher than that of 1s orbital. This is not true if the atoms are very different.

**2. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same symmetry about the molecular axis.** By convention z-axis is taken as the molecular axis. It is important to note that atomic orbitals having same or nearly the same energy will not combine if they do not have the same symmetry. For example, \(2p_{x}\) orbital of one atom can combine with \(2p_{x}\) orbital of the other atom but not with the \(2p_{x}\) or \(2p_{y}\) orbitals because of their different symmetries.

**3. The combining atomic orbitals must overlap to the maximum extent**. Greater the extent of overlap, the greater will be the electron-density between the nuclei of a molecular orbital.

#### Types of Molecular Orbitals

Molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are designated as \(\sigma\) (sigma). \(\pi\) (pl). \(\delta\) (delta), etc.

In this nomenclature, the **sigma molecular orbitals are symmetrical around the bond-axis while pi (\(\pi\)) molecular orbitals are not symmetrical**. For example, the linear combination of 1s orbitals centered on two nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which are symmetrical around the bond-axis. Such molecular orbitals are of the \(\sigma\) type and are designed as \(\sigma\)1s and \(\sigma^{*}\)1s [Fig. 4.20(a),page 124]. **If internuclear axis is taken to be in the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear combination of 2\(p_{x}\)- orbitals of two atoms also produces two sigma molecular orbitals designated as \(\sigma\)2\(p_{x}\) and \(\sigma^{*}\)2\(p_{x}\)**. [Fig. 4.20(b)]

Molecular orbitals obtained from \(2p_{x}\) and \(2p_{y}\) orbitals are not symmetrical around the bond axis because of the presence of positive lobes above and negative lobes below the molecular plane. Such molecular orbitals, are labelled as \(\pi\) and \(\pi^{*}\) [Fig. 4.20(c)]. A \(\pi\) bonding MO has larger electron density above and below the inter-nuclear axis. The \(\pi^{*}\) antibonding MO has a node between the nuclei.

#### Energy Level Diagram for Molecular Orbitals

We have seen that 1s atomic orbitals on two atoms form two molecular orbitals designated as \(\sigma\)1s and \(\sigma^{*}\)1s. In the same manner, the 2s and \(2p\) atomic orbitals (eight atomic orbitalson two atoms) give rise to the following eight molecular orbitals:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Antibonding MOs}\ \ \sigma^{*}2s\ \sigma^{*}2p_{x}\ \ \pi^{*}2p_{x}\ \ \pi^{*}2p_{y}\\ \text{Bonding MOs}\ \ \sigma 2s\ \sigma 2p_{x}\ \ \pi 2p_{x}\ \ \pi 2p_{y}\end{array}\]

The energy levels of these molecular orbitals have been determined experimentally from spectroscopic data for homonuclear diatomic molecules of second row elements of the periodic table. The increasing order of

Figure 4.20: Contours and energies of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals formed through combinations of (a) 1s atomic orbitals: (b) 2p\({}_{x}\) atomic orbitals and (c) 2p\({}_{x}\) atomic orbitals.

energies of various molecular orbitals for O2 and F2 is given below :

\(\sigma 1s<\sigma^{*}1s<\sigma 2s<\sigma^{*}2s<\sigma 2p_{x}<\left(\pi\,2p_{x}= \pi\,2p_{y}\right)\)\(<\left(\pi\,^{*}2p_{x}=\pi\,^{*}2p_{y}\right)\)

However, this sequence of energy levels of molecular orbitals is not correct for the remaining molecules Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2. For instance, it has been observed experimentally that for molecules such as B2, C2, N2 etc. the increasing order of energies of various molecular orbitals is

\(\sigma 1s<\sigma^{*}1s<\sigma 2s<\sigma^{*}2s<\left(\pi\,2p_{x}=\pi\,2p_{y} \right)<\sigma 2p_{x}\)\(<\left(\pi\,^{*}2p_{x}=\pi\,^{*}2p_{y}\right)<\sigma ^{*}2p_{x}\)

The important characteristic feature of this order is that the **energy of \(\sigma 2p_{x}\) molecular orbital is higher than that of \(\pi\,2p_{x}\) and \(\pi\,2p_{y}\) molecular orbitals**.

#### 4.7.5 Electronic Configuration and Molecular Behaviour

The distribution of electrons among various molecular orbitals is called the **electronic configuration of the molecule**. From the electronic configuration of the molecule, it is possible to get important information about the molecule as discussed below.

#### 4.7.6 Stability of Molecules

If N2 is the number of electrons occupying bonding orbitals and N2 the number occupying the antibonding orbitals, then

1. the molecule is stable if N2 is greater than N2, and
2. the molecule is unstable if N2 is less than N2.

In (i) more bonding orbitals are occupied and so the bonding influence is stronger and a stable molecule results. In (ii) the antibonding influence is stronger and therefore the molecule is unstable.

7.7 Bond order (b.o.) is defined as one half the difference between the number of electrons present in the bonding and the antibonding orbitals i.e.,

Bond order (b.o.) = % (N2-N2)

The rules discussed above regarding the stability of the molecule can be restated in terms of bond order as follows: A positive bond order (i.e., N2 > N2) means a stable molecule while a negative (i.e., N2 <N2) or zero (i.e., N2 = N2) bond order means an unstable molecule.

7.8 Intergrand bond order values of 1, 2 or 3 correspond to single, double or triple bonds respectively as studied in the classical concept.

#### 4.7.9 Bond-length

The bond order between two atoms in a molecule may be taken as an approximate measure of the bond length. The bond length decreases as bond order increases.

#### 4.7.1 Magnetic nature

If all the molecular orbitals in a molecule are doubly occupied, the substance is diamagnetic (repelled by magnetic field). However if one or more molecular orbitals are singly occupied it is paramagnetic (attracted by magnetic field), e.g., O2 molecule.

### Bonding in some homonuclear diatomic molecules

In this section we shall discuss bonding in some homonuclear diatomic molecules.

#### 4.7.1 Hydrogen molecule (H2)

It is formed by the combination of two hydrogen atoms. Each hydrogen atom has one electron in 1s orbital. Therefore, in all there are two electrons in hydrogen molecule which are present in \(\sigma 1s\) molecular orbital. So electronic configuration of hydrogen molecule is

\(\mathrm{H_{2}}:(\sigma 1s)^{2}\)

The bond order of H2 molecule can be calculated as given below:

\(\mathrm{Bond\ order}=\frac{\mathrm{N_{b}-N_{a}}}{2}=\frac{2-}{2}\)

This means that the two hydrogen atoms are bonded together by a single covalent bond. The bond dissociation energy of hydrogen molecule has been found to be 438 kJ moland bond length equal to 74 pm. Since no unpaired electron is present in hydrogen molecule, therefore, it is diamagnetic.

_2. Helium molecule (He\({}_{2}\)):_ The electronic configuration of helium atom is 1s\({}^{2}\). Each helium atom contains 2 electrons, therefore, in He\({}_{2}\) molecule there would be 4 electrons. These electrons will be accommodated in \(\sigma\)1s and \(\sigma\)*1s molecular orbitals leading to electronic configuration:

\(\mathrm{He}_{2}:(\sigma 1s)^{2}\)\((\sigma^{*}1s)^{2}\)

Bond order of He\({}_{2}\) is \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(2-2)=0\)

He\({}_{2}\) molecule is therefore unstable and does not exist.

_Similarly, it can be shown that Be\({}_{2}\) molecule \((\sigma 1s)^{2}\)\((\sigma 2s)^{2}\)\((\sigma 2s)^{2}\) also does not exist._

_3. Lithium molecule (Li\({}_{2}\)):_ The electronic configuration of lithium is 1s\({}^{2}\), 2s\({}^{1}\). There are six electrons in Li\({}_{2}\). The electronic configuration of Li\({}_{2}\) molecule, therefore, is

\(\mathrm{Li}_{2}:(\sigma 1s)^{2}\)\((\sigma^{*}1s)^{2}\)\((\sigma 2s)^{2}\)

The above configuration is also written as KK(\(\sigma 2s)^{2}\) where KK represents the closed K shell structure \((\sigma 1s)^{2}\)\((\sigma^{*}1s)^{2}\).

From the electronic configuration of Li\({}_{2}\) molecule it is clear that there are four electrons present in bonding molecular orbitals and two electrons present in antibonding molecular orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(4-2)=1\). It means that Li\({}_{2}\) molecule is stable and since it has no unpaired electrons it should be diamagnetic. Indeed diamagnetic Li\({}_{2}\) molecules are known to exist in the vapour phase.

_4. Carbon molecule (C\({}_{2}\)):_ The electronic configuration of carbon is 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{2}\). There are twelve electrons in C\({}_{2}\). The electronic configuration of C\({}_{2}\) molecule, therefore, is

\(\mathrm{C}_{2}:(\sigma 1s)^{2}(\sigma*1s)^{2}(\sigma\)

or \(KK(\sigma 2s)^{2}(\sigma\) :

The bond order of C\({}_{2}\) is \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(8-4)=2\) and C\({}_{2}\) should be diamagnetic. Diamagnetic C\({}_{2}\) molecules have indeed been detected in vapour phase. It is important to note that double bond in C\({}_{2}\) consists of both pi bonds because of the presence of four electrons in two pi molecular orbitals. In most of the other molecules a double bond is made up of a sigma bond and a pi bond. In a similar fashion the bonding in N\({}_{2}\) molecule can be discussed.

_5. Oxygen molecule (O\({}_{2}\)):_ The electronic configuration of oxygen atom is 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{4}\). Each oxygen atom has 8 electrons, hence, in O\({}_{2}\) molecule there are 16 electrons. The electronic configuration of O\({}_{2}\) molecule, therefore, is

\(\mathrm{O}_{2}:(\sigma 1s)^{2}(\sigma^{*}1\)

\(\mathrm{O}_{2}:\)\((\sigma 2p_{x}^{2}=\pi\) 2 or

\(\mathrm{O}_{2}:\)\(\left[\begin{array}{c}KK\\ \left(\pi 2p_{z}^{2}=\right.\end{array}\right.\)

From the electronic configuration of O\({}_{2}\) molecule it is clear that ten electrons are present in bonding molecular orbitals and six electrons are present in antibonding molecular orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is

Bond order=

So in oxygen molecule, atoms are held by a double bond. Moreover, it may be noted that it contains two unpaired electrons in \(\pi*2p_{x}\) and \(\pi*2p_{y}\) molecular orbitals, therefore, \(\mathbf{O_{2}}\) molecule should be paramagnetic, a prediction that corresponds to experimental observation. In this way, the theory successfully explains the paramagnetic nature of oxygen.

Similarly, the electronic configurations of other n-monuclear diatomic molecules of the second row of the periodic table can be written. In Fig.4.21 are given the molecular orbital occupancy and molecular properties for B\({}_{2}\) through Ne\({}_{2}\). The sequence of MOs and their electron population are shown. The bond energy, bond length, bond order, magnetic properties and valence electron configuration appear below the orbital diagrams.

### Hydrogen Bonding

Nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine are the highly electronegative elements. When they are attached to a hydrogen atom to form covalent bond, the electrons of the covalent bond are shifted towards the more electronegative atom. This partially positively charged hydrogen atom forms a bond with the other more electronegative atom. This bond is known as hydrogen bond and is weaker than the covalent bond. For example, in HF molecule, the hydrogen bond exists between hydrogen atom of one molecule and fluorine atom of another molecule as depicted below : --H^8- F^8- Here, hydrogen bond acts as a bridge between two atoms which holds one atom by covalent bond and the other by hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bond is represented by a dotted line (--) while a solid line represents the covalent bond. **Thus, hydrogen bond can be defined as the attractive force which binds hydrogen atom of one molecule with the electronegative atom (F, O or N) of another molecule.**

### Cause of Formation of Hydrogen Bond

When hydrogen is bonded to strongly electronegative element 'X', the electron pair shared between the two atoms moves far away from hydrogen atom. As a result the hydrogen atom becomes highly electropositive with respect to the other atom 'X'. Since there is displacement of electrons towards X, the hydrogen acquires fractional positive charge (') while 'X' attain fractional negative charge

Figure 4.21: MO occupancy and molecular properties for \(B_{2}\) through Ne\({}_{x}\)(8-). This results in the formation of a polar molecule having electrostatic force of attraction which can be represented as :

\[\text{H}^{\delta\text{-}}-\text{X}^{\delta\text{-}}-\text{.}\]

The magnitude of H-bonding depends on the physical state of the compound. It is maximum in the solid state and minimum in the gaseous state. Thus, the hydrogen bonds have strong influence on the structure and properties of the compounds.

#### Types of H-Bonds

There are two types of H-bonds

**(i)**: Intermolecular hydrogen bond
**(ii)**: Intramolecular hydrogen bond
**(1)**: _Intermolecular hydrogen bond :_ It is formed between two different molecules of the same or different compounds. For example, H-bond in case of HF molecule, alcohol or water molecules, etc.

**(2)**: _Intramolecular hydrogen bond :_ It is formed when hydrogen atom is in between the two highly electronegative (F, O, N) atoms present within the same molecule. For example, in _o_-nitrophenol the hydrogen is in between the two oxygen atoms.

## Summary

K. ssel's first insight into the mechanism of formation of electropositive and electronegative ions related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by the respective ions. Electrostatic attraction between ions is the cause for their stability. This gives the concept of **electrovalency**.

The first description of **covalent bonding** was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing of electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols show the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures show pictorial representations of bonding in molecules.

An ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative ions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a charge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by the **enthalpy of lattice formation**.

While a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms, multiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms have additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding These are called lone-pairs of electrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around each atom in a molecule. **Important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like: bond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant effect on the properties of compounds.**

A number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single Lewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal structure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very important and extremely useful concept called **resonance**. The contributing structures or _canonical forms_ taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the molecule or ion.

The _VSEPR model_ used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on the assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far apart as possible. According to this model, _molecular geometry is determined by repulsions between lone pairs and lone pairs_ : _lone pairs and bonding pairs_ and _bonding pairs_. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp

The **valence bond (VB) approach** to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent. Basically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example the formation of the H\({}_{2}\) molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1 s orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken into account.

For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the concept of **hybridisation of atomic orbitals**. \(\mbox{sp},\mbox{sp}^{2}\), \(\mbox{sp}^{3}\) hybridizations of atomic orbitals of Be, B,C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules like \(\mbox{B}\,\mbox{e}\mbox{C}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 1}}\), \(\mbox{B}\mbox{C}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 1}}\), \(\mbox{C}\mbox{H}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 4}}\), \(\mbox{NH}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 3}}\) and \(\mbox{H}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 2}}\mbox{O}\). They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in molecules like \(\mbox{C}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 2}}\mbox{H}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 2}}\) and \(\mbox{C}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 2}}\mbox{H}_{\mbox{\scriptsize 4}}\).

The **molecular orbital (MO) theory** describes bonding in terms of the combination and arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more energy than the individual atomic orbitals.

The electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are said to be stable if the number of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that in antibonding molecular orbitals.

**Hydrogen bond** is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly electronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two or more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within the same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties of many compounds.

laws which govern the behaviour of matter in different states. In this unit, we will learn more about these three physical states of matter particularly liquid and gaseous states. To begin with, it is necessary to understand the nature of intermolecular forces, molecular interactions and effect of thermal energy on the motion of particles because a balance between these determines the state of a substance.

### 5.11 Intermolecular forces

**Intermolecular forces** are the forces of attraction and repulsion between interacting particles (atoms and molecules). This term does not include the electrostatic forces that exist between the two oppositely charged ions and the forces that hold atoms of a molecule together i.e., covalent bonds.

Attractive intermolecular forces are known as **van der Waals forces**, in honour of Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals (1837-1923), who explained the deviation of real gases from the ideal behaviour through these forces. We will learn about this later in this unit. van der Waals forces vary considerably in magnitude and include dispersion forces or London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and dipole-induced dipole forces. A particularly strong type of dipole-dipole interaction is hydrogen bonding. **Only a few elements can participate in hydrogen bond formation**, therefore it is treated as a separate category**. We have already learnt about this interaction in Unit 4.

At this point, it is important to note that attractive forces between an ion and a dipole are known as ion-dipole forces and these are not van der Waals forces. We will now learn about different types of van der Waals forces.

#### 5.1.1 Dispersion Forces or London Forces

Atoms and nonpolar molecules are electrically symmetrical and have no dipole moment because their electronic charge cloud is symmetrically distributed. But a dipole may develop momentarily even in such atoms and molecules. This can be understood as follows. Suppose we have two atoms 'A' and 'B' in the close vicinity of each other (Fig. 5.1a). It may so happen that momentarily electronic charge distribution in one of the atoms, say 'A', becomes un symmetrical _i.e._, the charge cloud is more on one side than the other (Fig. 5.1 b and c). This results in the development of instantaneous dipole on the atom 'A' for a very short time. This instantaneous or transient dipole distorts the electron density of the other atom 'B', which is close to it and as a consequence a dipole is induced in the atom 'B'.

The temporary dipoles of atom 'A' and 'B' attract each other. Similarly temporary dipoles are induced in molecules also. This force of attraction was first proposed by the German physicist Fritz London, and for this reason force of attraction between two temporary dipoles is known as **London force**. Another name for this force is **dispersion force**. These forces are always attractive and interaction energy is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between two interacting particles (i.e., \(1/r^{a}\) where \(r\) is the distance between two particles). These forces are important only at short distances (-500 pm) and their magnitude depends on the polarisability of the particle.

#### 5.1.2 Dipole - Dipole Forces

Dipole-dipole forces act between the molecules possessing permanent dipole. Ends of the dipoles possess "partial charges" and these charges are shown by Greek letter _delta_ (\(\delta\)). Partial charges are always less than the unit electronic charge (1.6 10-19 C). The polar molecules interact with neighbouring molecules. Fig 5.2 (a) shows electron cloud distribution in the dipole of hydrogen chloride and Fig. 5.2 (b) shows dipole-dipole interaction between two HCl molecules. This interaction is stronger than the London forces but is weaker than ion-ion interaction because only partial charges are involved. The attractive force decreases with the increase of distance between the dipoles. As in the above case here also, the interaction energy is inversely proportional to distance between polar molecules. Dipole-dipole interaction energy between stationary polar molecules (as in solids) is proportional to \(1/r^{3}\) and that between rotating polar molecules is proportional to \(1/r^{6}\), where \(r\) is the distance between polar molecules. Besides dipole-dipole interaction, polar molecules can interact by London forces also. Thus cumulative effect is that the total of intermolecular forces in polar molecules increase.

#### 5.1.3 Dipole-Induced Dipole Forces

This type of attractive forces operate between the polar molecules having permanent dipole and the molecules lacking permanent dipole. Permanent dipole of the polar molecule induces dipole on the electrically neutral molecule by deforming its electronic cloud (Fig. 5.3). Thus an induced dipole is developed in the other molecule. In this case also interaction energy is proportional to \(1/r^{6}\) where \(r\) is the distance between two molecules. Induced dipole moment depends upon the dipole moment present in the permanent dipole and the polarisability of the electrically neutral molecule. We have already learnt in Unit 4 that molecules of larger size can be easily polarized. High polarisability increases the strength of attractive interactions.

In this case also cumulative effect of dispersion forces and dipole-induced dipole interactions exists.

#### 5.1.4 Hydrogen bond

As already mentioned in section (5.1); this is special case of dipole-dipole interaction. We have already learnt about this in Unit 4. Thisis found in the molecules in which highly polar N-H, O-H or H-F bonds are present. Although hydrogen bonding is regarded as being limited to N, O and F: but species such as C1 may also participate in hydrogen bonding. Energy of hydrogen bond varies between 10 to 100 kJ mol-1. This is quite a significant amount of energy: therefore, hydrogen bonds are powerful force in determining the structure and properties of many compounds, for example proteins and nucleic acids. Strength of the hydrogen bond is determined by the coulombic interaction between the lone-pair electrons of the electronegative atom of one molecule and the hydrogen atom of other molecule. Following diagram shows the formation of hydrogen bond.

Intermolecular forces discussed so far are all attractive. **Molecules also exert repulsive forces** on one another. When two molecules are brought into close contact with each other, the repulsion between the electron clouds and that between the nuclei of two molecules comes into play. Magnitude of the repulsion rises very rapidly as the distance separating the molecules decreases. This is the reason that liquids and solids are hard to compress. In these states molecules are already in close contact; therefore they resist further compression; as that would result in the increase of repulsive interactions.

### Thermal energy

Thermal energy is the energy of a body arising from motion of its atoms or molecules. It is directly proportional to the temperature of the substance. It is the measure of average kinetic energy of the particles of the matter and is thus responsible for movement of particles. This movement of particles is called thermal motion.

### Internal energy

The internal energy of the molecules tends to keep them apart. Three states of matter are the result of balance between intermolecular forces and the thermal energy of the molecules.

When molecular interactions are very weak, molecules do not cling together to make liquid or solid unless thermal energy is reduced by lowering the temperature. Gases do not liquify on compression only, although molecules come very close to each other and intermolecular forces operate to the maximum. However, when thermal energy of molecules is reduced by lowering the temperature: the gases can be very easily liquified. Predominance of thermal energy and the molecular interaction energy of a substance in three states is depicted as follows :

We have already learnt the cause for the existence of the three states of matter. Now we will learn more about gaseous and liquid states and the laws which govern the behaviour of matter in these states. We shall deal with the solid state in class XII.

### The gases cause states

This is the simplest state of matter. Throughout our life we remain immersed in the ocean of air which is a mixture of gases. We spend our life in the lowermost layer of the atmosphere called troposphere. which is held to the surface of the earth by gravitational force. The thin layer of atmosphere is vital to our life. It shields us from harmful radiations and contains substances like dioxygen, dmitrogen. carbon dioxide. water vapour. etc.

Let us now focus our attention on the behaviour of substances which exist in the gaseous state under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. A look at the periodic table shows that only eleven elementsexist as gases under normal conditions (Fig 5.4).

The gaseous state is characterized by the following physical properties.

* Gases are highly compressible.
* Gases exert pressure equally in all directions.
* Gases have much lower density than the solids and liquids.
* The volume and the shape of gases are not fixed. These assume volume and shape of the container.
* Gases mix evenly and completely in all proportions without any mechanical aid.

Simplicity of gases is due to the fact that the forces of interaction between their molecules are negligible. Their behaviour is governed by same general laws, which were discovered as a result of their experimental studies. These laws are relationships between measurable properties of gases. Some of these properties like pressure, volume, temperature and mass are very important because relationships between these variables describe state of the gas. Interdependence of these variables leads to the formulation of gas laws. In the next section we will learn about gas laws.

### The gas laws

The gas laws which we will study now are the result of research carried on for several centuries on the physical properties of gases. The first reliable measurement on properties of gases was made by Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle in 1662. The law which he formulated is known as Boyle's Law. Later on attempts to fly in air with the help of hot air balloons motivated Jacques Charles and Joseph Lewis Gay Lussac to discover additional gas laws. Contribution from Avogadro and others provided lot of information about gaseous state.

### Boyle's Law (Pressure - Volume Relationship)

On the basis of his experiments, Robert Boyle reached to the conclusion that **at constant temperature, the pressure of a fixed amount** (i.e., number of moles \(n\)) **of gas varies inversely with its volume**. This is known as **B oyle's law**. Mathematically, it can be written as

\[p\ \propto\ \frac{1}{V}\ \ (\text{ at constant }T\text{ and }n) \tag{5.1}\]

\[.\] \[\Rightarrow\ \ p=\text{k}_{1}\ \frac{1}{V} \tag{5.2}\]

where \(\text{k}_{1}\) is the proportionality constant. The value of constant \(\text{k}_{1}\) depends upon the amount of the gas, temperature of the gas and the units in which \(p\) and \(V\) are expressed.

On rearranging equation (5.2) we obtain

\[pV=\text{k}_{1} \tag{5.3}\]

It means that at constant temperature, product of pressure and volume of a fixed amount of gas is constant.

If a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature \(T\) occupying volume \(V_{1}\) at pressure \(p_{1}\) undergoes expansion, so that volume becomes \(V_{2}\) and pressure becomes \(p_{2}\), then according to Boyle's law :

\[p_{1}V_{1}=p_{2}V_{2}=\text{ constant} \tag{5.4}\]

\[\cdot\] \[\Rightarrow\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}=\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} \tag{5.5}\]

Figure 5.4: Eleven elements that exist as gases

Figure 5.5 shows two conventional ways of graphically presenting Boyle's law. Fig. 5.5 (a) is the graph of equation (5.3) at different temperatures. The value of \(k_{1}\) for each curve is different because for a given mass of gas, it varies only with temperature. Each curve corresponds to a different constant temperature and is known as an **isotherm** (constant temperature plot). Higher curves correspond to higher temperature. It should be noted that volume of the gas doubles if pressure is halved. Table 5.1 gives effect of pressure on volume of 0.09 mol of CO2 at 300 K.

Fig 5.5 (b) represents the graph between \(p\) and \(\dfrac{1}{V}\). It is a straight line passing through origin. However at high pressures. gases deviate from Boyle's law and under such conditions a straight line is not obtained in the graph.

Experiments of Boyle, in a quantitative manner prove that gases are highly compressible because when a given mass of a gas is compressed, the same number of molecules occupy a smaller space. This means that gases become denser at high pressure. A relationship can be obtained between density and pressure of a gas by using Boyle's law :

By definition, density '\(d\)' is related to the mass '\(m\)' and the volume '\(V\)' by the relation \(d=\dfrac{m}{V}\). If we put value of \(V\) in this equation 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:138]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:139]

#### 5.5.4 Avogadro Law (Volume - Amount Relationship)

In 1811 Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro tried to combine conclusions of Dalton's atomic theory and Gay Lussac's law of combining volumes (Unit 1) which is now known as Avogadro law. It states that equal volumes of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. This means that as long as the temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume depends upon number of molecules of the gas or in other words amount of the gas. Mathematically we can write

\[V\propto n\]

where \(n\) is the number of moles of the gas.

\[\Rightarrow V=\mathrm{k}_{4}\,n\]

The number of molecules in one mole of a gas has been determined to be 6.022 1023 and is known as Avogadro constant. You will find that this is the same number which we came across while discussing definition of a'mole' (Unit 1).

Since volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles; one mole of each gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP)* will have same volume. Standard temperature and pressure means 273.15 K (0*C) temperature and 1 bar (i.e., exactly 10\({}^{5}\) pascal) pressure. These values approximate freezing temperature of water and atmospheric pressure at sea level. At STP molar volume of an ideal gas or a combination of ideal gases is 22.71098 L mol-1.

Molar volume of some gases is given in Table 5.2.

\[n=\frac{\cdot}{\mathrm{M}}\]

Where \(m\) = mass of the gas under investigation and M = molar mass Thus,

\[V=\mathrm{k}_{4}\,\frac{m}{\mathrm{M}}\]

Equation (5.13) can be rearranged as follows :

\[M=\mathrm{k}_{4}\,\frac{m}{V}=\mathrm{k}_{4}d\]

Figure 5.7: Pressure vs temperature (K) graph (Isachores) of a gas.

Here '\(d\) is the density of the gas. We can conclude from equation (5.14) that the density of a gas is directly proportional to its molar mass.

A gas that follows Boyle's law, Charles' law and Avogadro law strictly is called **an ideal gas**. Such a gas is hypothetical. It is assumed that intermolecular forces are not present between the molecules of an ideal gas. Real gases follow these laws only under certain specific conditions when forces of interaction are practically negligible. In all other situations these deviate from ideal behaviour. You will learn about the deviations later in this unit.

### IDEAL GAS EQUATION

The three laws which we have learnt till now can be combined together in a single equation which is known as **ideal gas equation**.

At constant \(T\) and \(n\); \(V\propto\frac{1}{p}\)**Boyle's Law**

At constant \(p\) and \(n\); \(V\propto T\)**Charles' Law**

At constant \(p\) and \(T\); \(V\propto n\)**Avogadro Law**

Thus,

\[V\propto\frac{nT}{p} \tag{5.15}\]

\[\Rightarrow V=R\frac{nT}{p} \tag{5.16}\]

where R is proportionality constant. On rearranging the equation (5.16) we obtain

\[pV=n\ RT \tag{5.17}\]

\[\Rightarrow R=\frac{pV}{nT} \tag{5.18}\]

R is called gas constant. It is same for all gases. Therefore it is also called **Universal Gas Constant**, Equation (5.17) is called **ideal gas equation**.

Equation (5.18) shows that the value of R depends upon units in which \(p\), \(V\) and \(T\) are measured. If three variables in this equation are known, fourth can be calculated. From this equation we can see that at constant temperature and pressure \(n\) moles of any gas will have the same volume because \(V=\frac{nRT}{p}\) and \(n\),R,\(T\) and \(p\) are constant. This equation will be applicable to any gas, under those conditions when behaviour of the gas approaches ideal behaviour. Volume of one mole of an ideal gas under STP conditions (273.15 K and 1 bar pressure) is 22.710981 L mol\({}^{-1}\). Value of R for one mole of an ideal gas can be calculated under these conditions as follows :

R = \(\frac{\left(10^{5}\,\mathrm{Pa}\right)\!\left(\right.}{1\,\mathrm{mol}}\)

= 8.314 Pa m\({}^{3}\) K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{1}\)

= 8.314 10\({}^{2}\) bar L K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{1}\)

= 8.314 J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)

At STP conditions used earlier (0 C and 1 atm pressure), value of R is 8.20578 10\({}^{-2}\) L atm K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\).

Ideal gas equation is a relation between four variables and it describes the state of any gas, therefore, it is also called **equation of state**.

Let us now go back to the ideal gas equation. This is the relationship for the simultaneous variation of the variables. If temperature, volume and pressure of a fixed amount of gas vary from \(T_{1}\), \(V_{1}\) and \(p_{1}\) to \(T_{2}\), \(V_{2}\) and \(p_{2}\) then we can write

\[\frac{\dot{p_{1}}V_{1}}{T_{1}}=nR\quad\mathrm{a}:\]

\[\cdot\]

\[\Rightarrow\ \frac{p_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}}{\dot{\gamma}} \tag{5.19}\]

Equation (5.19) is a very useful equation. If out of six, values of five variables are known, the value of unknown variable can be calculated from the equation (5.19). This equation is also known as **Combined gas law**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:142]

\[\cdot p_{2}=\frac{n_{2}RT}{V}\] (5.26) \[\cdot p_{3}=\frac{n_{3}RT}{V}\] (5.27) where \(n_{1}\)\(n_{2}\) and \(n_{3}\) are number of moles of these gases. Thus, expression for total pressure will be \[p_{\text{Total}}=\ p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}\] \[\cdot\] \[=n_{1}\frac{RT}{V}+n_{2}\cdot\] \[=\{n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}\}\cdot\frac{RT}{V}\] (5.28) On dividing \(p_{1}\) by \(p_{\text{total}}\) we get \[\cdot\frac{p_{1}}{p_{\text{total}}}=\left(\frac{n}{n_{1}+n_{3}}\right.\] \[\cdot\] where n = n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}\] \[x_{1}\text{ is called mole fraction of first gas.}\] Thus. \(p_{1}=x_{1}\)\(p_{\text{total}}\) Similarly for other two gases we can write \[p_{2}=x_{2}\ p_{\text{total}}\text{ and }p_{3}=x_{3}\ p_{\text{total}}\] Thus a general equation can be written as \[p_{1}=x_{1}\,p_{\text{total}}\] (5.29) where \(p_{1}\,and\,x_{1}\) are partial pressure and mole fraction of \(i^{\text{th}}\) gas respectively. If total pressure of a mixture of gases is known, the equation (5.29) can be used to find out pressure exerted by individual gases.

**Problem 5.4**

A neon-dioxygen mixture contains 70.6 g dioxygen and 167.5 g neon. If pressure of the mixture of gases in the cylinder is 25 bar. What is the partial pressure of dioxygen and neon in the mixture?

Number of moles of dioxygen

### Kinetic molecular theory of gases

So far we have learnt the laws (e.g., Boyle's law. Charles' law etc.) which are concise statements of experimental facts observed in the laboratory by the scientists. Conducting careful experiments is an important aspect of scientific method and it tells us how the particular system is behaving under different conditions. However, once the experimental facts are established, a scientist is curious to know why the system is behaving in that way. For example, gas laws help us to predict that pressure increases when we compress gasesbut we would like to know what happens at molecular level when a gas is compressed? A theory is constructed to answer such questions. A theory is a model (i.e., a mental picture) that enables us to better understand our observations. The theory that attempts to elucidate the behaviour of gases is known as kinetic molecular theory.

Assumptions or postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases are given below. These postulates are related to atoms and molecules which cannot be seen, hence it is said to provide a microscopic model of gases.

* Gases consist of large number of identical particles (atoms or molecules) that are so small and so far apart on the average that the actual volume of the molecules is negligible in comparison to the empty space between them. They are considered as point masses. This assumption explains the great compressibility of gases.
* There is no force of attraction between the particles of a gas at ordinary temperature and pressure. The support for this assumption comes from the fact that gases expand and occupy all the space available to them.
* Particles of a gas are always in constant and random motion. If the particles were at rest and occupied fixed positions, then a gas would have had a fixed shape which is not observed.
* Particles of a gas move in all possible directions in straight lines. During their random motion, they collide with each other and with the walls of the container. Pressure is exerted by the gas as a result of collision of the particles with the walls of the container.
* Collisions of gas molecules are perfectly elastic. This means that total energy of molecules before and after the collision remains same. There may be exchange of energy between colliding molecules, their individual energies may change, but the sum of their energies remains constant. If there were loss of kinetic energy, the motion of molecules will stop and gases will settle down. This is contrary to what is actually observed.
* At any particular time, different particles in the gas have different speeds and hence different kinetic energies. This assumption is reasonable because as the particles collide, we expect their speed to change. Even if initial speed of all the particles was same. the molecular collisions will disrupt this uniformity. Consequently the particles must have different speeds, which go on changing constantly. It is possible to show that though the individual speeds are changing, the distribution of speeds remains constant at a particular temperature.
* If a molecule has variable speed, then it must have a variable kinetic energy. Under these circumstances, we can talk only about average kinetic energy. In kinetic theory it is assumed that average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. It is seen that on heating a gas at constant volume, the pressure increases. On heating the gas, kinetic energy of the particles increases and these strike the walls of the container more frequently thus exerting more pressure.

Kinetic theory of gases allows us to derive theoretically, all the gas laws studied in the previous sections. Calculations and predictions based on kinetic theory of gases agree very well with the experimental observations and thus establish the correctness of this model.

### BEHAVIOUR OF REAL GASES: DEVIATION FROM IDEAL GAS BEHAVIOUR

Our theoretical model of gases corresponds very well with the experimental observations. Difficulty arises when we try to test how far the relation \(pV=nRT\) reproduce actual pressure-volume-temperature relationship of gases. To test this point we plot \(pV\)_vs_\(p\) plot of gases because at constant temperature, \(pV\) will be constant (Boyle's law) and \(pV\)_vs_\(p\) graph at all pressures will be a straight line parallel to x-axis. Fig. 8 shows such a plot constructed from actual data for several gases at 273 K.

It can be seen easily that at constant temperature \(pV\)_vs_\(p\) plot for real gases is not a straight line. There is a significant deviation from ideal behaviour. Two types of curves are seen.In the curves for dihydrogen and helium, as the pressure increases the value of \(pV\) also increases. The second type of plot is seen in the case of other gases like carbon monoxide and methane. In these plots first there is a negative deviation from ideal behaviour, the \(pV\) value decreases with increase in pressure and reaches to a minimum value characteristic of a gas. After that \(pV\) value starts increasing. The curve then crosses the line for ideal gas and after that shows positive deviation continuously. It is thus, found that real gases do not follow ideal gas equation perfectly under all conditions.

Deviation from ideal behaviour also becomes apparent when pressure _vs_ volume plot is drawn. The pressure _vs_ volume plot of experimental data (real gas) and that theoretically calculated from Boyle's law (ideal gas) should coincide. Fig 9 shows these plots. It is apparent that at very high pressure the measured volume is more than the calculated volume. At low pressures, measured and calculated volumes approach each other.

It is found that real gases do not follow, Boyle's law, Charles law and Avogadro law perfectly under all conditions. Now two questions arise.

1. Why do gases deviate from the ideal behaviour?
2. What are the conditions under which gases deviate from ideality?

We get the answer of the first question if we look into postulates of kinetic theory once again. We find that two assumptions of the kinetic theory do not hold good. These are

1. There is no force of attraction between the molecules of a gas.
2. Volume of the molecules of a gas is negligibly small in comparison to the space occupied by the gas. If assumption (a) is correct, the gas will never liquify. However, we know that gases do liquify when cooled and compressed. Also, liquids formed are very difficult to compress.

Figure 8: Plot of \(pV\)_vs_\(p\)_for real gas and idealgas

Figure 9: Plot of pressure vs volume for real gas and idealgas

This means that forces of repulsion are powerful enough and prevent squashing of molecules in tiny volume. If assumption (b) is correct, the pressure _vs_ volume graph of experimental data (real gas) and that theoretically calculated from Boyles law (ideal gas) should coincide.

Real gases show deviations from ideal gas law because molecules interact with each other. At high pressures molecules of gases are very close to each other. Molecular interactions start operating. At high pressure, molecules do not strike the walls of the container with full impact because these are dragged back by other molecules due to molecular attractive forces. This affects the pressure exerted by the molecules on the walls of the container. Thus, the pressure exerted by the gas is lower than the pressure exerted by the ideal gas.

\[p_{ideal}=p_{real}\quad. \tag{5.30}\]

\[\text{observed correction}\]

pressure term

Here. a is a constant.

Repulsive forces also become significant. Repulsive interactions are short-range interactions and are significant when molecules are almost in contact. This is the situation at high pressure. The repulsive forces cause the molecules to behave as small but impenetrable spheres. The volume occupied by the molecules also becomes significant because instead of moving in volume \(V\), these are now restricted to volume (\(V\)-\(n\)b) where \(n\)b is approximately the total volume occupied by the molecules themselves. Here, b is a constant. Having taken into account the corrections for pressure and volume, we can rewrite equation (5.17) as

\[\dot{\left(p+\frac{\text{a}n^{2}}{V^{2}}\right)}\left(V-\right. \tag{5.31}\]

Equation (5.31) is known as van der Waals equation. In this equation \(n\) is number of moles of the gas. Constants a and b are called van der Waals constants and their value depends on the characteristic of a gas. Value of 'a' is measure of magnitude of intermolecular attractive forces within the gas and is independent of temperature and pressure.

Also, at very low temperature, intermolecular forces become significant. As the molecules travel with low average speed, these can be captured by one another due to attractive forces. Real gases show ideal behaviour when conditions of temperature and pressure are such that the intermolecular forces are practically negligible. The real gases show ideal behaviour when pressure approaches zero.

The deviation from ideal behaviour can be measured in terms of **compressibility factor**\(Z\), which is the ratio of product \(pV\) and \(nRT\). Mathematically

\[Z=\frac{pV}{nRT} \tag{5.32}\]

For ideal gas \(Z=1\) at all temperatures and pressures because \(pV\)\(nRT\). The graph of \(Z\)_vs_\(p\) will be a straight line parallel to pressure axis (Fig. 5.10). For gases which deviate from ideality, value of \(Z\) deviates from unity. At very low pressures all gases shown

Figure 5.10: Variation of compressibility factor for some gases

have Z =1 and behave as ideal gas. At high pressure all the gases have Z > 1. These are more difficult to compress. At intermediate pressures, most gases have Z < 1. Thus gases show ideal behaviour when the volume occupied is large so that the volume of the molecules can be neglected in comparison to it. In other words, the behaviour of the gas becomes more ideal when pressure is very low. Upto what pressure a gas will follow the ideal gas law, depends upon nature of the gas and its temperature. The temperature at which a real gas obeys ideal gas law over an appreciable range of pressure is called **Boyle temperature or Boyle point.** Boyle point of a gas depends upon its nature. Above their Boyle point, real gases show positive deviations from ideality and Z values are greater than one. The forces of attraction between the molecules are very feeble. Below Boyle temperature real gases first show decrease in Z value with increasing pressure, which reaches a minimum value. On further increase in pressure, the value of Z increases continuously. Above explanation shows that at low pressure and high temperature gases show ideal behaviour. These conditions are different for different gases.

More insight is obtained in the significance of Z if we note the following derivation

\[Z=\frac{pV_{\rm real}}{nRT} \tag{5.33}\]

If the gas shows ideal behaviour then \(\cdot\)

\[V_{\rm ideal}=\frac{nRT}{p}\cdot\mbox{On putting this value of }\frac{nRT}{p}\]

in equation (5.33) we have

\[Z=\frac{V_{\rm real}}{V_{\rm ideal}} \tag{5.34}\]

From equation (5.34) we can see that compressibility factor is the ratio of actual molar volume of a gas to the molar volume of it, if it were an ideal gas at that temperature and pressure.

In the following sections we will see that it is not possible to distinguish between gaseous state and liquid state and that liquids may be considered as continuation of gas phase into a region of small volumes and very high molecular attraction. We will also see how we can use isotherms of gases for predicting the conditions for liquefaction of gases.

### Liquification of gases

First complete data on pressure - volume - temperature relations of a substance in both gaseous and liquid state was obtained by Thomas Andrews on carbon dioxide. He plotted isotherms of carbon dioxide at various temperatures (Fig. 5.11). Later on it was found that real gases behave in the same manner as carbon dioxide. Andrews noticed that at high temperatures isotherms look like that of an ideal gas and the gas cannot be liquified even at very high pressure. As the temperature is lowered, shape of the curve changes and data shows considerable deviation from ideal behaviour. At 30.98 C

Figure 5.11: Isotherms of carbon dioxide at various temperatures

carbon dioxide remains gas upto 73 atmospheric pressure. (Point E in Fig. 5.11). At 73 atmospheric pressure, liquid carbon dioxide appears for the first time. The temperature 30.98 C is called **critical temperature (T\({}_{c}\))** of carbon dioxide. This is the highest temperature at which liquid carbon dioxide is observed. Above this temperature it is gas. Volume of one mole of the gas at critical temperature is called **critical volume (V\({}_{c}\))** and pressure at this temperature is called **critical pressure (\(p_{c}\))**. The critical temperature, pressure and volume are called critical constants. Further increase in pressure simply compresses the liquid carbon dioxide and the curve represents the compressibility of the liquid. The steep line represents the isotherm of liquid. Even a slight compression results in steep rise in pressure indicating very low compressibility of the liquid. Below 30.98 C, the behaviour of the gas on compression is quite different. At 21.5 C, carbon dioxide remains as a gas only upto point B. At point B, liquid of a particular volume appears. Further compression does not change the pressure. Liquid and gaseous carbon dioxide coexist and further application of pressure results in the condensation of more gas until the point C is reached. At point C, all the gas has been condensed and further application of pressure merely compresses the liquid as shown by steep line. A slight compression from volume \(V_{2}\) to \(V_{3}\) results in steep rise in pressure from \(p_{2}\) to \(p_{3}\) (Fig. 5.11). Below 30.98 C (critical temperature) each curve shows the similar trend. Only length of the horizontal line increases at lower temperatures. At critical point horizontal portion of the isotherm merges into one point. Thus we see that a point like A in the Fig. 5.11 represents gaseous state. A point like D represents liquid state and a point under the dome shaped area represents existence of liquid and gaseous carbon dioxide in equilibrium. All the gases upon compression at constant temperature (isothermal compression) show the same behaviour as shown by carbon dioxide. Also above discussion shows that gases should be cooled below their critical temperature for liquification. Critical temperature of a gas is highest temperature at which liquifaction of the gas first occurs. Liquidation of so called permanent gases (i.e., gases which show continuous positive deviation in Z value) requires cooling as well as considerable compression. Compression brings the molecules in close vicinity and cooling slows down the movement of molecules therefore, intermolecular interactions may hold the closely and slowly moving molecules together and the gas liquifies.

It is possible to change a gas in to liquid or a liquid into gas by a process in which always a single phase is present. For example in Fig. 5.11 we can move from point A to F vertically by in creasing the temperature, then we can reach the point G by compressing the gas at the constant temperature along this isotherm (isotherm at 31.1 C). The pressure will increase. Now we can move vertically down towards D by lowering the temperature. As soon as we cross the point H on the critical isotherm we get liquid. We end up with liquid but in this series of changes we do not pass through two-phase region. If process is carried out at the critical temperature, substance always remains in one phase.

Thus there is continuity between the gaseous and liquid state. The term fluid is used for either a liquid or a gas to recognise this continuity. Thus a liquid can be viewed as a very dense gas. Liquid and gas can be distinguished only when the fluid is below its critical temperature and its pressure and volume lie under the dome, since in that situation liquid and gas are in equilibrium and a surface separating the two phases is visible. In the absence of this surface there is no fundamental way of distinguishing between two states. At critical temperature, liquid passes into gaseous state imperceptibly and continuously: the surface separating two phases disappears (Section 5.10.1). A gas below the critical temperature can be liquified by applying pressure, and is called **vapour** of the substance. Carbon dioxide gas below its critical temperature is called carbon dioxide vapour. Critical constants for some common substances are given in Table 5.4.

Table 5.4 Critical Constants for Some Substances

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Substance** & \(T_{e}\) /K & \(p_{e}\) /bar & \(V_{e}\)/dm\({}^{3}\)mot\({}^{4}\) \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\) & 33.2 & 12.97 & 0.0650 \\ \hline He & 5.3 & 2.29 & 0.0577 \\ \hline N\({}_{2}\) & 126. & 33.9 & 0.0900 \\ \hline O\({}_{2}\) & 154.3 & 50.4 & 0.0744 \\ \hline CO\({}_{2}\) & 304.10 & 73.9 & 0.0956 \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)O & 647.1 & 220.6 & 0.0450 \\ \hline NH\({}_{3}\) & 405.5 & 113.0 & 0.0723 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Problem 5.5**

Gases possess characteristic critical temperature which depends upon the magnitude of intermolecular forces between the gas particles. Critical temperatures of ammonia and carbon dioxide are 405.5 K and 304.10 K respectively. Which of these gases will liquify first when you start cooling from 500 K to their critical temperature?

**Solution**

Ammonia will liquify first because its critical temperature will be reached first. Liquidation of CO\({}_{2}\) will require more cooling.

### Liquid State

Intermolecular forces are stronger in liquid state than in gaseous state. Molecules in liquids are so close that there is very little empty space between them and under normal conditions liquids are denser than gases.

Molecules of liquids are held together by attractive intermolecular forces. Liquids have definite volume because molecules do not separate from each other. However, molecules of liquids can move past one another freely, therefore, liquids can flow, can be poured and can assume the shape of the container in which these are stored. In the following sections we will look into some of the physical properties of the liquids such as vapour pressure, surface tension and viscosity.

#### 5.10.1 Vapour Pressure

If an evacuated container is partially filled with a liquid, a portion of liquid evaporates to fill the remaining volume of the container with vapour. Initially the liquid evaporates and pressure exerted by vapours on the walls of the container (vapour pressure) increases. After some time it becomes constant, an equilibrium is established between liquid phase and vapour phase, vapour pressure at this stage is known as equilibrium vapour pressure or saturated vapour pressure. Since process of vapourisation is temperature dependent; the temperature must be mentioned while reporting the vapour pressure of a liquid.

When a liquid is heated in an open vessel, the liquid vapourises from the surface. At the temperature at which vapour pressure of the liquid becomes equal to the external pressure, vapourisation can occur throughout the bulk of the liquid and vapours expand freely into the surroundings. The condition of free vapourisation throughout the liquid is called boiling. The temperature at which vapour pressure of liquid is equal to the external pressure is called boiling temperature at that pressure. Vapour pressure of some common liquids at various temperatures is given in (Fig. 5.12). At 1 atm pressure boiling temperature is called **normal boiling point**. If pressure is 1 bar then the boiling point is called **standard boiling point** of the liquid. Standard boiling point of the liquid is slightly lower than the normal boiling point because 1 bar pressure is slightly less than 1 atm pressure. The normal boiling point of water is 100 C (373 K), its standard boiling point is 99.6 C (372.6 K).

At high altitudes atmospheric pressure is low. Therefore liquids at high altitudes boil at lower temperatures in comparison to that at sea level. Since water boils at low temperature on hills, the pressure cooker is used for cooking food. In hospitals surgical instruments are sterilized in autoclaves in which boiling point of water is increased by increasing the pressure above the atmospheric pressure by using a weight covering the vent.

Boiling does not occur when liquid is heated in a closed vessel. On heating continuously vapour pressure increases. At first a clear boundary is visible between liquid and vapour phase because liquid is more dense than vapour. As the temperature increases more and more molecules go to vapour phase and density of vapours rises. At the same time liquid becomes less dense. It expands because molecules move apart. When density of liquid and vapours becomes the same; the clear boundary between liquid and vapours disappears. This temperature is called **critical temperature** about which we have already discussed in section 5.9.

#### 5.10.2 Surface Tension

It is well known (act that liquids assume the shape of the container. Why is it then small drops of mercury form spherical bead instead of spreading on the surface. Why do particles of soil at the bottom of river remain separated but they stick together when taken out? Why does a liquid rise (or fall) in a thin capillary as soon as the capillary touches the surface of the liquid? All these phenomena are caused due to the characteristic property of liquids, called **surface tension**. A molecule in the bulk of liquid experiences equal intermolecular forces from all sides. The molecule, therefore does not experience any net force, But for the molecule on the surface of liquid, net attractive force is towards the interior of the liquid (Fig. 13), due to the molecules below it. Since there are no molecules above it.

Liquids tend to minimize their surface area. The molecules on the surface experience a net downward force and have more energy than the molecules in the bulk, which do not experience any net force. Therefore, liquids tend to have minimum number of molecules at their surface. If surface of the liquid is increased by pulling a molecule from the bulk, attractive forces will have to be overcome. This will require expenditure of energy. The energy required to increase the surface area of the liquid by one unit is defined as surface energy.

Figure 13: Forces acting on a molecule on liquid surface and on a molecule inside the liquid

Figure 12: Vapour pressure vs temperature curve of some common liquids.

Its dimensions are \(J\) m-2. Surface tension is defined as the force acting per unit length perpendicular to the line drawn on the surface of liquid. It is denoted by Greek letter \(\gamma\) (Gamma). It has dimensions of kg s-2 and in SI unit it is expressed as N m-1. The lowest energy state of the liquid will be when surface area is minimum. Spherical shape satisfies this condition, that is why mercury drops are spherical in shape. This is the reason that sharp glass edges are heated for making them smooth. On heating, the glass melts and the surface of the liquid tends to take the rounded shape at the edges, which makes the edges smooth. This is called fire polishing of glass.

Liquid tends to rise (or fall) in the capillary because of surface tension. Liquids wet the things because they spread across their surfaces as thin film. Moist soil grains are pulled together because surface area of thin film of water is reduced. It is surface tension which gives stretching property to the surface of a liquid. On flat surface, droplets are slightly flattened by the effect of gravity; but in the gravity free environments drops are perfectly spherical.

The magnitude of surface tension of a liquid depends on the attractive forces between the molecules. When the attractive forces are large, the surface tension is large. Increase in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and effectiveness of intermolecular attraction decreases, so surface tension decreases as the temperature is raised.

### Viscosity

It is one of the characteristic properties of liquids. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to flow which arises due to the internal friction between layers of fluid as they slip past one another while liquid flows. Strong intermolecular forces between molecules hold them together and resist movement of layers past one another.

When a liquid flows over a fixed surface, the layer of molecules in the immediate contact of surface is stationary. The velocity of upper layers increases as the distance of layers from the fixed layer increases. This type of flow in which there is a regular gradation of velocity in passing from one layer to the next is called **laminar flow**. If we choose any layer in the flowing liquid (Fig.5.14), the layer above it accelerates its flow and the layer below this retards its flow.

If the velocity of the layer at a distance \(dz\) is changed by a value \(du\) then velocity gradient is given by the amount \(\frac{du}{dz}\). A force is required to maintain the flow of layers. This force is proportional to the area of contact of layers and velocity gradient i.e.

\(f\propto A\) (\(A\) is the area of contact)

\(f\propto\frac{du}{dz}\) (where, \(\frac{du}{dz}\) is velocity gradient; the change in velocity with distance)

\(F\propto A\).\(\frac{du}{dz}\)

\(\Rightarrow f=\eta A\frac{du}{dz}\)

\(\cdot\)'\(\eta\)' is proportionality constant and is called **coefficient of viscosity**. Viscosity coefficient is the force when velocity gradient is unity and the area of contact is unit area. Thus '\(\eta\)' is measure of viscosity. SI unit of viscosity coefficient is 1 newton second per square metre (N s m-2) = pascal second (Pa s = 1kg m-1s-1). In cgs system the unit of coefficient of viscosity is poise (named after great scientist Jean Louise Poiseuille).

Figure 5.14: Gradation of velocity in the laminar flow

1 poise = 1 g cm\({}^{-1}\)s\({}^{-1}\) = 10\({}^{-1}\)kg m\({}^{-1}\)s\({}^{-1}\)

Greater the viscosity, the more slowly the liquid flows. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces are strong enough to cause high viscosity. Glass is an extremely viscous liquid. It is so viscous that many of its properties resemble solids. However, property of flow of glass can be experienced by measuring the thickness of windowpanes of old buildings. These become thicker at the bottom than at the top. Viscosity of liquids decreases as the temperature rises because at high temperature molecules have high kinetic energy and can overcome the intermolecular forces to slip past one another between the layers.

## 5.1. Summary

### 5.1.1.

Intermolecular forces operate between the particles of matter. These forces differ from pure electrostatic forces that exist between two oppositely charged ions. Also, these do not include forces that hold atoms of a covalent molecule together through covalent bond. Competition between thermal energy and intermolecular interactions determines the state of matter. "Bulk" properties of matter such as behavior or of gases, characteristics of solids and liquids and change of state depend upon energy of constituent particles and the type of interaction between them. Chemical properties of a substance do not change with change of state, but the reactivity depends upon the physical state.

Forces of interaction between gas molecules are negligible and are almost independent of their chemical nature. Interdependence of some observable properties namely pressure, volume, temperature and mass leads to different gas laws obtained from experimental studies on gases. **Boyle's law** states that under isothermal condition, pressure of a fixed amount of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. **Charles' law** is a relationship between volume and absolute temperature under isobaric condition. It states that volume of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (\(V\approx T\)). If state of a gas is represented by \(p_{i}\), \(V_{i}\) and \(T_{i}\) and it changes to state at \(p_{2}\), \(V_{2}\) and \(T_{2}\), then relationship between these two states is given by combined gas law according to which \(\frac{p_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}\). Any one of the variables of this gas can be found out if other five variables are known. **Avogadro law** states that equal volumes of all gases under same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. **Dalton's law of partial pressure states that total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of partial pressures exerted by them. Thus \(p=p_{i}+p_{2}+p_{3}+...\) Relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and number of moles of a gas describes its state and is called equation of state of the gas. Equation of state for ideal gas is \(pV\)=nRT, where R is a gas constant and its value depends upon units chosen for pressure, volume and temperature.

At high pressure and low temperature intermolecular forces start operating strongly between the molecules of gases because they come close to each other. Under suitable temperature and pressure conditions gases can be liquified. Liquids may be considered as continuation of gas phase into a region of small volume and \(\mathrm{versus}\,\mathrm{fm}\)olecular attractions. Some properties of liquids \(e\,g\). surface tension and viscosity are due to \(\mathrm{strong}\,\mathrm{inter}\,\mathrm{molecular}\) attractive forces.

## Chapter 6 Thermodynamics

### 6.1 Thermodynamic State

We are interested in chemical reactions and the energy changes accompanying them. In order to quantify these energy changes, we need to separate the system which is under observations, from remaining part of the universe.

#### 6.1.1 The System and the Surroundings

A **system** in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. The surroundings include everything other than the system. System and the surroundings together constitute the universe.

Theuniverse = The system + The surroundings

However, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the surroundings are that portion of the remaining universe which can interact with the system. Usually, the region of space in the neighbourhood of the system constitutes its surroundings.

For example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 6.1).

Note that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. The wall that separates the system from the surroundings is called **boundary**. This is designed to allow us to control and keep track of all movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.

#### 6.1.2 Types of the System

We further classify the systems according to the movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.

#### 6.1.1 Open System

In an open system. thereis exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings [Fig. 6.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface enclosing the beaker and reactants.

#### 6.2.3 Closed System

In a closed system, there is no exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings [Fig. 6.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a closed vessel made of conducting material e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed system.

3 Isolated System

In an isolated system, there is no exchange of energy or matter between the system and the surroundings [Fig. 6.2 (c)]. The presence of reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel is an example of an isolated system.

6.1.3 The State of the System

The system must be described in order to make any useful calculations by specifying qu an ultatively each of the properties such as its pressure (\(p\)), volume (\(V\)), and temperature (\(T\)) as well as the composition of the system. We need to describe the system by specifying it before and after the change. You would recall from your Physics course that the state of a system in mechanics is completely specified at a given instant of time, by the position and velocity of each mass point of the system. In thermodynamics, a different and much simpler concept of the state of a system is in troduced. It does not need detailed knowledge of motion of each particle because, we deal with average measurable properties of the system. We specify the state of the system by **state functions** or **state variables**.

The **state** of a thermodynamic system is described by its measurable or macroscopic (bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure (\(p\)), volume (\(V\)), temperature (\(T\)), amount (\(\eta\)) etc. Variables like \(p\), \(V\), \(T\) are called **state variables** or **state functions** because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, others automatically have definitevalues.

The state of the surroundings can never be completely specified: fortunately it is not necessary to do so.

6.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State Function

When we talk about our chemical system losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, mechanical or any other type of energy you may think of, the sum of all these is the energy of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it the internal energy, \(U\)of the system, which may change, when

* heat passes in to or out of the system,
* work is done on or by the system,
* matter enters or leaves the system.

These systems are classified accordingly as you have already studied in section 6.1.2.

### Work

Let us first examine a change in internal energy by doing work. We take a system containing some quantity of water in a thermos flask or in an insulated beaker. This would not allow exchange of heat between the system and surroundings through its boundary and we call this type of system as **adiabatic**. The manner in which the state of such a system may be changed will be called adiabatic process. Adiabatic process is a process in which there is no transfer of heat between the system and surroundings. Here, the wall separating the system and the surroundings is called the adiabatic wall (Fig 6.3).

Let us bring the change in the internal energy of the system by doing some work on it. Let us call the initial state of the system as state A and its temperature as \(T_{\Lambda}\). Let the

Figure 6.3: An adiabatic system which does not permit the transfer of heat through its boundary.

internal energy of the system in state A be called \(U_{\rm a}\). We can change the state of the system in two different ways.

_One way:_ We do some mechanical work, say 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and thereby churning water. Let the new state be called B state and its temperature, as \(T_{\rm B}\). It is found that \(T_{\rm B}>T_{\rm A}\) and the change in temperature, \(\Delta T=T_{\rm B}-T_{\rm A}\). Let the internal energy of the system in state B be \(U_{\rm B}\) and the change in internal energy, \(\Delta U=U_{\rm B}-U_{\rm A}\).

_Second way:_ We now do an equal amount (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an immersion rod and note down the temperature change. We find that the change in temperature is same as in the earlier case, say, \(T_{\rm B}-T_{\rm A}\).

In fact, the experiments in the above manner were done by J. P. Joule between 1840-50 and he was able to show that a given amount of work done on the system, no matter how it was done (irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system.

So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy \(U\), whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, \(\rm w_{\rm ad}\) required to bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of \(U\) in one state and that in another state, \(\Delta U\,\).

\(\Delta U=U_{2}-U_{1}\)

Therefore, internal energy, \(U\), of the system is a state function.

The positive sign expresses that \(\rm w_{\rm ad}\) is positive when work is done on the system. Similarly, if the work is done by the system, \(\rm w_{\rm ad}\) will be negative.

Can you name some other familiar state functions? Some of other familiar state functions are \(V\), \(p\), and \(T\). For example, if we bring a change in temperature of the system from 25 C to 35 C, the change in temperature is 35 C-25 C = +10 C, whether we go straight up to 35 C or we cool the system for a few degrees, then take the system to the final temperature. Thus, \(T\) is a state function and the change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for example, is a state function, because change in volume of its water is independent of the route by which water is filled in the pond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both,

_(b) Heat_

We can also change the internal energy of a system by transfer of heat from the surroundings to the system or vice-versa without expenditure of work. This exchange of energy, which is a result of temperature difference is called heat, \(q\). Let us consider bringing about the same change in temperature (the same initial and final states as before in section 6.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through thermally conducting walls instead of adiabatic walls (Fig. 6.4).

We take water at temperature, \(T_{\rm A}\) in a container having thermally conducting walls, say made up of copper and enclose it in a huge heat reservoir at temperature, \(T_{\rm B}\). The heat absorbed by the system (water), \(q\) can be measured in terms of temperature difference, \(T_{\rm B}-T_{\rm A}\). In this case change in internal energy, \(\Delta U=q\), when no work is done at constant volume.

_The \(q\) is positive, when heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system and \(q\) is negative when heat is transferred from system to the surroundings._

_(c) The general case_

Let us consider the general case in which a change of state is brought about both by doing work and by transfer of heat. We write change in internal energy for this case as:

\[\Delta U=q\ +\ \mathrm{w} \tag{6.1}\]

For a given change in state, \(q\) and \(\mathrm{w}\) can vary depending on how the change is carried out. However, \(q\) +\(\mathrm{w}=\Delta U\) will depend only on initial and final state. It will be independent of the way the change is carried out. If there is no transfer of energy as heat or as work (isolated system) i.e., if \(\mathrm{w}=0\) and \(q=0\), then \(\Delta U=0\).

The equation 6.1 i.e., \(\Delta U=q+\mathrm{w}\) is mathematical statement of the **first law of thermodynamics**, which states that

_The energy of an isolated system is constant._

It is commonly stated as the law of conservation of energy i.e., energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.

**Note:** Thereis considerable difference between the character of the thermodynamic property energy and that of a mechanical property such as volume. We can specify an unambiguous (absolute) value for volume of a system in a particular state, but not the absolute value of the internal energy. However, we can measure only the changes in the internal energy. \(\Delta U\) of the system.

**Problem 6.1**

Express the change in internal energy of a system when

**(i)**: No heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, but work (\(\mathrm{w}\)) is done on the system. What type of wall does the system have?
**(ii)**: No work is done on the system, but \(q\) amount of heat is taken out from the system and given to the surroundings. What type of wall does the system have?
**(iii)**: w amount of work is done by the system and \(q\) amount of heat is supplied to the system. What type of system would it be?

**Solution**

**(i)**: \(\Delta U=\mathrm{w}_{\ \mathrm{ad}}\), wall is adiabatic

**(ii)**: \(\Delta U=-q\), thermally conducting walls
**(iii)**: \(\Delta U=q-\mathrm{w}\), closed system.

### Applications

Many chemical reactions involve the generation of gases capable of doing mechanical work or the generation of heat. It is important for us to quantify these changes and relate them to the changes in the internal energy. Let us see how!

#### 6.2.1 Work

First of all, let us concentrate on the nature of work a system can do. We will consider only mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.

For understanding pressure-volume work, let us consider a cylinder which contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas is \(V_{\!{}_{i}}\) and pressure of the gas inside is \(p\). If external pressure is \(p_{\mathrm{ex}}\) which is greater than \(p\), piston is moved inward till the pressure inside becomes equal to \(p_{\mathrm{ex}}\). Let this change be achieved in a single step and the final volume be \(V_{f}\). During this compression, suppose piston moves a distance, \(l\) and is cross-sectional area of the piston is A [Fig. 6.5(a)]. then, volume change = \(l\) A = \(\Delta V=(V_{f}-V_{i})\) We also know, pressure = \(\frac{\text{fo}}{\text{ar}}\) Therefore, force on the piston = \(p_{ex}\). A If w is the work done on the system by movement of the piston then w = force \(\times\) distance = \(p_{ex}\). A.l = \(p_{ex}\). (-\(\Delta V\)) = \(-p_{ex}\)\(\Delta V=-p_{ex}(V_{f}-V_{i})\) (6.2)

The negative sign of this expression is required to obtain conventional sign for w, which will be positive. It indicates that in case of compression work is done on the system. Here \((V_{f}-V_{i})\) will be negative and negative multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence the sign obtained for the work will be positive. If the pressure is not constant at every stage of compression, but changes in number of finite steps, work done on the gas will be summed over all the steps and will be equal to \(-\Sigma\)\(p\Delta V\) [Fig. 6.5 (b)]

If the pressure is not constant but changes during the process such that it is always infinitesimally greater than the pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of compression, the volume decreases by an infinitesimal amount \(dV\). In such a case we can calculate the work done on the gas by the relation \(\cdot\) w=\(-\int\limits_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}p_{\alpha}dV\) (6.3)

Here, \(p_{ex}\) at each stage is equal to (\(p_{m}+dp\)) in case of compression [Fig. 6.5(c)]. In an expansion process under similar conditions, the external pressure is always less than the pressure of the system i.e., \(p_{ex}\) = (\(p_{m}\)\(dp\)). In general case we can write, \(p_{ex}\) = (\(p_{m}\pm dp\)). Such processes are called reversible processes.

**A process or change is said to be reversible, if a change is brought out in such a way that the process could, at any moment, be reversed by an infinitesimal change. A reversible process proceeds infinitely slowly by a series of equilibrium states such that system and the surroundings are always in near equilibrium with each other. Processes**other than reversible processes are known as irreversible processes.**

In chemistry, we face problems that can be solved if we relate the work (term to the **internal pressure of the system.** We can relate work to internal pressure of the system under **reversible conditions** by writing equation 6.3 as follows:

\[\mathrm{W}_{r,w}=-\int\limits_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}p_{ex}\dot{d}\]

Since \(dp\quad dV\) is very small we can write

\[\mathrm{W}_{r,w}=-\int\limits_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}p_{m}d \tag{6.4}\]

Now, the pressure of the gas (\(p_{m}\)which we can write as \(p\) now) can be expressed in terms of its volume through gas equation. For \(n\) mol of an ideal gas i.e., \(pV=nRT\)

\[\Rightarrow p=\frac{nRT}{V}\]

Therefore, at constant temperature (isothermal process),

\[\mathrm{W}_{r,w}=-\int\limits_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}nRT\]

\[=-2.303\;nRT\log\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}} \tag{6.5}\]

_Free expansion:_ Expansion of a gas in vacuum (\(p_{ex}=0\)) is called free expansion. No work is done during free expansion of an ideal gas whether the process is reversible or irreversible (equation 6.2 and 6.3).

Now, we can write equation 6.1 in number of ways depending on the type of processes.

Let us substitute \(\mathrm{w}=-p_{ex}\Delta V\) (eq. 6.2) in equation 6.1, and we get

\[\dot{\Delta U}=q-p_{ex}\Delta V\]

If a process is carried out at constant volume (\(\Delta V=0\)), then

\[\Delta U=q_{V}\]

the subscript \(v\) in \(q_{V}\)denotes that heat is supplied at constant volume.

_Isothermal and free expansion of an ideal gas_

Forisothermal (\(T=\) constant) expansion of an ideal gas into vacuum : w = 0 since \(p_{ex}=0\). Also, Joule determined experimentally that \(q=0\); therefore, \(\Delta U=0\)

Equation 6.1, \(\Delta U=q+\mathrm{w}\) can be expressed for isothermal irreversible and reversible changes as follows:

1. For isothermal irreversible change \(q=-\mathrm{w}=p_{ex}(V_{f}\quad V_{i})\)
2. For isothermal reversible change \(q=-\mathrm{w}=nRT\;\ln\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}\)

\[=2.303\;nRT\log\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}\]
3. For adiabatic change, \(q=0\), \(\Delta U=\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{nd}}\)

**Problem 6.2**

Two litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of 10 atm expands isothermally into a vacuum until its total volume is 10 litres. How much heat is absorbed and how much work is done in the expansion?

**Solution**

We have \(q=-\mathrm{w}=p_{ex}(10-2)=0(8)=0\)

No work is done: no heat is absorbed.

**Problem 6.3**

Consider the same expansion, but this time against a constant external pressure of 1 atm.

**Solution**

We have \(q=-\mathrm{w}=p_{ex}(8)=8\) litres-atm

**Problem 6.4**

Consider the same expansion, to a final volume of 10 litres conducted reversibly.

**Solution**

We have \(q=-\mathrm{w}=2.303\quad 10\;\log\frac{10}{2}\)

= 16.1 litres-atm

### 6.2.2 Enthalpy, \(H\)

_(a) A useful new state function_

We know that the heat absorbed at constant volume is equal to change in the internal energy i.e., \(\Delta U=q_{v}\), But most of chemical reactions are carried out not at constant volume, but in flasks or test tubes under constant atmospheric pressure. We need to define another state function which may be suitable under these conditions.

We may write equation (6.1) as \(\Delta U=q_{p}-p\Delta V\) at constant pressure, where \(q_{p}\) is heat absorbed by the system and \(-p\Delta V\) represent expansion work done by the system.

Let us represent the initial state by subscript 1 and final state by 2

We can rewrite the above equation as

\[U_{2}-U_{1}=q_{p}-p\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)\]

On rearranging, we get

\[q_{p}=(U_{2}+pV_{2})-(U_{1}+pV_{1}) \tag{6.6}\]

Now we can define another thermodynamic function, the enthalpy \(H\)[Greek word enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :

\[H=U+pV \tag{6.7}\]

so, equation (6.6) becomes

\[q_{p}=H_{2}-H_{1}=\Delta H\]

Although \(q\) is a path dependent function, \(H\) is a state function because it depends on \(U\), \(p\) and \(V\), all of which are state functions. Therefore, \(\Delta H\) is independent of path. Hence, \(q_{p}\) is also independent of path.

For finite changes at constant pressure, we can write equation 6.7 as

\[\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta pV\]

Since \(p\) is constant, we can write

\[\Delta H=\Delta U+p\Delta V \tag{6.8}\]

It is important to note that when heat is absorbed by the system at constant pressure, we are actually measuring changes in the enthalpy.

Remember \(\Delta H=q_{p}\), heat absorbed by the system at constant pressure.

\(\Delta H\) is negative for exothermic reactions which evo lv heat during the reaction and AH is positive for endothermic reactions which absorb heat from the surroundings.

At constant volume (\(\Delta V=0\)), \(\Delta U=q_{v}\) therefore equation 6.8 becomes

\[\Delta H=\Delta U=q_{v}\]

The difference between \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta U\) is not usually significant for systems consisting of only solids and / or liquids. Solids and liquids do not suffer any significant volume changes upon heating. The difference, however, becomes significant when gases are involved. Let us consider a reaction involving gases. If \(V_{\rm A}\) is the total volume of the gaseous reactants, \(V_{\rm B}\) is the total volume of the gaseous products, \(n_{\rm A}\) is the number of moles of gaseous reactants and \(n_{\rm B}\) is the number of moles of gaseous products, all at constant pressure and temperature, then using the ideal gas law, we write,

\[pV_{\rm A}=n_{\rm A}RT\]

and \(pV_{\rm B}=n_{\rm B}RT\)

Thus, \(pV_{\rm B}-pV_{\rm A}=n_{\rm B}RT-n_{\rm A}RT=(n_{\rm B}-n_{\rm A})RT\)

or \(p\left(V_{\rm B}-V_{\rm A}\right)=(n_{\rm B}-n_{\rm A})RT\)

or \(p\Delta V=\Delta n_{g}RT\)

Here, \(\Delta n_{g}\) refers to the number of moles of gaseous products minus the number of moles of gaseous reactants.

Substituting the value of \(p\Delta V\) from equation 6.9 in equation 6.8, we get

\[\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{g}RT \tag{6.10}\]

The equation 6.10 is useful for calculating \(\Delta H\) from \(\Delta U\) and _vice versa_.

**Problem 6.5**

If water vapour is assumed to be a perfect gas, molarenthalpy change for vapourisation of 1 mol of water at 1bar and 100 C is 41 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). Calculate the internal energy change, when

1. 1 mol of water is vaporised at 1 bar pressure and 100 C.
2. 1 mol of water is converted into ice.

\(\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta I\) or \(\Delta U=\Delta H-\Delta n_{g}\)RT, substituting the values, we get \(\Delta U=41.00\) kJ \(\times 8.3\) J \(=41.00\) kJ \(=37.904\) kJ mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\) (ii) The change \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\to\text{H}_{2}\text{C}\) There is negligible change in volume, So, we can put \(p\Delta V=\Delta n_{g}\)RT in this case, \(\Delta H\equiv\Delta U\) so. \(\Delta U=41\). (b) Extensive and Intensive Properties In thermodynamics, a distinction is made between extensive properties and intensive properties. An **extensive property** is a property whose value depends on the quantity or size of matter present in the system. For example, mass, volume, internal energy, enthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive properties. Those properties which do not depend on the quantity or size of matter present are known as **intensive properties**. For example temperature, density, pressure etc. are intensive properties. A molar property, \(\chi_{m}\), is the value of an extensive property \(\chi\) of the system for 1 mol of the substance. If \(n\) is the amount of matter, \(\chi_{m}=\dfrac{\chi}{n}\) is independent of the amount of matter. Other examples are molar volume, \(V_{m}\) and molar heat capacity, \(C_{m}\). Let us understand the distinction between extensive and intensive properties by considering a gas enclosed in a container of volume \(V\) and at temperature \(T\) [Fig. 6.6(a)]. Let us make a partition such that volume is halved, each part [Fig. 6.6 (b)] now has one half of the original volume, \(\dfrac{V}{2}\), but the temperature will still remain the same i.e., \(T\). It is clear that volume is an extensive property and temperature is an intensive property.

### Heat Capacity

In this sub-section, let us see how to measure heat transferred to a system. This heat appears as a rise in temperature of the system in case of heat absorbed by the system.

The increase of temperature is proportional to the heat transferred

\(q=coeff\times\Delta T\)

The magnitude of the coefficient depends on the size, composition and nature of the system. We can also write it as \(q=C\Delta T\)

The coefficient, \(C\) is called the heat capacity.

Thus, we can measure the heat supplied by monitoring the temperature rise, provided we know the heat capacity.

When \(C\) is large, a given amount of heat results in only a small temperature rise, Water has a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy is needed to raise its temperature.

\(C\) is directly proportional to amount of substance. The molar heat capacity of a substance, \(C_{m}=\dfrac{\left(C\right)}{n}\), is the heat capacity for

Figure 6.6: **(a)** A \(gas\) at volume \(V\) and temperature \(T\)

Figure 6.6: **(b)** Partition, each part having half the volume of the gas

one mole of the substance and is the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole by one degree celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also called specific heat capacity is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of a substance by one degree celsius (or one kelvin). For finding out the heat, \(q\), required to raise the temperatures of a sample, we multiply the specific heat of the substance, c, by the mass m, and temperatures change, \(\Delta T\) as

\[\dot{q}=c\times m\times\Delta T \tag{6.11}\]

\((d)\) The relationship between \(C_{p}\) and \(C_{v}\) for an ideal gas

At constant volume, the heat capacity, \(C\) is denoted by \(C_{v}\)and at constant pressure, this is denoted by \(C_{p}\). Let us find the relationship between the two.

We can write equation for heat, \(q\)

at constant volume as \(q_{v}=\dot{C}_{v}\Delta T=\Delta U\)

at constant pressure as \(q_{p}=C_{p}\Delta T=\Delta H\)

The difference between \(C_{p}\) and \(C_{v}\) can be derived for an ideal gas as:

For a mole of an ideal gas, \(\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta(pV)\)

\[=\Delta U+\Delta(RT)\] \[=\Delta U+\mathrm{R}\Delta T\] \[\dot{\times}.\ \Delta H=\Delta U+1 \tag{6.12}\]

On putting the values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta U\), we have

\[\dot{C}_{p}\Delta T=C_{v}\Delta T\] \[\dot{C}_{p}=C_{v}+\mathrm{R}\] \[\dot{C}_{p}-C_{v}=\mathrm{R} \tag{6.13}\]

We can measure energy changes associated with chemical or physical processes by an experimental technique called calorimetry. In calorimetry, the process is carried out in a vessel called calorimeter, which is immersed in a known volume of a liquid. Knowing the heat capacity of the liquid in which calorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity of calorimeter, it is possible to determine the heat evolved in the process by measuring temperature changes. Measurements are made under two different conditions:

i) at constant volume, \(q_{v}\)

ii) at constant pressure, \(q_{p}\)

_(a) \(\Delta U\) measurements_

For chemical reactions, heat absorbed at constant volume, is measured in a bomb calorimeter (Fig. 6.7). Here, a steel vessel (the bomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole device is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is immersed in water bath to ensure that no heat is lost to the surroundings. A combustible substance is bumt in pure dioxygen supplied in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the reaction is transferred to the water around the bomb and its temperature is monitored. Since the bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume does not change i.e., the energy changes associated with reactions are measured at constant volume. Under these conditions, no work is

Figure 6.7: Bomb calorimeter

done as the reaction is carried out at constant volume in the bomb calorimeter. Even for reactions involving gases, there is no work done as \(\Delta V=0\). Temperature change of the calorimeter produced by the completed reaction is then converted to \(q_{v}\), by using the known heat capacity of the calorimeter with the help of equation 6.11. (b) \(\Delta H\) measurements Measurement of heat change at constant pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure) can be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 6.8. We know that \(\Delta H=q_{p}\) (at constant \(p\)) and, therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, \(q_{p}\) at constant pressure is also called the heat of reaction or enthalpy of reaction, \(\Delta H\). In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved, and system loses heat to the surroundings. Therefore, \(q_{p}\) will be negative and \(\Delta H\) will also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed, \(q_{p}\) is positive and \(\Delta H\) will be positive.

**Problem 6.6**

1g of graphite is burnt in a bomb calorimeter in excess of oxygen at 298 K and 1 atmospheric pressure according to the equation

**C** (graphite) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) (g) During the reaction, temperature rises from 298 K to 299 K. If the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter is 20.7kJ/K, what is the enthalpy change for the above reaction at 298 K and 1 atm?

**Solution**

Suppose \(q\) is the quantity of heat from the reaction mixture and \(C_{v}\) is the heat capacity of the calorimeter, then the quantity of heat absorbed by the calorimeter.

\(q=C_{v}\)\(\Delta T\)

Quantity of heat from the reaction will have the same magnitude but opposite sign because the heat lost by the system (reaction mixture) is equal to the heat gained by the calorimeter.

\(\ddot{q}=-C_{v}\times\)\(\Delta T\) =

(Here, negative sign indicates the exothermic nature of the reaction)

Thus, \(\Delta U\) for the combustion of the 1g of graphite = - 20.7 kJK-1

For combustion of 1 mol of graphite,

\(\hskip 14.226378pt\) 12.0 g mol-1

\(\hskip 14.226378pt\) 1

\(\hskip 14.226378pt\) = - 2.48 102 kJ mol-1

### Entthalpy Change, \(\Delta H\) of a Reaction - Reaction - Entthalpy

In a chemical reaction, reactants are converted into products and is represented by.

Reactants \(\rightarrow\) Products

The enthalpy change accompanying a reaction is called the reaction enthalpy. The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction, is given by the symbol \(\Delta H\)

Figure 6.8: Calorimeter for measuring heat changes at constant pressure (atmospheric pressure).

\(\Delta H=\) (sum of enthalpies of products) - (sum of enthalpies of reactants) \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{=}}\sum_{i}\)a,\(H_{produce\,is}\) (Here symbol \(\sum\) (sigma) is used for summation and a\({}_{i}\) and b\({}_{i}\) are the stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants respectively in the balanced chemical equation. For example, for the reaction \(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\) (g) + 2O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O (l) \(\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{\Delta}}\),\(H=\sum_{i}\)a\({}_{i}H_{p}\) \(=\left|H_{m}\left(\mathrm{CO_{2}},g\right)+2H_{m}\left(H_{2}O,l\right)\right|- \left|H_{m}\left(\mathrm{CH_{4}},g\right)\right|\) + 2H\({}_{m}\left(\mathrm{O_{2}},g\right)\) where \(H_{m}\) is the molar enthalpy.

Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity. Knowledge of this quantity is required when one needs to plan the heating or cooling required to maintain an industrial chemical reaction at constant temperature. It is also required to calculate temperature dependence of equilibrium constant.

_(a) Standard enthalpy of reactions_

Enthalpy of a reaction depends on the conditions under which a reaction is carried out. It is, therefore, necessary that we must specify some standard conditions. The standard enthalpy of reaction is the enthalpy change for a reaction when all the participating substances are in their standard states.

The standard state of a substance at a specified temperature is its pure form at 1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at 1 bar; standard state of solid iron at 500 K is pure iron at 1 bar. Usually data are taken at 298 K.

Standard conditions are denoted by adding the superscript V to the symbol \(\Delta H\), e.g., \(\Delta H^{\nu}\) (b) Enthalpy changes during phase transformations

Phase transformations also involve energy changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for melting. Normally this melting takes place at constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and during phase change, temperature remains constant (at 273 K).

\(\mathrm{H_{2}O(s)\to H_{2}C}\)

Here \(\Delta_{\mu\mu}H\) is enthalpy of fusion in standard state. If water freezes, then process is reversed and equal amount of heat is given off to the surroundings.

The enthalpy change that accompanies melting of one mole of a solid substance in standard state is called standard enthalpy of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion, \(\Delta_{\mu\mu}H^{\nu}\).

Melting of a solid is endothermic, so all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water requires heat for evaporation. At constant temperature of its boiling point \(T_{h}\) and at constant pressure:

\(\mathrm{H_{2}O(l)\to H_{2}O}\)

\(\Delta_{new}H\) is the standard enthalpy of vaporization.

Amount of heat required to vaporize one mole of a liquid at constant temperature and under standard pressure (1bar) is called its standard enthalpy of vaporization or molar enthalpy of vaporization, \(\Delta_{new}H^{\nu}\).

Sublimation is direct conversion of a solid into its vapour. Solid CO\({}_{2}\) or 'dry ice' sublimes at 195K with \(\Delta_{sub}H=\) 25.2 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\); naphthalene sublimes slowly and for this \(\Delta_{sub}H^{\nu}=\) 73.0.

Standard enthalpy of sublimation, \(\Delta_{sub}H\) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a solid substance sublimes at a constant temperature and under standard pressure (1bar).

The magnitude of the enthalpy change depends on the strength of the intermolecular interactions in the substance undergoing the phase transformations. For example, the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them tightly in liquid phase. For an organic liquid, such as acetone, the intermolecular 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:166]

It is important to understand that a standard molar enthalpy of formation. \(\Delta_{J}H\), is just a special case of \(\Delta H\). where one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements, as in the above three equations, where 1 mol of each, water, methane and ethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy change for an exothermic reaction:

\[\Delta_{J}H^{V}=-178\]

is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been formed from other compounds, and not from its constituent elements. Also, for the reaction given below, enthalpy change is not standard enthalpy of formation, \(\Delta_{J}H\) for HBr(g). \(\cdot\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Br\({}_{2}\)(l). Here two moles, instead of one mole of the product is formed from the elements. i.e., \(\Delta_{J}H^{V}=2\Delta_{J}H\).

Therefore, by dividing all coefficients in the balanced equation by 2, expression for enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as \(\left\langle\right\rangle_{2}H_{2}(g)+\left\langle\right\rangle_{2}B\text{r}_{2}\)

Standard enthalpies of formation of some common substances are given in Table 6.2.

By convention, standard enthalpy for formation, \(\Delta_{j}H\), of an element in reference state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation is taken as zero.

Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and want to know how much heat is required to decompose calcium carbonate to lime and carbon dioxide, with all the substances in their standard state.

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{CaCO}_{3}}(s)\to C\)

Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy of formation and calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. The following general equation can be used for the enthalpy change calculation.

\[\left\langle\right\rangle_{n}H^{\text{v}}=\sum_{i}\text{a}_{i}\text{a}_{j}H^{ \text{v}} \tag{6.15}\]

where a and b represent the coefficients of the products and reactants in the balanced equation. Let us apply the above equation for decomposition of calcium carbonate. Here, coefficients 'a' and 'b' are 1 each.

Therefore,

\[\left\langle\right\rangle_{r}H^{\text{v}}=\Delta_{j}H^{\text{v}}\text{[}\]

\[\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{I}}=\text{I}(-635.1\text{ kJ}\]

\[\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{I}}=178.3\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\]

Thus, the decomposition of CaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) is an endothermic process and you have to heat it for getting the desired products.

_(d) Thermochemical equations_

A balanced chemical equation together with the value of its \(\Delta H\) is called a thermochemical equation. We specify the physical state (alongwith allotropic state) of the substance in an equation. For example:

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{2}H_{5}OH(l)+3\)

The above equation describes the combustion of liquid ethanol at constant temperature and pressure. The negative sign of enthalpy change indicates that this is an exothermic reaction.

It would be necessary to remember the following conventions regarding thermo-chemical equations.

1. The coefficients in a balanced thermo-chemical equation refer to the number of moles (never molecules) of reactants and products involved in the reaction.
2. The numerical value of \(\Delta H\) refers to the number of moles of substances specified by an equation. Standard enthalpy change \(\Delta H\) will have units as kJ mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

To illustrate the concept, let us consider the calculation of heat of reaction for the following reaction :

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{Fe}_{2}O_{3}}(s)+3F\).

From the Table (6.2) of standard enthalpy of formation (\(\Delta_{j}H\) ), we find :

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{J}}H^{\text{v}}\left(H_{2}O_{3},l\right)=-285,83\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\);

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{J}}H^{\text{v}}\left(Fe_{2}O_{3},l\right)=-82,4.2\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\);

Also \(\Delta_{j}H^{\text{v}}\left(F\right)\)

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{J}}H^{\text{v}}\left(H\right.\)

Then,

\(\left\langle\right\rangle_{\text{A}_{j}H_{1}^{\text{v}}}=3(-285.83\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}})\)

\(-1(-824.2\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}})\)

\(=(-857.5+824.2)\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\)

\(=-33.3\text{ kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\)

Note that the coefficients used in these calculations are pure numbers, which are equal to the respective stoichiometric coefficients. The unit for \(\Delta_{j}H\) is 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:169]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:170]

\(\Delta_{f}H^{\nu}=-321\)

Consider the following example of atomization of dihydrogen

H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) 2H(g): \(\Delta_{g}H\) = 435.0 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

You can see that H atoms are formed by breaking H-H bonds in dihydrogen. The enthalpy change in this process is known as enthalpy of atomization, \(\Delta_{g}H\). It is the enthalpy change on breaking one mole of bonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas phase.

In case of diatomic molecules, like dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of atomization is also the bond dissociation enthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of atomization can be

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\to\) C(g) + 4H(g): \(\Delta_{g}H\) = 1665 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

Note that the products are only **atoms** of C and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following reaction:

Na(s) \(\to\) Na(g) : \(\Delta_{a}H\) = 108.4 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

In this case, the enthalpy of atomization is same as the enthalpy of sublimation.

_(c) Bond Enthalpy (symbol: \(\Delta_{{}_{\mathrm{ho\,ad}}H}\)\({}^{\Gamma}\))_

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds. Energy is required to break a bond and energy is released when a bond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of reaction to changes in energy associated with breaking and making of chemical bonds. With reference to the enthalpy changes associated with chemical bonds, two different terms are used in thermodynamics.

\(\Delta_{f}H^{\nu}=-321\)

Consider the following reaction:

H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) 2H(g) : \(\Delta_{{}_{\mathrm{H-H}}}H\) = 435.0 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

The enthalpy change involved in this process is the bond dissociation enthalpy of H-H bond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the change in enthalpy when one mole of covalent bonds of a gaseous covalent compound is broken to form products in the gas phase.

Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all diatomic molecules. For example:

Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) 2Cl(g) : \(\Delta_{{}_{\mathrm{C-cl}}}H\) = 242 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) 2O(g) : \(\Delta_{{}_{\mathrm{O}}}H\) = 428 kJ mol\({}^{\Gamma}\)

In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond dissociation enthalpy is different for different bonds within the same molecule.

_Polyatomic Molecules:_ Let us now consider a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH\({}_{4}\). The overall thermochemical equation for its atomization reaction is given below:

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\to\) C(g

In methane, all the four C - H bonds are identical in bond length and energy. However, the energies required to break the individual C - H bonds in each successive step differ :

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\to\) CH\({}_{3}\)(

CH\({}_{3}\)(g) \(\to\) CH\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) CH(g

CH(g) \(\to\) C(g).

Therefore,

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\to\) C(g)

In such cases we use **mean bond enthalpy of C - H bond**.

For example in CH\({}_{4}\), \(\Delta_{\text{C-H}}H\) is calculated as:

\[\Delta_{\text{C-H}}H^{\text{V}}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}\iota\\ \\ =4\,16\,\,\text{kJ mol}^{\text{-1}}\end{array}\right.\]

We find that mean C-H bond enthalpy in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been found that mean C-H bond enthalpies differ slightly from compound to compound, as in CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Cl.CF etc., butit does not differ in a great deal*. Using Hess's law, bond enthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy values of some single and multiple bonds are given in Table 6.3. The reaction enthalpies are very important quantities as these arise from the changes that accompany the breaking of old bonds and formation of the new bonds. We can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas phase, if we know different bond enthalpies. The standard enthalpy of reaction, \(\Delta H\) is related to bond enthalpies of the reactants and products in gas phase reactions as:

Footnote *: _Note that symbol used for bond dissociation enthalpy and mean bond enthalpy is the same._

\[\Delta_{\text{C}}H^{\text{V}}=\sum\text{bor}\]

\[-\sum\text{b}\]

This relationship is particularly more useful when the required values of \(\Delta_{\text{f}}H\) are not available. The net enthalpy change of a reaction is the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in the reactant molecules minus the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in the product molecules. Remember that this relationship is approximate and is valid when all substances (reactants and products) in the reaction are in gaseous state.

(d) _Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : \(\Delta_{\text{sol}}H^{\text{Q}}\) )_

Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolvesin a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy change observed on dissolving the substance in an infinite amount of solvent when the interactions between the ions (or solute molecules) are negligible.

When an ionic compound dissolves in a solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions on the crystallite. These are now more free in solution. But solvation of these ions (hydration in case solvent is water) also occurs at the same time. This is shown diagrammatically, for an ionic compound, AB (s)

The enthalpy of solution of AB(s), \(\Delta_{ss}H\), in water is, therefore, determined by the selective values of the lattice enthalpy.\(\Delta_{int,oc}H\) and enthalpy of hydration of ions, \(\Delta_{int}H\) as

For most of the ionic compounds, \(\Delta_{sol}H\) is positive and the dissociation process is endothermic. Therefore the solubility of most salts in water increases with rise of temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very high, the dissolution of the compound may not take place at all. Why do many fluorides tend to be less soluble than the corresponding chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of enthalpy changes may be made by using tables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice energies (enthalpies).

### Lattice Enthalpy

The lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is the enthalpy change which occurs when one mole of an ionic compound dissociates into its ions in gaseous state.

\(\cdot\)Na\({}^{+}\)Cl\({}^{-}\)(s)\(\rightarrow\) :

Since it is impossible to determine lattice enthalpies directly by experiment, we use an indirect method where we construct an enthalpy diagram called a Born-Haber Cycle (Fig. 6.9).

Let us now calculate the lattice enthalpy of Na\({}^{+}\)Cl(s) by following steps given below :

1. Na(s)\(\rightarrow\)Na(g). _sublimation of sodium metal_ \(\Delta_{sub}H^{\nu}=108\).
2. Na(g)\(\rightarrow\)Na\({}^{+}\)(i, the ionization of sodium atoms, ionization enthalpy \(\Delta H=496\) kJ mol \({}^{1}\)
3. \(\frac{1}{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)(g)\(\rightarrow\)Cl(, thedissociation of chlorine, the reaction enthalpy is half the bond dissociation enthalpy. \(\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{bond}H^{\rm V}=1\):.
4. Cl(g) + e\({}^{-1}\)(g) - _electron gained_ by chlorine atoms. The electron gain enthalpy, \(\Delta_{g}H=-348.6\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). You have learnt about ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy in Unit 3. In fact, these terms have been taken from thermodynamics. Earlier terms, ionization energy and electron affinity were in practice in place of the above terms (see the box for justification).

Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity Ionization energy and electron affinity are defined at absolute zero. At any other temperature, heat capacities for the reactants and the products have to be taken into account. Enthalpies of reactions for M[g] \(\rightarrow\) M'(g) + e\({}^{-}\) (for ionization) M[g] + e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightarrow\) M'(g) (for electron gain) at temperature. \(T\) is \(\Delta\),\(H\) (\(T\) ) = \(\Delta\),\(H\) (0) + \(\int\limits_{0}^{T}\Delta\),\(C_{p}^{\rm V}\)d T The value of \(C_{p}\) for each species in the above reaction is 5/2 R (\(C_{v}=3/2\)R So. \(\Delta\),\(C_{p}=+5/2\) R (for ionization) \(\Delta\),\(C_{p}=-5/2\) R (for electron gain) Therefore. \(\Delta\),\(H\) (ionization enthalpy) = \(E_{0}\) (ionization energy) + 5/2 R\(T\) (electron gain enthalpy) = - A(electron affinity) - 5/2 RT.
5. Na\({}^{+}\)(g) + Cl\({}^{-}\)(g The sequence of steps is shown in Fig. 6.9, and is known as a Born-Haber cycle. The importance of the cycle is that, the sum of the enthalpy changes round a cycle is zero. Applying Hess's law, we get, \(\Delta\),\(\Delta_{tottot}H^{\rm V}=411\) \(\Delta_{tottot}H^{\rm V}=+7\) for Na Cl(s) \(\rightarrow\) Na Internal energy is smaller by 2RT ( because \(\Delta\),\(\Delta_{g}=2\)) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy to calculate enthalpy of solution from the expression:

\(\Delta_{sol}H^{\rm V}=\Delta_{\rm int\,k}\)

For one mole of NaCl(s), lattice enthalpy = + 788 kJ mol\({}^{+}\) and \(\Delta_{tot}H=-784\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)(from the literature)

\(\Delta_{sd}H=+788\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}-784\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) = + 4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied by very little heat change.

### Spontaneity

The first law of thermodynamics tells us about the relationship between the heat absorbed and the work performed on or by a system. It puts no restrictions on the direction of heat flow. However, the flow of heat is unidirectional from higher temperature to lower temperature. In fact, all naturally occurring processes whether chemical or physical will tend to proceed spontaneously in one direction only. For example, a gas expanding to fill the available volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving carbon dioxide.

But heat will not flow from colder body to warmer body on its own, the gas in a container will not spontaneously contract into one corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many other spontaneously occurring changes show unidirectional change. We may ask 'what is the driving force of spontaneously occurring changes? What determines the direction of a spontaneous change? In this section, we shall establish some criterion for these processes whether these will take place or not.

Let us first understand what do we mean by spontaneous reaction or change? You may think by your common observation that spontaneous reaction is one which occurs immediately when contact is made between the reactants. Take the case of combination of hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may be mixed at room temperature and left for many years without observing any perceptible change. Although the reaction is taking place between them, it is at an extremely slow rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. So spontaneity means _'having the potential to proceed without the assistance of external agency'_. However, it does not tell about the rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see is that these cannot reverse their direction on their own. We may summarise it as follows:

_A sportaneous process is an irreversible process and may only be reversed by some external agency._

_(a) Is decrease in enthalpy a criterion for spontaneity?_

If we examine the phenomenon like flow of water down hill or fall of a stone on to the ground, we find that there is a net decrease in potential energy in the direction of change. By analogy, we may be tempted to state that a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a given direction, because decrease in energy has taken place, as in the case of exothermic reactions. For example:

\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{\cdot}{2}\,\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{g})+\frac{\cdot}{2} \,\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{g})=\mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{g}):\\ \Delta_{r}H\ =\ -46.1\ \mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\\ \frac{\cdot}{2}\ \,\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{g})+\frac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{C}_{2}( \mathrm{g})=\mathrm{HC1}(\mathrm{g}):\\ \Delta_{r}H\ =\ -92.32\ \mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\\ \cdot\\ \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{g})+\frac{1}{2}\ \,\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{g})\to\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}):\\ \Delta_{r}H\ =\ -285.8\ \mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\end{array}\]

The decrease in enthalpy in passing from reactants to products may be shown for any exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram as shown in Fig. 6.10(a).

Thus, the postulate that driving force for a chemical reaction may be due to decrease in energy sounds'reasonable' as the basis of evidence so far!

Now let us examine the following reactions:

\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{2}\ \,\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}( \mathrm{g})\to\mathrm{NO}_{2}(\mathrm{g}):\\ \Delta_{r}H\ =\ +33.2\ \mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\end{array}\]

Therefore, it becomes obvious that while decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory factor for spontaneity, but it is not true for all cases.

_(b) Entropy and spontaneity_

Then, what drives the spontaneous process in a given direction? Let us examine such a case in which \(\Delta H\) = 0 i.e., there is no change in enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.

Let us consider diffusion of two gases into each other in a closed container which is

Figure 6.10: (a) Enthalpy diagram for exothermic reactions

Figure 6.10: (b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic reactions

The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are represented by black dots and white dots respectively and separated by a movable partition [Fig. 6.11 (a)]. When the partition is withdrawn [Fig.6.11 (b)], the gases begin to diffuse into each other and after a period of time, diffusion will be complete.

Let us examine the process. Before partition, if we were to pick up the gas molecules from left container, we would be sure that these will be molecules of gas A and similarly if we were to pick up the gas molecules from right container, we would be sure that these will be molecules of gas B. But, if we were to pick up molecules from container when partition is removed, we are not sure whether the molecules picked are of gas A or gas B. We say that the system has become less predictable or more chaotic.

We may now formulate another postulate: in an isolated system, there is always a tendency for the systems' energy to become more disordered or chaotic and this could be a criterion for spontaneous change!

At this point, we introduce another thermodynamic function, entropy denoted as S. The above mentioned disorder is the manifestation of entropy. To form a mental picture, one can think of entropy as a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder in the system. The greater the disorder in an isolated system, the higher is the entropy. As far as a chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy change can be attributed to rearrangement of atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants to another (in the products). If the structure of the products is very much disordered than that of the reactants, there will be a resultant increase in entropy. The change in entropy accompanying a chemical reaction may be estimated qualitatively by a consideration of the structures of the species taking part in the reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure would mean increase in entropy. For a given substance, the crystalline solid state is the state of lowest entropy (most ordered). The gaseous state is state of highest entropy.

Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic distribution of energy among molecules would be through statistical method which is beyond the scope of this treatment. Other way would be to relate this process to the heat involved in a process which would make entropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy, like any other thermodynamic property such as internal energy \(U\) and enthalpy \(H\) is a state function and \(\Delta S\) is independent of path.

Whenever heat is added to the system, it increases molecular motions causing increased randomness in the system. Thus heat (\(q\)) has randomising influence on the system. Can we then equate \(\Delta S\) with \(q\)? Wait! Experience suggests us that the distribution of heat also depends on the temperature at which heat is added to the system. A system at higher temperature has greater randomness in it than one at lower temperature. Thus, temperature is the measure of average chaotic motion of particles in the system. Heat added to a system at lower temperature causes greater randomness than when the same quantity of heat is added to it at higher

Figure 6.11: Diffusion of two gases

temperature. This suggests that the entropy change is inversely proportional to the temperature. \(\Delta S\) is related with \(q\) and \(T\) for a reversible reaction as :

\[\Delta S=\frac{q_{ew}}{T} \tag{6.18}\]

The total entropy change (\(\Delta S_{total}\)) for the system and surroundings of a spontaneous process is given by

\[\Delta S_{total}=\Delta S_{gas_{tot}} \tag{6.19}\]

When a system is in equilibrium, the entropy is maximum, and the change in entropy, \(\Delta S=0\).

We can say that entropy for a spontaneous process increases till it reaches maximum and at equilibrium the change in entropy is zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can calculate the change in entropy of a reversible process by

\[\Delta S_{sys}=\frac{\cdot\cdot\cdot q_{gas_{rev}}}{T}\]

We find that both for reversible and irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under isothermal conditions, \(\Delta U=0\), but \(\Delta S_{total}\) i.e., \(\Delta S_{sys}+\Delta S_{sur}\) is not zero for irreversible process. Thus, \(\Delta U\) does not discriminate between reversible and irreversible process, whereas \(\Delta S\) does.

**Problem 6.9**:

Predict in which of the following, entropy increases/decreases :

**(i)**: A liquid crystallizes into a solid.
**(ii)**: Temperature of a crystalline solid is raised from 0 K to 115 K.
**(iii)**: 2NaHCO
**(iv)**: \(\mathrm{H_{2}}\left(g\right)\to 2\mathrm{H}\left({}_{i}\right.\)
**Solution**
**(i)**: After freezing, the molecules attain an ordered state and therefore, entropy decreases.
**(ii)**: At 0 K, the constituent particles are static and entropy is minimum. If temperature is raised to 115 K, these begin to move and oscillate about their equilibrium positions in the lattice and system becomes more disordered, therefore entropy increases.
**(iii)**: Reactant. NaHCO\({}_{3}\) is a solid and it has low entropy. Among products there are one solid and two gases. Therefore, the products represent a condition of higher entropy.
**(iv)**: Here one molecule gives two atoms i.e., number of particles increases leading to more disordered state. Two moles of H atoms have higher entropy than one mole of dihydrogen molecule.
**Problem 6.10**:

For oxidation of iron.

\[4\,\mathrm{Fe}\left(\mathrm{s}\right)+3\mathrm{O}_{2}\left\{\right.\]

entropy change is \(-549.4\) JK'mol'lat \(298\) K. Inspite of negative entropy change of this reaction, why is the reaction spontaneous?

\[\Delta H\left(\Delta H\left(\mathrm{s}\right)+\mathrm{I}\left(\mathrm{s} \right)\right)\]
**Solution**

One decides the spontaneity of a reaction by considering

\[\Delta S_{total}\left(\Delta S_{sys}+\right.\]
**For calculating**

\[\Delta S_{sur}\]

, we have to consider the heat absorbed by the surroundings which is equal to \[-\Delta H\]. At temperature T, entropy change of the surroundings is \[\Delta S_{sur}=-\frac{\Delta H}{T}\]

\[=-\frac{\left(-1648\times\mathrm{I}\left.\mathrm{I}\right.\mathrm{I}\right. \mathrm{I}}{29}\]

\[=55\,30\,\mathrm{JK}^{-1}\mathrm{m}\]

Thus, total entropy change for this reaction 

### (6.3) Gibbs energy and spontaneity

We have seen that for a system, it is the total entropy change, \(\Delta S_{max}\) which decides the spontaneity of the process. But most of the chemical reactions fall into the category of either closed systems or open systems. Therefore, for most of the chemical reactions there are changes in both enthalpy and entropy. It is clear from the discussion in previous sections that neither decrease in enthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can determine the direction of spontaneous change for these systems.

For this purpose, we define a new thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy or Gibbs function, \(G\), as

\[G\ H\ TS \tag{6.20}\]

Gibbs function, \(G\) is an extensive property and a state function.

The change in Gibbs energy for the system, \(\Delta G_{sys}\) can be written as

\[\Delta G_{sys}=\Delta H_{sys}\.\]

At constant temperature, \(\Delta T=0\)

\[\therefore\Delta G_{sys}=\Delta H_{s_{\mathrm{J}}}\]

Usually the subscript'system' is dropped and we simply write this equation as

\[\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S \tag{6.21}\]

Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy change - temperature entropy change, and is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of the most important equations in chemistry. Here, we have considered both terms together for spontaneity: energy (in terms of \(\Delta H\)) and entropy (\(\Delta S\), a measure of disorder) as indicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse, we find that \(\Delta G\) has units of energy because, both \(\Delta H\) and the \(T\Delta S\) are energy terms, since \(T\Delta S\) = [K] (J/K) = J.

Now let us consider how \(\Delta G\) is related to reaction spontaneity.

We know,

\[\Delta S_{max}=\Delta S_{sys}+\Delta S_{sur}\]

If the system is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding, then the temperature of the surrounding is same as that of the system. Also, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding is equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the system.

Therefore, entropy change of surroundings,

\[\Delta S_{sur}=\frac{\Delta H_{sun}}{T}\]

\[\therefore\Delta S_{scat}=\Delta S_{sys}\]

Rearranging the above equation:

\[T\Delta S_{scat}=T\Delta S_{sys}-\Delta H_{sys}\.\]

For spontanious process, \(\Delta S_{scat}>0\), so

\[T\Delta S_{sys}-\Delta H_{sys}\textgreater 0\]

\[\therefore-\left(\Delta H_{sys}-T\right.\]

Using equation 6.21, the above equation can be written as

\[\therefore\Delta G>0\]

\[\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta \tag{6.22}\]

\(\Delta H_{sys}\) is the enthalpy change of a reaction, \(T\Delta S_{sys}\) is the energy which is not available to do useful work. So \(\Delta G\) is the net energy available to do useful work and is thus a measure of the 'free energy'. For this reason, it is also known as the free energy of the reaction.

\(\Delta G\) gives a criteria for spontaneity at constant pressure and temperature.

If \(\Delta G\) is negative (\(<0\)), the process is spontaneous.

If \(\Delta G\) is positive (\(>0\)), the process is non spontaneous.

**Note :** If a reaction has a positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change, it can be spontaneous when \(T\Delta S\) is large enough to outweigh \(\Delta H\). This can happen in two ways:(a) The positive entropy change of the system can be'small' in which case \(T\) must be large. (b) The positive entropy change of the system can be 'large', in which case \(T\) may be small. The former is one of the reasons why reactions are often carried out at high temperature. Table 6.4 summarises the effect of temperature on spontaneity of reactions.

6.7 GIBBS ENERGY CHANGE AND EQUILIBRIUM

We have seen how a knowledge of the sign and magnitude of the free energy change of a chemical reaction allows:

(i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the chemical reaction.

(ii) Prediction of the useful work that could be extracted from it,

So far we have considered free energy changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now examine the free energy changes in reversible reactions.

'Reversible' under strict thermodynamic sense is a special way of carrying out a process such that system is at all times in perfect equilibrium with its surroundings. When applied to a chemical reaction, the term'reversible' indicates that a given reaction can proceed in either direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic equilibrium is set up. This means that the reactions in both the directions should proceed with a decrease in free energy, which seems impossible. It is possible only if at equilibrium the free energy of the system is minimum. If it is not, the system would spontaneously change to configuration of lower free energy.

So, the criterion for equilibrium

A + B C + I : is

\(\Delta\),\(G\) = 0

Gibbs energy for a reaction in which all reactants and products are in standard state, \(\Delta\),\(G\) is related to the equilibrium constant of the reaction as follows:

0 = \(\Delta\),\(G\) + RT \(\ln\)\(K\)

or \(\Delta\),\(G\) = - RT \(\ln\)\(K\)

or \(\Delta\),\(G\) = - 2.303 RT \(\log\)\(K\)

We also know that

\(\Delta\),\(G^{V}\) = \(\Delta\),\(H^{V}\) -

For strongly endothermic reactions, the value of \(\Delta\)\(H\) may be large and positive. In such a case, value of \(K\) will be much smaller than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to form much product. In case of exothermic reactions, \(\Delta\),\(H\) is large and negative, and \(\Delta\),\(G\) is likely to be large and negative too. In such cases, \(K\) will be much larger than 1. We may expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a large \(K\), and hence can go to near completion, \(\Delta\),\(G\) also depends upon \(\Delta\), if the changes in the entropy of reaction is also taken into account, the value of \(K\) or extent of chemical reaction will also be affected, depending upon whether \(\Delta\),\(S\) is positive or negative.

Table 6.4 Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity of Reactions

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c|} \hline \(\Delta\),\(H\) & \(\Delta\),\(S\) & \(\Delta\),\(G\) & Description* \\ \hline - & + & - & Reaction spontaneous at all temperature \\ - & - & - (at low \(T\) ) & Reaction spontaneous at low temperature \\ - & - & + (at high \(T\) ) & Reaction nonspontaneous at high temperature \\ + & + & + (at low \(T\) ) & Reaction nonspontaneous at low temperature \\ + & + & - (at high \(T\) ) & Reaction spontaneous at high temperature \\ + & - & + (at all \(T\) ) & Reaction nonspontaneous at all temperatures \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* _The term low temperature and high temperature are relative. For a particular reaction, high temperature could even mean room temperature._

Using equation (6.24),
* It is possible to obtain an estimate of \(\Delta G^{\rm v}\) from the measurement of \(\Delta H^{\rm v}\) and \(\Delta S^{\rm v}\), and then calculate \(K\) at any temperature for economic yields of the products.
* If \(K\) is measured directly in the laboratory, value of \(\Delta G\) at any other temperature can be calculated.

**Problem 6.11**

**Calculate \(\Delta G\) for conversion of oxygen to ozone, 3/2 O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) O\({}_{3}\)(g) at 298 K. If \(K_{p}\) for this conversion is 2.47 10-29. Solution**

We know \(\Delta G=-2.303\) RT log \(K_{p}\) and R = 8.314 JK-1 mol-1 Therefore, \(\Delta G=-2.303\) (8.314 J K-1 mol-1) (298 K) (log 2.47 10-29) = 163000 J mol-1 = 163 kJ mol-1 **Problem 6.12**

\(x_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}=\frac{1-0.5}{1+0.5}\) ; \(x_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}=\frac{2\times 0.5}{1+0.5}\)

\(p_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}=\frac{0.5}{1.5}\times 1\) atm, \(P_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}=\)

\(\frac{1}{1.5}\times 1\) atm. The equilibrium constant \(K_{p}\) is given by

\(K_{p}=\frac{\left(p_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}\right)^{2}}{p_{{}_{N_{2}O_{4}}}}=\frac{ 1}{1.5}\)

= 1.33 atm. Since

\(\Delta G=-\)RT ln \(K_{p}\)

\(\Delta G=(-8.314\) JK-1 mol-1) (333 K) (2.303) (0.1239)

= 763.8 kJ mol-1

## Summary

Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution or absorption of heat (\(d\)), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related through the first law of thermodynamics via \(\Delta U=q+w\). \(\Delta U\), change in internal energy, depends on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas \(q\) and w depend on the path and are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of \(q\) and w by giving the positive sign to these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is \(q=\Delta T\). Work can be measured by \(w=-p_{\alpha}\Delta V\), in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we can put \(p_{\alpha}=p\) for infinitesimal changes in the volume making \(w_{\rm{m}}=-p\)\(dV\). In this condition, we can use gas equation, \(pV=nRT\).

At constant volume, w = 0, then \(\Delta U=q_{v}\), heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy. Enthalpy change, \(\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{g}RT\), can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, \(\Delta H=q_{v}\).

There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be calculated using Hess's law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by

\(\Delta_{i}H=\sum_{j}(a\Delta_{j}H\)

and in gaseous state by

\(\Delta H=\sum bond\) _ enthalpies of the reactants - \(\sum bond\) _ enthalpies of the products_

First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems, \(\Delta U=0\). We define another state function, S, **entropy** for this purpose. **Entropy** is a measure of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive. Therefore, for an isolated system, \(\Delta U=0,\Delta S>0\), so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation \(\Delta S=\frac{q_{\rm{m}}}{T}\) for a reversible process, \(\frac{q_{\rm{m}}}{T}\) is independent of path,

Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function **Gibbs energy**, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:

\(\Delta_{i}G=\Delta_{i}H-T\Delta S\)

For a spontaneous change, \(\Delta G_{\rm{sys}}<0\) and at equilibrium, \(\Delta G_{\rm{sys}}=0\).

Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by

\(\Delta_{i}G=-RT\ln K\)

K can be calculated from this equation, if we know \(\Delta_{i}G\) which can be found from

\(\Delta_{i}G^{\rm{v}}=\Delta_{i}H^{\rm{v}}-T\). Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems having positive entropy of reaction.

## Chapter 7 Equilibrium

1 Chemical equilibria are important in numerous biological and environmental processes. For example, equilibria involving O\({}_{2}\) molecules and the protein hemoglobin play a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O\({}_{2}\) from our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO molecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.

When a liquid evaporates in a closed container, molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape the liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of liquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid surface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise to a constant vapour pressure because of an _equilibrium_ in which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the number returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that the system has reached _equilibrium state_ at this stage. However, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of activity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. Thus, at _equilibrium_, the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation. It may be represented by

H\({}_{2}\)O (J) - H\({}_{2}\)O (vap)

The double half arrows indicate that the processes in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an _equilibrium mixture_.

Equilibrium can be established for both physical processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be fast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and the nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed vessel at a particular temperature react to give products, the concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, while those of products keep on increasing for some time after which there is no change in the concentrations of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the system is the _dynamic equilibrium_ and the rates of the forward andreverse reactions become equal. It is due to this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is no change in the concentrations of various species in the reaction mixture. Based on the extent to which the reactions proceed, the state of chemical equilibrium in a chemical reaction may be classified in three groups.
* The reactions that proceed nearly to completion and only negligible concentrations of the reactants are left. In some cases, it may not be even possible to detect these experimentally.
* The reactions in which only small amounts of products are formed and most of the reactants remain unchanged at equilibrium stage.
* The reactions in which the concentrations of the reactants and products are comparable, when the system is in equilibrium.

The extent of a reaction in equilibrium varies with the experimental conditions such as concentrations of reactants, temperature, etc. Optimisation of the operational conditions is very important in industry and laboratory so that equilibrium is favorable in the direction of the desired product. Some important aspects of equilibrium involving physical and chemical processes are dealt in this unit along with the equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solutions which is called as _ionic equilibrium_.

### 7.1 Equilibrium in Physical Processes

The characteristics of system at equilibrium are better understood if we examine some physical processes. The most familiar examples are _phase transformation processes_. e.g., solid liquid liquid liquid gas solid gas

#### 7.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium

Ice and water kept in a perfectly insulated thermos flask (no exchange of heat between its contents and the surroundings) at 273K and the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium state and the system shows interesting characteristic features. We observe that the mass of ice and water do not change with time and the temperature remains constant. However, the equilibrium is not static. The intense activity can be noticed at the boundary between ice and water. Molecules from the liquid water collide against ice and adhere to it and some molecules of ice escape into liquid phase. There is no change of mass of ice and water, as the rates of transfer of molecules from ice into water and of reverse transfer from water into ice are equal at atmospheric pressure and 273 K.

It is obvious that ice and water are in equilibrium only at particular temperature and pressure. _For any pure substance at atmospheric pressure, the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are at equilibrium is called the normal melting point or normal freezing point of the substance._ The system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we can infer the following:

* Both the opposing processes occur simultaneously.
* Both the processes occur at the same rate so that the amount of ice and water remains constant.

#### 7.1.2 Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium

This equilibrium can be better understood if we consider the example of a transparent box carrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer). Drying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride (or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for a few hours in the box. After removing the drying agent by tilting the box on one side, a watch glass (or petri dish) containing water is quickly placed inside the box. It will be observed that the mercury level in the right limb of the manometer slowly increases and finally attains a constant value, that is, the pressure inside the box increases and reaches a constant value. Also the volume of water in the watch glass decreases (Fig. 7.1). Initially there was no water vapour (or very less) inside the box. As water evaporated the pressure in the box increased due to addition of water 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:187]

#### 7.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution of Solid or Gases in Liquids

_Solids in liquids_

We know from our experience that we can dissolve only a limited amount of salt or sugar in a given amount of water at room temperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup solution by dissolving sugar at a higher temperature, sugar crystals separate out if we cool the syrup to the room temperature. We call it a saturated solution when no more of solute can be dissolved in it at a given temperature. The concentration of the solute in a saturated solution depends upon the temperature. In a saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium exits between the solute molecules in the solid state and in the solution: Sugar (solution) Sugar (solid), and the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of crystallisation of sugar.

Equality of the two rates and dynamic nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some radioactive sugar into saturated solution of non-radioactive sugar, then after some time radioactivity is observed both in the solution and in the solid sugar. Initially there were no radioactive sugar molecules in the solution but due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, there is exchange between the radioactive and non-radioactive sugar molecules between the two phases. The ratio of the radioactive to non-radioactive molecules in the solution increases till it attains a constant value.

_Gases in liquids_

When a soda water bottle is opened, some of the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes out rapidly. The phenomenon arises due to difference in solubility of carbon dioxide at different pressures. There is equilibrium between the molecules in the gaseous state and the molecules dissolved in the liquid under pressure i.e.,

CO2(gas) CO2(in solution)

This equilibrium is governed by Henry's law, **which states that the mass of a gas dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at any temperature is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solvent.** This amount decreases with increase of temperature. The soda water bottle is sealed under pressure of gas when its solubility in water is high. As soon as the bottle is opened, some of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas escapes to reach a new equilibrium condition required for the lower pressure, namely its partial pressure in the atmosphere. This is how the soda water in bottle when left open to the air for some time, turns 'flat'. It can be generalised that:

1. For solid'liquid equilibrium, there is only one temperature (melting point) at 1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two phases can coexist. If there is no exchange of heat with the surroundings, the mass of the two phases remains constant.
2. For liquid vapour equilibrium, the vapour pressure is constant at a given temperature.
3. For dissolution of solids in liquids, the solubility is constant at a given temperature.
4. For dissolution of gases in liquids, the concentration of a gas in liquid is proportional to the pressure (concentration) of the gas over the liquid. These observations are summarised in Table 7.1

\begin{tabular}{|l l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{**Process**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Conclusion**} \\ \hline Liquid & Vapour & P\({}_{n,\rho}\) constant at given \\ H\({}_{2}\)O (l) & H\({}_{2}\)O (g) & temperature \\ \hline Solid & Liquid & Melting point is fixed at \\ H\({}_{2}\)O (s) & H\({}_{2}\)O (l) & constant pressure \\ \hline Solute(s) & Solute & Concentration of solute \\ Sugar(s) & Sugar & in solution is constant \\  & (solution) & at a given temperature \\ \hline Gas(g) & Gas (aq) & [gas(aq)]/[gas(g)] is \\  & & constant at a given \\ CO2(g) & CO2(aq) & [CO2(aq)]/[CO2(g)] is \\  & & constant at a given \\  & & temperature \\ \hline \end{tabular}

		* 7.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria Involving Physical Processes For the physical processes discussed above, following characteristics are common to the system at equilibrium:
* Equilibrium is possible only in a closed system at a given temperature.
* Both the opposing processes occur at the same rate and there is a dynamic but stable condition.
* All measurable properties of the system remain constant.
* When equilibrium is attained for a physical process, it is characterised by constant value of one of its parameters at a given temperature. Table 7.1 lists such quantities.
* The magnitude of such quantities at any stage indicates the extent to which the reaction has proceeded before reaching equilibrium.
	* 7.2 Equilibria in Chemical PROCESSES - DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM Analogous to the physical systems chemical reactions also attain a state of equilibrium. These reactions can occur both in forward and backward directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal, the concentrations of the reactants and the products remain constant. This is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This equilibrium is _dynamic_ in nature as it consists of a _forward_ reaction in which the reactants give product(s) and _reverse_ reaction in which product(s) gives the original reactants. For a better comprehension, let us consider a general case of a reversible reaction. A+B^C+D With passage of time, there is accumulation of the products C and D and depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 7.2). This leads to a decrease in the rate of forward reaction and an increase in he rate of the reverse reaction, Eventually, the two reactions occur at the same rate and the system reaches a state of equilibrium.

Similarly, the reaction can reach the state of equilibrium even if we start with only C and D; that is, no A and B being present initially, as the equilibrium can be reached from either direction.

The dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium can be demonstrated in the synthesis of ammonia by Haber's process. In a series of experiments, Haber started with known amounts of dinitrogen and dihydrogen maintained at high temperature and pressure and at regular intervals determined the amount of ammonia present. He was successful in determining also the concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and dinitrogen. Fig. 7.4 (page 191) shows that after a certain time the composition of the mixture remains the same even though some of the reactants are still present. This constancy in composition indicates that the reaction has reached equilibrium. In order to understand the dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis of ammonia is carried out with exactly the same starting conditions (of partial pressure and temperature) but using D\({}_{2}\) (deuterium) in place of H\({}_{2}\). The reaction mixtures starting either with H\({}_{2}\) or D\({}_{2}\) reach equilibrium with the same composition, except that D\({}_{2}\) and ND\({}_{3}\) are present instead of H\({}_{2}\) and NH\({}_{3}\). After equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures

**Dynamic Equilibrium - A Student's Activity**

Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.

Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty.

Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1. close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant.

If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of level' of coloured water with 'concentration' of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder [2] is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning

**Figure 7.3**: Demonstrating dynamic nature of equilibrium (a) initial stage (b) final stage after the equilibrium is attained.

(H\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{3}\) and D\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\), ND\({}_{3}\)) are mixed together and left for a while. Later, when this mixture is analysed, it is found that the concentration of ammonia is just the same as before. However, when this mixture is analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found that ammonia and all deuterium containing forms of ammonia (NH\({}_{3}\), NH\({}_{2}\)D, NHD\({}_{2}\) and ND\({}_{3}\)) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms (H\({}_{2}\), HD and D\({}_{2}\)) are present. Thus one can conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in the molecules must result from a continuation of the forward and reverse reactions in the mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped when they reached equilibrium, then there would have been no mixing of isotopes in this way.

Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation of ammonia clearly indicates that **chemical reactions reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in which the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal and there is no net change in composition**.

Equilibrium can be attained from both sides, whether we start reaction by taking, H\({}_{2}\)(g) and N\({}_{2}\)(g) and get NH\({}_{3}\)(g) or by taking NH\({}_{3}\)(g) and decomposing it into N\({}_{2}\)(g) and H\({}_{2}\)(g).

\(\rm N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)\)\(\rm N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)\)

Similarly let us consider the reaction, H\({}_{2}\)(g) + I\({}_{2}\)(g) 2HI(g). If we start with equal initial concentration of H\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\), the reaction proceeds in the forward direction and the concentration of H\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\) decreases while that of HI increases, until all of these become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 7.5). We can also start with HI alone and make the reaction to proceed in the reverse direction: the concentration of HI will decrease and concentration of H\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\) will increase until they all become constant when equilibrium is reached (Fig.7.5). If total number of H and I atoms are same in a given volume, the same equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we start it from pure reactants or pure product.

### 7.3 Law of Chemical Equilibrium and Equilibrium Constant

A mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium mixture. In this section we shall address a number of important questions about the composition of equilibrium mixtures: What is the relationship between the concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture? How can we determine equilibrium concentrations from initial concentrations?

Figure 7.4: Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction \(\rm N_{2}\left(g\right)+3H_{2}\left(t\right.\)

Figure 7.5: Chemical equilibrium in the reaction \(H_{2}\left(g\right)+I_{2}\left(g\right)\) 2HI(g) can be attained from either direction

What factors can be exploited to alter the composition of an equilibrium mixture? The last question in particular is important when choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial chemicals such as H2, NH3, CaO etc.

To answer these questions, let us consider a general reversible reaction:

A + B C + D

where A and B are the reactants, C and D are the products in the balanced chemical equation. On the basis of experimental studies of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the concentrations in an equilibrium mixture are related by the following equilibrium equation,

\[K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{C}\right]\left[\text{D}\right]}{\left[\text{A} \right]\left[\text{B}\right]} \tag{7.1}\]

where \(K_{c}\) is the _equilibrium constant_ and the expression on the right side is called the _equilibrium constant expression_.

The equilibrium equation is also known as the _law of mass action_ because in the early days of chemistry, concentration was called "active mass". In order to appreciate their work better, let us consider reaction between gaseous H2 and L2 carried out in a sealed vessel at 731K.

H2(g) + L2(g) 2HI(g) 1 mol 1 mol 2 mol

Table 7.2 Initial and Equilibrium Concentrations of H2, I2 and HI

Six sets of experiments with varying initial conditions were performed, starting with only gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed taking different concentrations of H2 and / or I2, and with time it was observed that intensity of the purple colour remained constant and equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was attained from the opposite direction.

Data obtained from all six sets of experiments are given in Table 7.2.

It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted = % (number of moles of HI formed). Also, experiments 5 and 6 indicate that.

Knowing the above facts, in order to establish a relationship between concentrations of the reactants and products, several combinations can be tried. Let us consider the simple expression,

\[\left[\text{HI}\left(\text{g}\right)\right]_{\text{eq}}/\left[\text{H}_{2} \left(\text{g}\right)\right]_{\text{eq}}\left[\text{I}_{2}\left(\text{g} \right)\right]_{\text{eq}}\]

It can be seen from Table 7.3 that if we put the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, the above expression 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:193]

\[\text{nH}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{nI}_{2}(\text{g})\cdot\text{2nHI}(\text{g}) \tag{7.11}\]

Therefore, equilibrium constant for the reaction is equal to \(K_{c}^{n}\). These findings are summarised in Table 7.4. It should be noted that because the equilibrium constants \(K_{c}\) and \(K_{c}^{{}^{\prime}}\) have different numerical values, it is important to specify the form of the balanced chemical equation when quoting the value of an equilibrium constant.

Since [CaCO3(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both constant, therefore modified equilibrium constant for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate will be

\[K_{c}=\left[\text{CO}_{2}\text{(g)}\right] \tag{7.17}\]

or \(K_{p}=p_{co_{q}}\) (7.18)

This shows that a particular temperature, there is a constant concentration or pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaO(s) and CaCO(s). Experimentally it has been found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaCO(s) and CaO(s), is 2.0 10\({}^{5}\) Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant at 1100K for the above reaction is:

\[K_{p}=p_{co_{q}}=2\]

Similarly, in the equilibrium between nickel, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl (used in the purification of nickel),

Ni(s)+4CO(g).Ni(CO)4(g),

the equilibrium constant is written as

\[K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{Ni(CO)}\right]}{\left[\text{CO}\right]^{4}}\]

It must be remembered that in heterogeneous equilibrium pure solids or liquids must be present (however small it may be) for the equilibrium to exist, but their concentrations or partial pressure do not appear in the expression of the equilibrium constant. In the reaction,

\[\text{Ag}_{2}\text{O(s)+2HNO}_{3}\text{(aq)}\quad\text{2AgNO}_{3}\text{(aq)+ H}_{2}\text{O(l)}\]

\[K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{AgNO}_{3}\right.\]

**Problem 7.6**

The value of \(K_{p}\) for the reaction,

CO2(g)+C(s)=2CO(g) is3.0at1000 K. If initially

\(p_{co_{q}}=0.48\) bar and \(p_{co}=0\) bar and pure

graphite is present, calculate the

equilibrium partial pressures of CO and

CO2.

**Solution**

For the reaction,

let'x' be the amount of CO2 reacted, then

CO2(g)+C(s)^2CO(g)

Initial

pressure: 0.48 bar 0* The equilibrium constant \(K\) for a reaction is related to the equilibrium constant of the corresponding reaction, whose equation is obtained by multiplying or dividing the equation for the original reaction by a small integer.

Let us consider applications of equilibrium constant to:

* predict the extent of a reaction on the basis of its magnitude,
* predict the direction of the reaction, and
* calculate equilibrium concentrations.

#### 7.6.1 Predicting the Extent of a Reaction

The numerical value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction indicates the extent of the reaction. But it is important to note that an equilibrium does not give any information about the _rate_ at which the equilibrium is reached. The magnitude of \(K_{e}\) or \(K_{p}\) is directly proportional to the concentrations of products (as these appear in the numerator of equilibrium constant expression) and inversely proportional to the concentrations of the reactants (these appear in the denominator). This implies that a high value of \(K\) is suggestive of a high concentration of products and vice-versa.

We can make the following generalisations concerning the composition of equilibrium mixtures:

* If \(K_{e}>10^{3}\), products predominate over reactants, i.e., if \(K_{e}\) is very large, the reaction proceeds nearly to completion. Consider the following examples:
* The reaction of H\({}_{2}\) with O\({}_{2}\) at 500 K has a very large equilibrium c o n s t a t, \(K_{e}=2.4\) 10\({}^{47}\).
* H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) 2 HCl(g) at 300K has \(K_{e}=4.0\) 10\({}^{31}\).
* H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Br\({}_{2}\)(g) 2 HBr (g) at 300 K. \(K_{e}=5.4\) 10\({}^{18}\)
* If \(K_{e}<10^{3}\), reactants predominate over products, i.e., if \(K_{e}\) is very small, the reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the following examples:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:199]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:200]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:201]

to products while minimizing the expenditure of energy. This implies maximum yield of products at mild temperature and pressure conditions. If it does not happen, then the experimental conditions need to be adjusted. For example, in the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2, the choice of experimental conditions is of real economic importance. Annual world production of ammonia is about hundred million tones, primarily for use as fertilizers.

Equilibrium constant, \(K\), is independent of initial concentrations. But if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in the concentration of one or more of the reacting substances, then the system is no longer at equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in some direction until the system returns to equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change in temperature or pressure of the system may also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide what course the reaction adopts and _make a qualitative prediction_ about the effect of a change in conditions on equilibrium we use _Le Chatelier's principle_. It states that a change in any of the factors that determine the equilibrium conditions of a system will cause the system to change in such a manner so as to reduce or to counteract the effect of the change. _This is applicable to all physical and chemical equilibria_.

We shall now be discussing factors which can influence the equilibrium.

#### Effect of Concentration Change

In general, when equilibrium is disturbed by the addition/removal of any reactant/products, Le Chatelier's principle predicts that:

* The concentration stress of an _added_ reactant/product is relieved by net reaction in the direction that consumes the added substance.
* The concentration stress of a _removed_ reactant/product is relieved by net reaction in the direction that _replenishes_ the removed substance.
* or in other words,

"_When the concentration of any of the reactants or products in a reaction at equilibrium is changed, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes so as to minimize the effect of concentration changes_".

Let us take the reaction,

\(H_{2}(g)+I_{2}(g)\) 2HI(g)

If H2 is added to the reaction mixture at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein H2 is consumed, i.e., more of H2 and I2 react to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right (forward) direction (Fig.7.8). This is in accordance with the Le Chatelier's principle which implies that in case of addition of a reactant/product, a new equilibrium will be set up in which the concentration of the reactant/product should be less than what it was after the addition but more than what it was in the original mixture.

The same point can be explained in terms of the reaction quotient, \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\),

\(\mathcal{G}_{c}=[\text{HI}]^{2}/\left[H_{2}\right][\text{I}_{2}]\)

Figure 7.8: Effect of addition of H2 on change of concentration for the reactants and products in the reaction. H2(g) + I2 (g) 2HI(g)

Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium results in value of \(Q_{c}\) being less than \(K_{c}\). Thus. in order to attain equilibrium again reaction moves in the forward direction. Similarly, we can say that removal of a product also boosts the forward reaction and increases the concentration of the products and this has great commercial application in cases of reactions, where the product is a gas or a volatile substance. In case of manufacture of ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed from the reaction mixture so that reaction keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, in the large scale production of CaO (used as important building material) from CaCO\({}_{3}\), constant removal of CO\({}_{2}\) from the kiln drives the reaction to completion. It should be remembered that continuous removal of a product maintains \(Q_{c}\) at a value less than \(K_{c}\) and reaction continues to move in the forward direction.

_Effect of Concentration - An experiment_

This can be demonstrated by the following reaction:

\[\text{Fe}^{3+}\text{(aq)}+\text{SCN (aq)}\quad\text{[Fe(SCN)]}^{2+}\text{(aq)} \tag{7.24}\]

yellow colourless deep red

\[K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{Fe('}\right. \tag{7.25}\]

A reddish colour appears on adding two drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocyanate solution to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]\({}^{2+}\). The intensity of the red colour becomes constant on attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be shifted in either forward or reverse directions depending on our choice of adding a reactant or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted in the opposite direction by adding reagents that remove Fe\({}^{3+}\) or SCNions. For example, oxalic acid (H\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)), reacts with Fe\({}^{3+}\) ions to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\))\({}_{3}\)]\({}^{3-}\), thus decreasing the concentration of free Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier's principle, the concentration stress of removed Fe\({}^{3+}\) is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]\({}^{2+}\) to replenish the Fe\({}^{3+}\) ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]\({}^{2+}\) decreases. the intensity of red colour decreases.

Addition of aq. HgCl\({}_{2}\) also decreases red colour because Hg\({}^{2+}\) reacts with SCN ions to form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)]\({}^{2-}\). Removal of free SCN (aq) shifts the equilibrium in equation (7.24) from right to left to replenish SCN ions. Addition of potassium thiocyanate on the other hand increases the colour intensity of the solution as it shift the equilibrium to right.

#### 7.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change

A pressure change obtained by changing the volume can affect the yield of products in case of a gaseous reaction where the total number of moles of gaseous reactants and total number of moles of gaseous products are different. In applying Le Chatelier's principle to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of pressure changes on solids and liquids can be ignored because the volume (and concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly independent of pressure.

Consider the reaction.

\[\text{CO(g)}+\text{3H}_{2}\text{(g)}\quad\text{CH}_{4}\text{(g)}+\text{H}_{2} \text{O(g)}\]

Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H\({}_{2}\)) become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH\({}_{4}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston at constant temperature is compressed to one half of its original volume. Then, total pressure will be doubled (according to \(pV=\text{constant}\)). The partial pressure and therefore, concentration of reactants and products have changed and the mixture is no longer at equilibrium. The direction in which the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier's principle. Since pressure has doubled, the equilibrium now shifts in the forward direction. a direction in which the number of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we know pressure is proportional to moles of the gas). This can also be understood by using reaction quotient, \(Q_{c}\). Let [CO], [H\({}_{2}\)], [CH\({}_{4}\)] and [H\({}_{2}\)O] be the molar concentrations at equilibrium for methanation reaction. Whenvolume of the reaction mixture is halved, the partial pressure and the concentration are doubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by replacing each equilibrium concentration by double its value... As, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction. In reaction C(s) + CO_g(g) 2CO(g), when pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the reverse direction because the number of moles of gas increases in the forward direction.

#### 7.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition

If the volume is kept constant and an inert gas such as argon is added which does not take part in the reaction, the equilibrium remains undisturbed. It is because the addition of an inert gas at constant volume does not change the partial pressures or the molar concentrations of the substance involved in the reaction. The reaction quotient changes only if the added gas is a reactant or product involved in the reaction.

#### 7.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change

Whenever an equilibrium is disturbed by a change in the concentration, pressure or volume, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes because the reaction quotient, no longer equals the equilibrium constant,. However, when a change in temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium constant, is changed.

In general, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant depends on the sign of  for the reaction.

* The equilibrium constant for an exothermic reaction (negative ) decreases as the temperature increases.
* The equilibrium constant for an endothermic reaction (positive ) increases as the temperature increases. Temperature changes affect the equilibrium constant and rates of reactions.

Production of ammonia according to the reaction,

\(\mathrm{N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)}\) 2NH_3(g) :

\(\Delta H\)= - 92.38 kJ mol-1

is an exothermic process. According to Le Chatelier's principle, raising the temperature shifts the equilibrium to left and decreases the equilibrium concentration of ammonia. In other words, low temperature is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but practically very low temperatures slow down the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.

Effect of Temperature - An experiment

Effect of temperature on equilibrium can be demonstrated by taking NO_2 gas (brown in colour) which dimerises into gas (colourless).

\(\mathrm{2NO_{2}(g)}\) \(\mathrm{N_{2}O_{4}(g)}\); \(\Delta H\) = -57.2 kJ mol-1

\(\mathrm{NO_{2}}\) gas prepared by addition of Cu turnings to conc. HNO_3 is collected in two 5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity of colour of gas in each tube) and stopper sealed with anadlite. Three 250 mL leakers 1, 2 and 3 containing freezing mixture, water at room temperature and hot water (363K), respectively, are taken (Fig. 7.9). Both the test tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the other in beaker 3. The effect of temperature on direction of reaction is depicted very well in this experiment. At low temperatures in beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, and thus, intensity of brown colour due to decreases. While in beaker 3, high temperature favours the reverse reaction of formation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour intensifies.

Effect of temperature can also be seen in an endothermic reaction,

[Co(H2O)]^2+(aq)+4Cl (aq)[CoCl]^2+(aq)+6H2O(0)pink colourless blueAt room temperature, the equilibrium mixture is blue due to [CoCl]^2-. When cooled in a freezing mixture, the colour of the mixture turns pink due to [Co(H2O)]^2+.

#### 7.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst

A catalyst increases the rate of the chemical reaction by making available a new low energy pathway for the conversion of reactants to products. It increases the rate of forward and reverse reactions that pass through the same transition state and doesn not affect equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation energy for the forward and reverse reactions by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not affect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture. It does not appear in the balanced chemical equation or in the equilibrium constant expression.

Let us consider the formation of NH2 from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly exothermic reaction and proceeds with decrease in total number of moles formed as compared to the reactants. Equilibrium constant decreases with increase in temperature. At low temperature rate decreases and it takes long time to reach at equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give satisfactory rates but poor yields.

German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at temperatures, where the equilibrium concentration of NH3 is reasonably favourable. Since the number of moles formed in the reaction is less than those of reactants, the yield of NH3 can be improved by increasing the pressure.

Optimum conditions of temperature and pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using catalyst are around 500 C and 200 atm.

Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric acid by _contact process_,

[2SO2(g)]+O2[g]^2SO2(g); \(K_{c}\)= 1.710^26

though the value of \(K\) is suggestive of reaction going to completion, but practically the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2Og) is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.

**Note:** If a reaction has an exceedingly small \(K\), a catalyst would be of little help.

#### 7.9 Ionic Equilibrium in Solution

Under the effect of change of concentration on the direction of equilibrium, you have incidently come across with the following equilibrium which involves ions:

[Fe^3(aq)]+SCN^(aq)[Fe(SCN)]^2+(aq)

There are numerous equilibria that involve ions only. In the following sections we will study the equilibria involving ions. It is well known that the aqueous solution of sugar does not conduct electricity. However, when common salt (sodium chloride) is added to water it conducts electricity. Also, the conductance of electricity increases with an increase in concentration of common salt. Michael Faraday classified the substances into two categories based on their ability to conduct electricity. One category of substances conduct electricity in their aqueous solutions and are called _electrolytes_ while the other do not and are thus, referred to as _non electrolytes_. Faraday further classified electrolytes into _strong_ and _weak_ electrolytes. Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water are ionized almost completely, while the weak electrolytes are only partially dissociated. For example, an aqueous solution of sodium chloride is comprised entirely of sodium ions and chloride ions, while that of acetic acid mainly contains unionized acetic acid molecules and only some acetate ions and protons. This is because there is almost 100% ionization in case of sodium chloride as compared to less than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is a weak electrolyte. It should be noted that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is established between ions and the unionized molecules. This type of equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solution is called **ionic equilibrium**. Acids, bases and salts come under the category of electrolytes and may act as either strong or weak electrolytes.

7.10 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS

Acids, bases and salts find widespread occurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice is secreted by the lining of our stomach in a significant amount of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As most of the acids taste sour, the word "acid" has been derived from a latin word "_acidus_" meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue litmus paper in to red and liberate dihydrogen on reacting with metals. Similarly, bases are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste bitter and feel soapy. A common example of a base is washing soda used for washing purposes. When acids and bases are mixed in the right proportion they react with each other to give _salts_. Some commonly known examples of salts are sodium chloride, barium sulphate, sodium nitrate. Sodium chloride (common salt) is an important component of our diet and is formed by reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions which are held together due to electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged species (Fig.7.10). The electrostatic forces between two charges are inversely proportional to dielectric constant of the medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the electrostatic interactions are reduced by a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move freely in the solution. Also, they are well-separated due to hydration with water molecules.

Comparing, the ionization of hydrochloric acid with that of acetic acid in water we find that though both of them are polar covalent

Figure 7.10: Dissolution of sodium chloride in water. Na\({}^{*}\) and Cl ions are stabilised by their hydration with polar water molecules.

molecules, former is completely ionized into its constituent ions, while the latter is only partially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which ionization occurs depends upon the strength of the bond and the extent of solvation of ions produced. The terms dissociation and ionization have earlier been used with different meaning. Dissociation refers to the process of separation of ions in water already existing as such in the solid state of the solute, as in sodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization corresponds to a process in which a neutral molecule splits into charged ions in the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish between the two and use the two terms interchangeably.

7.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and Bases According to Arrhenius theory, _acids are substances that dissociates in water to give hydrogen ions H\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) and bases are substances that produce hydroxyl ions_ OH (aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can be represented by the following equations:

HX (aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) + X\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) or HX(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) + X\({}^{\ast}\)(aq)

A bare proton, H\({}^{\ast}\) is very reactive and cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water molecule to give _trigonal pyramidal hydronium_. H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\) [[H (H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{\ast}\)] (see box). In this chapter we shall use H\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a hydrated proton.

Similarly, a base molecule like MOH ionizes in aqueous solution according to the equation:

MOH(aq) \(\rightarrow\) M\({}^{\ast}\)(aq) + OH (aq)

The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius concept of acid and base, however, suffers from the limitation of being applicable only to aqueous solutions and also, does not account for the basicity of substances like, ammonia which do not possess a hydroxyl group.

**Hydronium and Hydroxyl Ions**

Hydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very small size (~10-15 m radius) and intense electric field, binds itself with the water molecule at one of the two available lone pairs on it giving H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\). This species has been detected in many compounds [e.g., H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\)C\({}^{\ast}\)] in the solid state. In aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further hydrated to give species like H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{2}^{\ast}\), H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{3}^{\ast}\) and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}^{\ast}\). Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated to give several ionic species like H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{2}^{\ast}\), H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{3}^{\ast}\) and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}^{\ast}\) etc.

7.10.2 The Br\(\ddot{\text{o}}\)nsted-Lowry Acids and Bases The Danish chemist, Johannes Bronsted and the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a more general definition of acids and bases. According to Bronsted-Lowry theory, _acid is a substance that is capable of donating a hydrogen ion H\({}^{\ast}\) and bases are substances capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H\({}^{\ast}\)_. In short, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors.

Consider the example of dissolution of NH\({}_{3}\) in H\({}_{2}\)O represented by the following equation:

The basic solution is formed due to the presence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, water molecule acts as proton donor and ammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor and are thus, called Lowry-Br\(\ddot{\text{o}}\)nsted acid and base, respectively. In the reverse reaction, H\({}^{+}\) is transferred from NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) to OH. In this case, NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) acts as a Bronsted acid while OH  acted as a Bronsted base. The acid-base pair that differs only by one proton is called a **cojugate acid-base pair**. Therefore, OH  is called the conjugate base of an acid H\({}_{2}\)O and NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) is called conjugate acid of the base NH\({}_{3}^{+}\). If Bronsted acid is a strong acid then **its conjugate base is a weak base and _vice-versa_**. It may be noted that conjugate acid has one extra proton and each conjugate base has one less proton.

Consider the example of ionization of hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as an acid by donating a proton to H\({}_{2}\)O molecule which acts as a base.

It can be seen in the above equation, that water acts as a base because it accepts the proton. The species H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{+}\) is produced when water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore, Cl is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the conjugate acid of base Cl. Similarly, H\({}_{2}\)O is a conjugate base of an acid H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{+}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{+}\) is a conjugate acid of base H\({}_{2}\)O.

It is interesting to observe the dual role of water as an acid and a base. In case of reaction with HCl water acts as a base while in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by donating a proton.

**Problem 7.12**

What will be the conjugate bases for the following Bronsted acids: HF, H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) and HCO\({}_{3}\)?

**So hitio n**

The conjugate bases should have one proton less in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate bases are: F, HSO\({}_{4}\) and CO\({}_{3}^{2}\)- respectively.

**Problem 7.13**

Write the conjugate acids for the following Bronsted bases: NH\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{3}\) and HCO\({}^{0}\).

**So hitio n**

The conjugate acid should have one extra proton in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate acids are: NH\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) and HCOOH respectively.

**Problem 7.14**

The species: H\({}_{2}\)O, HCO\({}_{3}\), HCO\({}_{4}\) and NH\({}_{3}\) can act both as Bronsted acids and bases. For each case give the corresponding conjugate acid and conjugate base.

**So hitio n**

The answer is given in the following Table:

**Species** **Conjugate acid** **Conjugate base** **H\({}_{2}\)O** **H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{+}\)** **OH** **HO\({}_{3}\)** **HO\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}^{2}\)-** **HSO\({}_{4}^{+}\)** **H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}^{2}\)-** **NH\({}_{3}^{+}\)** **NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)** **NH\({}_{2}\)**

#### 7.10.3 Lewis Acids and Bases

G.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an _acid as a species which accepts electron pair and base which donates an electron pair_. As far as bases are concerned, there is not much difference between Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, as the base provides a lone pair in both the cases. However, in Lewis concept many acids do not have proton. A typical example is reaction of electron deficient species \(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) with \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\).

\(\mathrm{BF}_{3}\) does not have a proton but still acts as an acid and reacts with \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\) by accepting its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be represented by,

\[\mathrm{BF}_{3}+:\mathrm{NH}_{3}\rightarrow\mathrm{BF}_{3}\mathrm{NH}_{3}\]

Electron deficient species like \(\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}\), \(\mathrm{Co}^{3+}\), \(\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\), etc. can act as Lewis acids while species like \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\), \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\), OH etc. which can donate a pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.

**Problem 7.15**:

Classify the following species into Lewis acids and Lewis bases and show how these act as such:

(a) HO (b)F (c) H* (d) \(\mathrm{BC}1_{3}\) Solution

(a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can don at e an electron lone pair (:OH*).

(b) Fluoride ion acts as a Lewis base as it can donate any one of its four electron lone pairs.

(c) A proton is a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride ion.

(d) \(\mathrm{BC}1_{3}\) acts as a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from species like ammonia or amine molecules.

#### 7.11 IONIZATION of ACIDS AND BASES

Arrhenius concept of acids and bases becomes useful in case of ionization of acids and bases as mostly ionizations in chemical and biological systems occur in aqueous medium. Strong acids like perchloric acid (\(\mathrm{HCl}0_{4}\)), hydrochloric acid (\(\mathrm{HBr}\)), hydroxide acid (\(\mathrm{HI}\)), nitric acid (\(\mathrm{H}\mathrm{NO}_{3}\)) and sulphuric acid (\(\mathrm{H}\mathrm{NO}_{4}\)) are termed _strong_ because they are almost completely dissociated into their constituents in an aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton (H') donors. Similarly, strong bases like lithium hydroxide (\(\mathrm{LiOH}\)), sodium hydroxide (\(\mathrm{NaOH}\)), potassium hydroxide(\(\mathrm{KOH}\)), caesium hydroxide (\(\mathrm{CsOH}\)) and barium hydroxide Ba(\(\mathrm{OH}\))\({}_{2}\) are almost completely dissociated into ions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl ions, OH. According to Arrhenius concept they are strong acids and bases as they are able to completely dissociate and produce \(\mathrm{H}_{3}\mathrm{O}^{*}\) and \(\mathrm{OH}\) ions respectively in the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an acid or base may also be gauged in terms of Bronsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a strong acid means a good proton donor and a strong base implies a good proton acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation equilibrium of a weak acid \(\mathrm{HA}\),

\[\mathrm{HA}\mathrm{(aq)}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{(l)}+\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{*}\mathrm{(aq)}+\mathrm{A}\mathrm{(aq)}\]

acid base acid base

In section 7.10.2 we saw that acid (or base) dissociation equilibrium is dynamic involving a transfer of proton in forward and reverse directions. Now, the question arises that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with passage of time which direction is favoured? What is the driving force behind it? In order to answer these questions we shall deal in to the issue of comparing the strengths of the two acids (or bases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two acids \(\mathrm{HA}\) and \(\mathrm{H}_{3}\mathrm{O}^{*}\) present in the above mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. We have to see which amongst them is a stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds in its tendency of donating a proton over the other shall be termed as the stronger acid and the equilibrium will shift in the direction of weaker acid. Say, if \(\mathrm{HA}\) is a stronger acid than \(\mathrm{H}_{3}\mathrm{O}^{*}\), then \(\mathrm{HA}\) will donate protons and not \(\mathrm{H}_{3}\mathrm{O}^{*}\), and the solution will mainly contain \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{H}_{3}\mathrm{O}^{*}\) ions. The equilibrium moves in the direction of formation of weaker acid and weaker base

A and HA at equilibrium. Also, determine the value of \(K_{a}\)and p\(K_{a}\) of the monobasic acid.

**So hution**

pH = - log [H\({}^{*}\)]

Therefore, [H\({}^{*}\)] = 10 - 91 = 10\({}^{-4.50}\)

= 3.16 10\({}^{-5}\)

[H\({}^{*}\)] = [A ] = 3.16 10\({}^{-5}\)

Thus, \(K_{a}\) = [H\({}^{*}\)][A] / [HA]

[HA]\({}_{eq,bm}\) = 0.1 - \(\{3.16 10\({}^{-5}\)}\) 0.1

\(K_{a}\) = (3.16 10\({}^{-5}\))\({}^{2}\) / 0.1 = 1.0 10\({}^{-5}\)

p\(K_{a}\) = - log(10\({}^{-5}\)) = 8

Alternatively, "Percent dissociation" is another useful method for measure of strength of a weak acid and is given as:

Percent dissociation

= [HA]\({}_{\text{dissociated}}\)/[HA]\({}_{\text{small}}\) 100%

\(K_{a}\) = [H\({}_{2}\)O'[ClO] / [HOCl]]

As x << 0.08, therefore 0.08 - x

x\({}^{2}\) / 0.08 = 2.5 10\({}^{-5}\)

x\({}^{2}\) = 2.0 10\({}^{-6}\), thus, x = 1.41 10\({}^{-5}\)

[H\({}^{*}\)] = 1.41 10\({}^{-5}\) M.

Therefore,

Percent dissociation

= [H\({}^{*}\)OCl]\({}_{\text{dissociated}}\) / [H\({}^{*}\)OCl]\({}_{\text{undissociated}}\) ] 100 = 1.41 10\({}^{-5}\) / 0.08 = 1.76 %.

pH = - log(1.41 10\({}^{-5}\)) = 2.85.

#### 7.11.4 Ionization of Weak Bases

The ionization of base MOH can be represented by equation:

MOH(aq) : M'(aq) + OH (aq)

In a weak base there is partial ionization of MOH into M' and OH, the case is similar to that of acid-dissociation equilibrium. The equilibrium constant for base ionization is called **base ionization constant** and is represented by \(K_{b}\). It can be expressed in terms of concentration in molarity of various species in equilibrium by the following equation:

\(K_{b}\) = [M'][OH] / [MOH] (7.33)

Alternatively, if c = initial concentration of base and \(\alpha\) = degree of ionization of base i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium constant can be written as:

\(K_{b}\) = [ca]\({}^{2}\) / c (1-\(\alpha\)) = ca\({}^{2}\) / (1-\(\alpha\))

The values of the ionization constants of some selected weak bases, \(K_{b}\) are given in Table 7.7.

Table 7.7 The Values of the Ionization Constant of Some Weak Bases at 298 K

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Base** & \(K_{b}\) \\ \hline Dimethylamine, (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)NH & 5.4 10\({}^{-4}\) \\ Triethylamine, (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\))\({}_{3}\)N & 6.45 10\({}^{-5}\) \\ Ammonia, NH\({}_{a}\) or NH\({}_{4}\)OH & 1.77 10\({}^{-5}\) \\ Quinine, (A plant product) & 1.10 10\({}^{-6}\) \\ Pyridine, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)N & 1.77 10\({}^{-9}\) \\ Aniline, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 4.27 10\({}^{-10}\) \\ Urea, CO (NH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{2}\) & 1.3 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Many organic compounds like _amines_ are weak bases. Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by another group. For example, methylamine, codeine, quinine and 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:215]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:216]

\(K_{n_{3}}=\{[\text{H}^{\ast}][\text{X}^{2}]\}/\text{[HX]}\)

Here, \(K_{n_{3}}\) and \(K_{n_{2}}\) are called the first and second ionization constants respectively of the acid H\({}_{2}\) X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) we have threeionization constants. The values of the ionization constants for some common polyprotic acids are given in Table 7.8.

It can be seen that higher order ionization constants \(\left(K_{n_{3}},K_{n_{3}}\right)\) are smaller than the lower order ionization constant \(\left(K_{n_{3}}\right)\) of a polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that it is more difficult to remove a positively charged proton from a negative ion due to electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the case of removing a proton from the uncharged H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) as compared from a negatively charged HCO\({}_{3}\). Similarly, it is more difficult to remove a proton from a doubly charged HPO\({}_{4}^{2}\) anion as compared to H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\).

Polyprotic acid solutions contain a mixture of acids like H\({}_{2}\)A. HA and A\({}^{2^{\ast}}\) in case of a diprotic acid. H\({}_{2}\)A being a strong acid, the primary reaction involves the dissociation of H\({}_{2}\)A, and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\) in the solution comes mainly from the first dissociation step.

#### 7.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid Strength

Having discussed quantitatively the strengths of acids and bases, we come to a stage where we can calculate the pH of a given acid solution. But, the curiosity rises about why should some acids be stronger than others? What factors are responsible for making them stronger? The answer lies in its being a complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking we can say that the extent of dissociation of an acid depends on the strength and polarity of the H-A bond.

In general, when strength of H-A bond decreases, that is, the energy required to break the bond decreases. HA becomes a stronger acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more polar i.e., the electronegativity difference between the atoms H and A increases and there is marked charge separation, cleavage of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing the acidity.

But it should be noted that while comparing elements in the same group of the periodic table, H-A bond strength is a more important factor in determining acidity than its polar nature. As the size of A increases down the group, H-A bond strength decreases and so the acid strength increases. For example,

Size increases

\(\begin{array}{c}\hline\hline\text{HF <<HCl <<HBr <<HI}\\ \hline\text{Acid strength increases}\\ \text{Similarly, H}_{2}\text{S is stronger acid than H}_{2}\text{O}.\end{array}\)

But, when we discuss elements in the same row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity becomes the deciding factor for determining the acid strength. As the electron egativity of A increases, the strength of the acid also increases. For example,

Electron negativity of A increases

\(\begin{array}{c}\hline\hline\text{CH}_{4}<\text{NH}_{3}<\text{H}_{2}\text{O <HF}\\ \hline\text{Acid strength increases}\\ \text{7.11.8 Common Ion Effectinthe}\\ \text{Ionization of Acids and Bases}\end{array}\)

Consider an example of acetic acid dissociation equilibrium represented as:

\(\begin{array}{c}\text{CH}_{3}\text{COOH(aq)}\cdot\text{H}^{\ast}\text{(aq) + CH}_{3}\text{COO (aq)}\\ \text{or HAc(aq)}\cdot\text{H}^{\ast}\text{(aq) + Ac (aq)}\\ \text{$K_{\text{a}}=[\text{H}^{\ast}][\text{Ac }]/[\text{HAc}]$}\\ \end{array}\)

Addition of acetate ions to an acetic acid solution results in decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\({}^{\ast}\)]. Also, if H- ions are added from an external source then the equilibrium moves in the direction of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction of reducing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\({}^{\ast}\)]. This phenomenon is an example of 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:218]

on ionization of salts either exist as hydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact with water to reform corresponding acids/bases depending upon the nature of salts. The later process of interaction between water and cations/anions or both of salts is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected by this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na\({}^{*}\), K\({}^{*}\), Ca\({}^{2^{*}}\), Ba\({}^{2^{*}}\), etc.) of strong bases and anions (e.g., Cl, Br, NO\({}_{3}\), ClO\({}_{4}\) etc.) of strong acids simply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of salts formed from strong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.

We now consider the hydrolysis of the salts of the following \(g\) types :

1. salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., CH\({}_{3}\)COONa.
2. salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., NH\({}_{4}\)Cl, and
3. salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., CH\({}_{3}\)COONH\({}_{4}\).

In the first case, CH\({}_{3}\)COONa being a salt of weak acid, CH\({}_{3}\)COOH and strong base, NaOH gets completely ionised in aqueous solution. CH\({}_{3}\)COONa(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{*}\)(aq)+ Na\({}^{*}\)(aq) Acetate ion thus formed undergoes hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and OH\({}^{*}\) ions CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{*}\)(aq)+H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{*}\)(q)+OH\({}^{*}\)(aq) Acetic acid being a weak acid (\(K_{\rm a}=1.8\)\(10^{-9}\)) remains mainly unionised in solution. This results in increase of OH\({}^{*}\) ion concentration in solution making it alkaline. The pH of such a solution is more than 7.

Similarly, NH\({}_{4}\)Cl formed from weak base, NH\({}_{4}\)OH and strong acid, HCl, in water dissociates completely.

NH\({}_{4}\)Cl(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}^{*}\)(aq) +Cl (aq) Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with water to form NH\({}_{4}\)OH and H\({}^{*}\) ions NH\({}_{4}^{*}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base (\(K_{\rm b}=1.77\)\(10^{-5}\)) and therefore remains almost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H\({}^{*}\) ion concentration in solution making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of NH\({}_{4}\)Cl solution in water is less than 7.

Consider the hydrolysis of CH\({}_{3}\)COONH\({}_{4}\) salt formed from weak acid and weak base. The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow: CH\({}_{3}\)COO + NH\({}_{4}^{*}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\leftrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH + NH\({}_{4}\)OH CH\({}_{3}\)COOH and NH\({}_{4}\)OH, also remain into partially dissociated form: CH\({}_{3}\)COOH \(\leftrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{*}\) + H\({}^{*}\) NH\({}_{4}\)OH + OH H\({}_{2}\)O \(\leftrightarrow\) H\({}^{*}\) + OH Without going into detailed calculation, it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is independent of concentration of solution, and pH of such solutions is determined by their pK values:

\[\text{pH}=7+\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$}}${$\text{$\text{$}}{${$ $}{$}{${}${${}${${}${${}${${}${${}${${}${$${}${$$$$$$$$$${$$$$$$$$}$}{{$$$$$$$$ $}{${$$$$${$$$$$$${$$$$$$${$$$$$$$$$$$$}{$$$$$${$$$$$$$$$$${$$$$$$$$$$$$$${$$$$$$$$$$$$$$${{$$$$$$$$$$$$}{$$$$${{$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$}{{{$

\(7.13.2\)Common Ion Effect on Solubility of Ionic Salts

It is expected from Le Chatelier's principle that if we increase the concentration of any one of the ions, it should combine with the ion of its opposite charge and some of the salt will be precipitated till once again \(K_{\rm sp}=G_{\rm sp}\). Similarly, if the concentration of one of the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve to increase the concentration of both the ions till once again \(K_{\rm sp}=G_{\rm sp}\). This is applicable even to soluble salts like sodium chloride except that due to higher concentrations of the ions, we use their activities instead of their molarities in the expression for \(G_{\rm sp}\). Thus if we take a saturated solution of sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride is precipitated due to increased concentration (activity) of chloride ion available from the dissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very high purity and we can get rid of impurities like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The common ion effect is also used for almost complete precipitation of a particular ion as its sparing soluble salt, with very low value of solubility product for gravimetric estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide (or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as its sulphate for quantitative estimations.

## Summary

When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant. \(K_{c}\) is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the stoichiometric coefficient.

For reaction, a A + b B. c C + d D

\(K_{c}=[C]^{c}[D]^{d}/[A]^{a}[B]^{b}\)

Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as \(K_{p}\) and is written by replacing concentration terms by partial pressures in \(K_{c}\) expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by reaction quotient \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) which is equal to \(K_{c}\) at equilibrium. **Le Chatelier's principle** states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors. **Catalyst** does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.

All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called **electrolytes**. Acids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions is due to anions and cations produced by the **dissociation or ionization of electrolytes** in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules, According to **Arrhenius**, **acids** give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. **Bronsted-Lowry** on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Bronsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a **conjugate pair of acid-base** differs only by one proton. **Lewis** further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (\(K_{c}\)) and weak bases (\(K_{c}\)) are developed using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are discussed. The **pH scale** (pH = -log[H^]) for the hydrogen ion concentration (activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = - log[OH] : \(pK_{a}=-log[K_{c}]\) : \(pK_{b}=-log[K_{c}]\); and \(pK_{w}=-log[K_{c}]\) etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we note that the equation: pH + pOH = \(pK_{b}\) is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution.The definition of **buffer solutions**. and their importance are discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium constant is introduced as **solubility product constant** (\(K_{p}\)). Its relationship with solubility of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.

## Chapter 8 Redox Reactions

### 8.1 Chemical Idea of Redox Reactions - Oxidation and Reduction Reactions

Originally, the term **oxidation** was used to describe the addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%), many elements combine with it and this is the principal reason why they commonly occur on the earth in the form of their oxides. The following reactions represent oxidation processes according to the limited definition of oxidation:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{2 Mg (s) + O}_{2}\mbox{ (g) }\rightarrow\mbox{2 MgO (s)}\\ \mbox{S (s) + O}_{2}\mbox{ (g) }\rightarrow\mbox{SO}_{2}\mbox{ (g)}\end{array} \tag{8.1}\]In reactions (8.1) and (8.2), the elements magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on account of addition of oxygen to them. Similarly, methane is oxidised owing to the addition of oxygen to it.

\[\mathrm{CH_{4}\left(g\right)+2O_{2}\left(g\right)\to CO_{2}\left(g\right)+2H_{2}O \left(l\right)} \tag{8.3}\]

A careful examination of reaction (8.3) in which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, therefore, the scope of term oxidation was broadened to include the removal of hydrogen from a substance. The following illustration is another reaction where removal of hydrogen can also be cited as an oxidation reaction.

\[\mathrm{2\,H_{2}S(g)+O_{2}\left(g\right)\to 2\ S\left(s\right)+2H_{2}O\left(l\right)} \tag{8.4}\]

As knowledge of chemists grew, it was natural to extend the term oxidation for reactions similar to (8.1 to 8.4), which do not involve oxygen but other electronegative elements. The oxidation of magnesium with fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs according to the following reactions :

\[\mathrm{Mg\left(s\right)+F_{2}\left(g\right)\to MgF_{2}\left(s\right)} \tag{8.5}\]

\[\mathrm{Mg\left(s\right)+Cl_{2}\left(g\right)\to MgCl_{2}\left(s\right)} \tag{8.6}\]

\[\mathrm{Mg\left(s\right)+S\left(s\right)\to MgS\left(s\right)} \tag{8.7}\]

Incorporating the reactions (8.5 to 8.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions encouraged chemists to consider not only the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but also the removal of electropositive elements as oxidation. Thus the reaction :

\[\mathrm{2K_{4}\left[Fe(CN)_{6}\left(aq\right)+H_{2}O_{2}\left(aq\right)\to 2K_{3} \left[Fe(CN)_{6}\left(aq\right)+2KOH\left(aq\right)\right]} \tag{8.3}\]

is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal of electropositive element potassium from potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the term "oxidation" is defined as the **addition of oxygen/electronegative element to a substance or removal of hydrogen/electropositive element from a substance.**

In the beginning, reduction was considered as removal of oxygen from a compound. However, the term **reduction** has been broadened these days to include **removal of oxygen/electronegative element from a substance or addition of hydrogen/electropositive element to a substance.**

According to the definition given above, the following are the examples of reduction processes:

\[\mathrm{2\,HgO\left(s\right)\xrightarrow{A}2\,Hg\left(l\right)+O_{2}\left(g \right)} \tag{8.8}\]

(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )

\[\mathrm{2\,FeCl_{3}\left(aq\right)+H_{2}\left(g\right)\to 2\,FeCl_{2}\left(aq \right)+2HCl_{2}\left(aq\right)} \tag{8.9}\]

(removal of electronegative element, chlorine from ferric chloride)

\[\mathrm{CH_{2}=CH_{2}\left(g\right)+H_{2}\left(g\right)\to H_{3}C-CH_{3}\left(g \right)} \tag{8.10}\]

(addition of hydrogen)

\[\mathrm{2HgCl_{2}\left(aq\right)+SnCl_{2}\left(aq\right)\to Hg_{2}Cl_{2} \left(s\right)+SnCl_{4}\left(aq\right)} \tag{8.11}\]

(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride)

In reaction (8.11) simultaneous oxidation of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is also occurring because of the addition of electronegative element chlorine to it. It was soon realised that oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously (as will be apparent by re-examining all the equations given above), hence, the word "redox" was coined for this class of chemical reactions.

**Problem 8.1**

In the reactions given below, identify the species undergoing oxidation and reduction:

**(i)**\(H_{2}S\left(g\right)+Cl_{2}\left(g\right)\to 2\,HCl\left(g\right)+S\left(s\right)\)
**(ii)**\(3Fe_{3}O_{4}\left(s\right)+8Al\left(s\right)\to 9\,Fe\left(s\right)\)

\[\mathrm{+4Al_{2}O_{3}\left(s\right)}\] (iii)**\(2\,Na\left(s\right)+H_{2}\left(g\right)\to 2\,NaH\left(s\right)\)

**Solution**

(i) \(H_{2}S\) is oxidised because a more electronegative element, chlorine is added to hydrogen (or a more electropositive element, hydrogen has been removed from S). Chlorine is reduced due to addition of hydrogen to it.

**(ii)**\(Alumin

**(Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\)) is reduced because oxygen has been removed from it.**

**(iii) With the careful application of the concept of electronegativity only we may infer that sodium is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced.**

**Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to think in terms of another way to define redox reactions.**

### Redox reactions in terms of electron TRANSFER reactions

**We have already learnt that the reactions**

\[2\text{Na(s)}+\text{C}_{\text{L}}(\text{g})\ \rightarrow\ 2\text{NaC1 (s)}\] (8.12) \[2\text{Na(s)}+\text{O}_{\text{2}}(\text{g})\ \rightarrow\ \text{Na}_{2}\text{O(s)}\] (8.13) \[2\text{Na(s)}+\text{S(s)}\ \rightarrow\ \text{Na}_{2}\text{S(s)}\] (8.14) **are redox reactions because in each of these reactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition of either oxygen or more electronegative element to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to each of these, the electropositive elements sodium has been added. From our knowledge of chemical bonding we also know that sodium chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide are ionic compounds and perhaps better written as Na^C1^(s), (Na^)2^2-(s), and (Na^)2 S^2-(s). Development of charges on the species produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions (8.12 to 8.14) in the following manner :**

**for convenience, each of the above processes can be considered as two separate steps, one involving the loss of electrons and the other the gain of electrons. As an illustration, we may further elaborate one of these, say, the formation of sodium chloride, 2 Na(s) \(\rightarrow\) 2 Na^(s) + 2 e^-

\[\text{C}_{\text{L}}(\text{g})+2\text{e}^{-}\to 2\text{ Cl}^{\prime}(\text{g})\]

Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives the overall reaction :

\[2\text{ Na(s)}+\text{C}_{\text{L}}(\text{g})\ \rightarrow\text{2 Na^{*}Cl^{\prime}(s) or 2 NaCl(s)}\]

Reactions 8.12 to 8.14 suggest that half reactions that involve loss of electrons are called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the half reactions that involve gain of electrons are called reduction reactions. It may not be out of context to mention here that the new way of defining oxidation and reduction has been achieved only by establishing a correlation between the behaviour of species as per the classical idea and their interplay in electron-transfer change. In reactions (8.12 to 8.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as a reducing agent because it donates electron to each of the elements interacting with it and thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising agents because these accept electrons from sodium. To summarise, we may mention that _Oxidation :_ Loss of electron(s) by any species. _Reduction:_ Gain of electron(s) by any species. _Oxidising agent :_ Acceptor of electron(s). _Reducing agent :_ Donor of electron(s).

**Problem 8.2**: Justify that the reaction :

2 Na(s) + H2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2 NaH (s) is a redox change.

**Solution**

Since in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may also be represented as Na^H^(s), this suggests that one half reaction in this process is :

\[2\text{ Na(s)}\ \rightarrow\text{2 Na^{*}(g)}\ +\ 2\text{e}^{-}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:239]

At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni\({}^{2+}\)(aq) and Co\({}^{2+}\)(aq) are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the reactants [Co(s) and Ni\({}^{2+}\)(aq)] nor the products [Co\({}^{2+}\)(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured.

This competition for release of electrons incidently reminds us of the competition for release of protons among acids. The similarity suggests that we might develop a table in which metals and their ions are listed on the basis of their tendency to release electrons just as we do in the case of acids to indicate the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact we have already made certain comparisons. By comparison we have come to know that zinc releases electrons to copper and copper releases electrons to silver and, therefore, the electron releasing tendency of the metals is in the order: Zn\(>\)Cu\(>\)Ag. We would love to make our list more vast and design a metal activity series or electrochemical series. The competition for electrons between various metals helps us to design a class of cells, named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical reactions become the source of electrical energy. We would study more about these cells in Class XII.

### Oxidation Number

A less obvious example of electron transfer is realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water by the reaction:

\[2H_{2}(g)+O_{2}(g)\to 2H_{2}O(l) \tag{8.18}\]

Though not simple in its approach, yet we can visualise the H atom as going from a neutral (zero) state in H\({}_{2}\) to a positive state in H\({}_{2}\)O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O\({}_{2}\) to a dinegative state in H\({}_{2}\)O. It is assumed that there is an electron transfer from H to O and consequently H\({}_{2}\) is oxidised and O\({}_{2}\) is reduced. However, as we shall see later, the charge transfer is only partial and is perhaps better described as an electron shift rather than a complete loss of electron by H and gain by O. What has been said here with respect to equation (8.18) may be true for a good number of other reactions involving covalent compounds. Two such examples of this class of the reactions are:

\[H_{2}(s)+Cl_{2}(g)\to 2HCl(g) \tag{8.19}\]

and,

\[CH_{4}(g)+4Cl_{2}(g)\to CCl_{4}(l)+4HCl(g) \tag{8.20}\]

In order to keep track of electron shifts in chemical reactions involving formation of covalent compounds, a more practical method of using oxidation number has been developed. In this method, it is always assumed that there is a complete transfer of electron from a less electronegative atom to a more electronegative atom. For example, we rewrite equations (8.18 to 8.20) to show charge on each of the atoms forming part of the reaction :

\[0\] +1 -2

\[2H_{2}(g)+O_{2}(g)\to 2H_{2}O(l) \tag{8.21}\]

\[0\] +1 -1

\[H_{2}(s)+Cl_{2}(g)\to 2HCl(g) \tag{8.22}\]

\[-4+1\] 0 +4 -1 +1 -1

\[CH_{4}(g)+4Cl_{2}(g)\to 4CC_{4}(l)+4HCl(g) \tag{8.23}\]

It may be emphasised that the assumption of electron transfer is made for book-keeping purpose only and it will become obvious at a later stage in this unit that it leads to the simple description of redox reactions.

Oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in compound ascertained according to a set of rules formulated on the basis that

Figure 8.2: Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker.

electron in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more electronegative element.

It is not always possible to remember or make out easily in a compound/ion, which element is more electronegative than the other. Therefore, a set of rules has been formulated to determine the oxidation number of an element in a compound/ion. If two or more than two atoms of an element are present in the molecule/ion such as Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)/Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}^{2}\), the oxidation number of the atom of that element will then be the average of the oxidation number of all the atoms of that element. We may at this stage, state the rules for the calculation of oxidation number. These rules are:

1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined state, each atom bears an oxidation number of zero. Evidently each atom in H\({}_{2}\), O\({}_{2}\), Cl\({}_{2}\), O\({}_{3}\), P\({}_{4}\), S\({}_{8}\), Na, Mg, Al has the oxidation number zero.
2. For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion. Thus Na\({}^{+}\) ion has an oxidation number of +1, Mg\({}^{2+}\) ion, +2, Fe\({}^{3+}\)ion, +3, Cl ion, -1, O\({}^{2-}\) ion, -2; and so on. In their compounds all alkali metals have oxidation number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium is regarded to have an oxidation number of +3 in all its compounds.
3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is -2. However, we come across two kinds of exceptions here. One arises in the case of peroxides and superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in which oxygen atoms are directly linked to each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of -1, in superoxides (e.g., KO\({}_{2}\), RbO\({}_{2}\)) each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of -(1%). The second exception appears rarely, i.e. when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In such compounds e.g., oxygen diffluoride (OF\({}_{2}\)) and dioxygen diffluoride (O\({}_{2}\)F\({}_{2}\)), the oxygen is assigned an oxidation number of +2 and +1, respectively. The number assigned to oxygen will depend upon the bonding state of oxygen but this number would now be a positive figure only.
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when it is bonded to metals in binary compounds (that is compounds containing two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, and CaH\({}_{2}\), its oxidation number is -1.
5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an oxidation number of -1. Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) also have an oxidation number of -1, when they occur as halide ions in their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and iodine when combined with oxygen, for example in oxocatids and oxoanions, have positive oxidation numbers.
6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a compound must be zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of the ion must equal the charge on the ion. Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the carbonate ion, (CO\({}_{3}\))\({}^{2-}\) must equal -2.

By the application of above rules, we can find out the oxidation number of the desired element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear that the metallic elements have positive oxidation number and nonmetallic elements have positive or negative oxidation number. The atoms of transition elements usually display several positive oxidation states. The highest oxidation number of a representative element is the group number for the first two groups and the group number minus 10 (following the long form of periodic table) for the other groups. Thus, it implies that the highest value of oxidation number exhibited by an atom of an element generally increases across the period in the periodic table. In the third period, the highest value of oxidation number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated below in the compounds of the elements.

A term that is often used interchangeably with the oxidation number is the **oxidation state**. Thus in CO\({}_{2}\), the oxidation state of carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number and similarly the oxidation state as well as oxidation number of oxygen is -2. This implies that the oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound.

The oxidation number state of a metal in a compound is sometimes presented according to the notation given by German chemist, Alfred Stock. It is popularly known as **Stock notation**. According to this, the oxidation number is expressed by putting a Roman numeral representing the oxidation number in parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in the molecular formula. Thus arous chloride and auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and Au(II)Cl\({}_{3}\). Similarly, stannous chloride and stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl\({}_{2}\) and Sn(IV)Cl\({}_{4}\). This change in oxidation number implies change in oxidation state, which in turn helps to identify whether the species is present in oxidised form or reduced form. Thus, Hg(I)Cl\({}_{2}\) is the reduced form of Hg(II)Cl\({}_{2}\).

```
Problem8.3 Using Stock notation, represent the following compounds :HAuCl\({}_{4}\), Tl\({}_{2}\)O, FeO, Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO\({}_{2}\). Solution By applying various rules of calculating the oxidation number of the desired element in a compound, the oxidation number of each metallic element in its compound is as follows: HAuCl\({}_{4}\)\(\rightarrow\) & Au has 3 Tl\({}_{2}\)O\(\rightarrow\) & Tl has 1 FeO\(\rightarrow\) & Fe has 2 Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) & Fe has 3 CuI\(\rightarrow\) & Cu has 1 CuO\(\rightarrow\) & Cu has 2 MnO\(\rightarrow\) & Mn has 2 MnO\({}_{2}\) & Mn has 4 Therefore, these compounds may be represented as: HAu(II)Cl\({}_{4}\), Tl\({}_{2}\)(I)O, Fe(II)O, Fe\({}_{2}\)(III)O\({}_{3}\), Cu(I)I, Cu(II)O, Mn(II)O, Mn(IV)O\({}_{2}\).
```

The idea of oxidation number has been invariably applied to define oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing agent (reducant) and the redox reaction. To summarise, we may say that:

_Oxidation:_ An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Reduction:_ A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Oxidising agent:_ A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are called as **oxidants** also.

_Reducing agent:_ A reagent which lowers the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are also called as **reducants**.

_Redox reactions:_ Reactions which involve change in oxidation number of the interacting species.

``` Problem8.4 Justify that the reaction:
2Cu\({}_{2}\)O(s) + Cu\({}_{2}\)S(s) \(\rightarrow\) 6Cu(s) + SO\({}_{2}\)(g) is a redox reaction. Identify the species oxidised/reduced, which acts as an oxidant and which acts as a reductant. Solution Let us assign oxidation number to each of the species in the reaction under examination. This results into: +1 -2 +1 -2 0 +4 -2 2Cu\({}_{2}\)O(s) + Cu\({}_{2}\)S(s) \(\rightarrow\) 6Cu(s) + SO\({}_{2}\) We therefore, conclude that in this reaction _copper is reduced_ from +1 state to zero oxidation state and _sulphur_ is _oxidised_ from -2 state to +4 state. The above reaction is thus a _redox reaction_.

Further, Cu\({}_{2}\)O helps sulphur in Cu\({}_{2}\)S to increase its oxidation number, therefore, Cu(I) is an oxidant; and sulphur of Cu\({}_{2}\)S helps copper both in Cu\({}_{2}\)S itself and Cu\({}_{2}\)O to decrease its oxidation number; therefore, sulphur of Cu\({}_{2}\)S is reductant.

#### 8.3.1 Types of Redox Reactions

_1. Combination reactions_

A combination reaction may be denoted in the manner:

\[\mbox{A}+\mbox{B}\ \rightarrow\ \mbox{C}\]

Either A and B or both A and B must be in the elemental form for such a reaction to be a redox reaction. All combustion reactions, which make use of elemental dioxygen, as well as other reactions involving elements other than dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some important examples of this category are:

\[\begin{array}{cccc}0&0&+4-2\\ 0&0&+2-3\\ 3\mbox{Mg(s)}+\mbox{N}_{2}(\mbox{g})&\mathbf{\Delta}&\mbox{Mg}_{3} \mbox{N}_{2}(\mbox{s})\\ -4+1&0&+4-2&+1-2\\ \mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})&\mathbf{\Delta}&\mbox{ CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(\mbox{I})\end{array}\]

_2. Decomposition reactions_

Decomposition reactions are the opposite of combination reactions. Precisely, a decomposition reaction leads to the breakdown of a compound into two or more components at least one of which must be in the elemental state. Examples of this class of reactions are:

\[\begin{array}{cccc}+1&-2&0&0\\ 2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(\mbox{I})&\mathbf{\Delta}&2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{ (g)}+\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\\ +1&-1&0&0\\ 2\mbox{NaH}(\mbox{s})&\mathbf{\Delta}&2\mbox{Na}\mbox{ (s)}+\mbox{H}_{2}(\mbox{g})\\ +1&+5-2&+1-1&0\\ 2\mbox{KCl}_{3}(\mbox{s})&\mathbf{\Delta}&2\mbox{KCl}(\mbox{s})+3 \mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\end{array}\]

It may carefully be noted that there is no change in the oxidation number of hydrogen in methane under combination reactions and that of potassium in potassium chlorate in reaction (8.28). This may also be noted here that all decomposition reactions are not redox reactions. For example, decomposition of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction.

\[\begin{array}{cccc}+2&+4&-2&+2&+4-2\\ \mbox{CaCO}_{3}&\mathbf{\Delta}&\mbox{CaO}(\mbox{s})+\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})\\ \end{array}\]

_3. Displacement reactions_

In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion (or an atom) of another element. It may be denoted as:

\[\mbox{X}+\mbox{YZ}\ \rightarrow\mbox{XZ}+\mbox{Y}\]

Displacement reactions fit into two categories: metal displacement and non-metal displacement.

_(a) Metal displacement:_ A metal in a compound can be displaced by another metal in the uncombined state. We have already discussed about this class of the reactions under section 8.2.1. Metal displacement reactions find many applications in metallurgical processes in which pure metals are obtained from their compounds in ones. A few such examples are:

\[\begin{array}{cccc}+2&+4-2&0&+2+4-2\\ \mbox{CuSO}_{4}(\mbox{aq})+\mbox{Zn}(\mbox{s})\rightarrow\mbox{Cu}(\mbox{s})+ \mbox{ZnSO}_{4}(\mbox{aq})\\ +5&-2&0&0&+2-2\\ \mbox{V}_{2}\mbox{O}_{5}(\mbox{s})+5\mbox{Ca}(\mbox{s})&\mathbf{\Delta}&2 \mbox{V}(\mbox{s})+5\mbox{CaO}(\mbox{s})\\ +4&-1&0&0&+2-1\\ \mbox{TiCl}_{4}(\mbox{I})+2\mbox{Mg}(\mbox{s})&\mathbf{\Delta}&\mbox{ Ti}(\mbox{s})+2\mbox{MgCl}_{2}(\mbox{s})\\ +3&-2&0&+3-2&0\\ \mbox{Cr}_{2}\mbox{O}_{3}(\mbox{s})+2\mbox{Al}(\mbox{s})&\mathbf{\Delta}& \mbox{Al}_{2}\mbox{O}_{3}(\mbox{s})+2\mbox{Cr}(\mbox{s})\\ \end{array}\]

In each case, the reducing metal is a better reducing agent than the one that is being reduced which evidently shows more capability to lose electrons as compared to the one that is reduced.

_(b) Non-metal displacement:_ The non-metal displacement redox reactions include hydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring reaction involving oxygen displacement.

All alkali metals and some alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) which are very good reductants, will displace hydrogen from cold water.

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-2&+1-2+1&0\\ 2\text{Na(s)}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}&\rightarrow&2\text{NaOH(aq)}+\text{H}_{2} \text{(g)}\\ \\ 0&+1-2&+2-2+1&0\\ \text{Ca(s)}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}&\rightarrow&\text{Ca(OH)}_{2}\text{( aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{(g)}\end{array} \tag{8.34}\]

Less active metals such as magnesium and iron react with steam to produce dihydrogen gas:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-2&+2-2+1&0\\ \text{Mg(s)}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}&\xrightarrow{\text{\huge{A}}}\text{Mg(OH)}_{2} \text{(s)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{(g)}\\ \\ 0&+1-2&+3-2&0\\ 2\text{Fe(s)}+3\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}&\xrightarrow{\text{\huge{A}}}\text{Fe }_{2}\text{O}_{3}\text{(s)}+3\text{H}_{2}\text{(g)}\end{array} \tag{8.35}\]

Many metals, including those which do not react with cold water, are capable of displacing hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids may even be produced by such metals which do not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are the examples of such metals. A few examples for the displacement of hydrogen from acids are:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-1&+2-1&0\\ \text{Zn(s)}+2\text{HCl(aq)}&\rightarrow&\text{ZnCl}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{ 2}\text{(g)}\\ \\ 0&+1-1&+2-1&0\\ \text{Mg(s)}+2\text{HCl(aq)}&\rightarrow&\text{MgCl}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{ 2}\text{(g)}\\ \\ 0&+1-1&+2-1&0\\ \text{Fe(s)}+2\text{HCl(aq)}&\rightarrow&\text{FeCl}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{ 2}\text{(g)}\end{array} \tag{8.36}\]

Reactions (8.37 to 8.39) are used to prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory. Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in the rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is the slowest for the least active metal Fe, and the fastest for the most reactive metal. Mg. Very less active metals, which may occur in the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold (Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.

In section (8.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals - zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons show their reducing activity in the order Zn\(>\) Cu\(>\)Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements as oxidising agents decreases as we move down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is so reactive that it attacks water an d displaces the oxygen of water:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}+1-2&0&+1-1&0\\ 2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}+2\text{F}_{2}\text{(g)}&\rightarrow&4\text{HF(aq)}+ \text{O}_{2}\text{(g)}\end{array} \tag{8.37}\]

It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine using fluorine are not generally carried out in aqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine can displace bromide and iodide ions in an aqueous solution as shown below:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-1&+1-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{KBr}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{ KCl}\text{(aq)}+\text{Br}_{2}\text{(l)}\\ \\ 0&+1-1&+1-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{KI}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{ KCl}\text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(s)} \end{array} \tag{8.38}\]

As Br\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\) are coloured and dissolve in CCl\({}_{4}\), can easily be identified from the colour of the solution. The above reactions can be written in ionic form as:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&-1&-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{Br}^{-}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{Cl}^{-} \text{(aq)}+\text{Br}_{2}\text{(l)}\\ 0&-1&-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{I}^{-}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{Cl}^{-} \text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(s)}\end{array} \tag{8.39}\]

Reactions (8.38 to 8.39) are used to prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory. Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in the rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is the slowest for the least active metal Fe, and the fastest for the most reactive metal. Mg. Very less active metals, which may occur in the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold (Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.

In section (8.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals - zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons show their reducing activity in the order Zn\(>\) Cu\(>\)Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements as oxidising agents decreases as we move down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is so reactive that it attacks water an d displaces the oxygen of water:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}+1-2&0&+1-1&0\\ 2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}+2\text{F}_{2}\text{(g)}&\rightarrow&4\text{HF(aq)}+ \text{O}_{2}\text{(g)}\end{array} \tag{8.30}\]

It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine using fluorine are not generally carried out in aqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine can displace bromide and iodide ions in an aqueous solution as shown below:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-1&+1-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{KBr}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{ KCl}\text{(aq)}+\text{Br}_{2}\text{(l)} \end{array} \tag{8.31}\]

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&+1-1&+1-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{KI}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{ KCl}\text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(s)} \end{array} \tag{8.32}\]

As Br\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\) are coloured and dissolve in CCl\({}_{4}\), can easily be identified from the colour of the solution. The above reactions can be written in ionic form as:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&-1&-1&0\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{(g)}+2\text{Br}^{-}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{Cl}^{-} \text{(aq)}+\text{Br}_{2}\text{(l)}\end{array} \tag{8.33}\]

Reactions (8.31) and (8.32) form the basis of identifying Br\({}^{-}\) and I\({}^{-}\) in the laboratory through the test popularly known as 'Layer Test'. It may not be out of place to mention here that bromine likewise can displace iodide ion in solution:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}0&-1&-1&0\\ \text{Br}_{2}\text{(l)}&+2\text{I}^{-}\text{(aq)}&\rightarrow&2\text{Br}^{-} \text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(s)}\end{array} \tag{8.34}\]

The halogen displacement reactions have a direct industrial application. The recovery of halogens from their halides requires an oxidation process, which is represented by:

\[2\text{X}^{-}\rightarrow\text{X}_{2}+2\text{e}^{-} \tag{8.35}\]

here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas chemical means are available to oxidise Cl\({}^{-}\), Br\({}^{-}\)and I\({}^{-}\), as fluorine is the strongest oxidising

**Problem 8.7**:

Why do the following reactions proceed differently?

\(\text{Pb}_{3}\text{O}_{4}+8\text{HC1}\to 3\text{PbCl}_{2}+\text{Cl}_{2}+4\text{H}_{2} \text{O}\)

and

\(\text{Pb}_{3}\text{O}_{4}+4\text{HNO}_{3}\to 2\text{Pb}(\text{NO}_{3})_{2}+\text{Pb} \text{O}_{2}+2\text{H}_{2} \text{O}\)

**Solution**

\(\text{Pb}_{3}\text{O}_{4}\) is actually a stoichiometric mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of PbO\({}_{2}\). In PbO\({}_{2}\), lead is present in +4 oxidation state, whereas the stable oxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO\({}_{2}\) thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising agent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl\({}^{\prime}\) ion of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in mind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore, the reaction

\(\text{Pb}_{3}\text{O}_{4}+8\text{HC1}\to 3\text{PbCl}_{2}+\text{Cl}_{2}+4\text{H}_{2} \text{O}\)

can be splitted into two reactions namely:

\(2\text{PbO}+4\text{HC1}\to 2\text{PbCl}_{2}+2\text{H}_{2} \text{O}\)

(acid-base reaction)

\(+4\)\(-1\)\(+2\)\(0\)\

**Solution**

**Step 1:** The skeletalonic equation is:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{SO}_{3}^{2-} (\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\\ \text{+SO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 2:** Assign oxidation numbers for Cr and S

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{+6}\,\text{-2}\\ \text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{SO}_{3}^{2-}(\text{aq}) \rightarrow\text{Cr}(\text{aq})+\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

This indicates that the dichromatic ion is the oxidant and the sulphite ion is the reductant.

**Step 3:** Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make them equal:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{+6}\,\text{-2}\\ \text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{3SO}_{3}^{2-}(\text{aq}) \rightarrow\text{2Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{3SO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 4:** As the reaction occurs in the acidic medium, and further the ionic charges are not equal on both the sides, add SH\({}^{+}\) on the left to make ionic charges equal

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{3SO}_{3}^ {2-}(\text{aq})+\text{8H}^{+}\to 2\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\\ \text{+3SO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 5:** Finally, count the hydrogen atoms, and add appropriate number of water molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right to achieve balanced redox change,

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{3SO}_{3}^ {2-}(\text{aq})+\text{8H}^{+}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\\ \text{2Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{3SO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})+\text{4H}_{2}\text{O }(\text{I})\end{array}\]

**Problem 8.9**

Permanganate ion reacts with bromide ion in basic medium to give manganese dioxide and bromate ion. Write the balanced ionic equation for the reaction.

**Solution**

**Step 1:** The skeletal ionic equation is:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{MnO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq}) \rightarrow\text{MnO}_{2}(\text{s})+\text{Br}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 2:** Assign oxidation numbers for Mn and Br

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{+7}\,\text{-1}\\ \text{MnO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{MnO}_{2} (\text{s})+\text{Br}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

this indicates that permanganate ion is the reactant.

**Step 3:** Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make the increase equal to the decrease.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{+7}\,\text{-1}\\ \text{2MnO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{2MnO}_{2 }(\text{s})+\text{Br}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 4:** As the reaction occurs in the basic medium, and the ionic charges are not equal on both sides, add 2 OH\({}^{-}\) ions on the right to make ionic charges equal,

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{2MnO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq}) \rightarrow\text{2MnO}_{2}(\text{s})+\\ \text{Br}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{2OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 5:** Finally, count the hydrogen atoms and add appropriate number of water molecules (i.e. one H2O molecule) on the left side to achieve balanced redox change.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{2MnO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq})+ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\rightarrow\text{2MnO}_{2}(\text{s})\\ \text{+Br}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{2OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**(b) Half Reaction Method:** In this method, the two half equations are balanced separately and then added together to give balanced equation.

Suppose we are to balance the equation showing the oxidation of Fe\({}^{2+}\) ions to Fe\({}^{3+}\) ions by dichromatic ions (Cr2O7\({}^{2-}\) in acidic medium. wherein, Cr2O7\({}^{2-}\) ions are reduced to Cr\({}^{3+}\) ions. The following steps are involved in this task.

**Step 1:** Produce unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})+\text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}( \text{aq})\rightarrow\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 2:** Separate the equation into half-reactions:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Oxidation half}:\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{Fe}^{ 3+}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Reduction half}:\text{Cr}_{2}\,\text{O}_{7}^{2-}( \text{aq})\rightarrow\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

**Step 3:** Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half reaction individually. Here the oxidation half reaction is already balanced with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction half reaction, we multiply the Cr\({}^{3+}\) by 2 to balance Cr atoms.

\(\mathrm{Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2^{-}}(aq)\ \to\ 2\ \mathrm{Cr^{3^{+}}(aq)}}\) (8.53)

**Step 4:** For reactions occurring in acidic medium, add H\({}_{2}\)O to balance O atoms and H\({}^{+}\) to balance H atoms.

Thus, we get :

\(\mathrm{Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2^{-}}(aq)+14H^{+}(aq)\to 2\ \mathrm{Cr^{3^{+}}(aq)+7H_{2}O}}\) (I)

**Step 5:** Add electrons to one side of the half reaction to balance the charges. If need be, make the number of electrons equal in the two half reactions by multiplying one or both half reactions by appropriate coefficients.

The oxidation half reaction is thus rewritten to balance the charge:

\(\mathrm{Fe^{2^{+}}(aq)\ \to\ \mathrm{Fe^{3^{+}}(aq)\ +e^{-}}}\) (8.55)

Now in the reduction half reaction there are net twelve positive charges on the left hand side and only six positive charges on the right hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on the left side.

\(\mathrm{Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2^{-}}(aq)+14H^{+}(aq)+6e^{-}\to 2Cr^{3^{+}}(aq)+7H_{2}O}\) (8.56)

To equalise the number of electrons in both the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation half reaction by 6 and write as :

\(6Fe^{2^{+}}(aq)\to 6Fe^{3^{+}}(aq)+6e^{-}\) (8.57)

**Step 6:** We add the two half reactions to achieve the overall reaction and cancel the electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic equation as :

\(6Fe^{2^{+}}(aq)+Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2^{-}}(aq)+14H^{+}(aq)\to 6Fe^{3^{+}}(aq)+2Cr^{3^{+}}(aq)+7H_{2}O(I)\) (8.58)

**Step 7:** Verify that the equation contains the same type and number of atoms and the same charges on both sides of the equation. This last check reveals that the equation is fully balanced with respect to number of atoms and the charges.

For the reaction in a basic medium, first balance the atoms as is done in acidic medium. Then for each H\({}^{+}\) ion, add an equal number of OH\({}^{+}\) ions to both sides of the equation. Where H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) appear on the same side of the equation, combine these to give H\({}_{2}\)O.

**Problem 8.10**

Permanganate(VII) ion, MnO\({}_{4}^{-}\) in basic solution oxidises iodide ion, I\({}^{-}\) to produce molecular iodine (I\({}_{2}\)) and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\({}_{2}\)). Write a balanced ionic equation to represent this redox reaction.

**Solution**

**Step 1:** First we write the skeletal ionic equation, which is

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)+1^{-}(aq)\to MnO_{2}(s)+I_{2}(s)}\)

**Step 2:** The two half-reactions are:

\(\mathrm{Oxidation\ half:\ \Gamma(aq)\ \to\ I_{2}(s)}\)

\(\mathrm{Reduction\ half:\ \mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)\to\ \mathrm{MnO_{2}(s)}}}\)

**Step 3:** To balance the I atoms in the oxidation half reaction, we rewrite it as:

\(21^{-}(aq)\to 1_{2}(s)\)

**Step 4:** To balance the O atoms in the reduction half reaction, we add two water molecules on the right:

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)\toMnO_{2}(s)+2H_{2}O(I)}\)

To balance the H atoms, we add four H\({}^{+}\) ions on the left:

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)+4H^{+}(aq)\to MnO_{2}(s)+2H_{2}O(I)}\)

As the reaction takes place in a basic solution, therefore, for four H\({}^{+}\) ions, we add four OH\({}^{-}\) ions to both sides of the equation:

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)+4H^{+}(aq)+4OH^{-}(aq)\to}\)

\(\mathrm{MnO_{2}(s)+2H_{2}O(I)+4OH^{-}(aq)}\)

Replacing the H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{+}\) ions with water, the resultant equation is:

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)+2H_{2}O(I)\to MnO_{2}(s)+4OH^{-}(aq)}\)

**Step 5:** In this step we balance the charges of the two half-reactions in the manner depicted as:

\(21^{-}(aq)\to I_{2}(s)+2e^{-}\)

\(\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)+2H_{2}O(I)+3e^{-}\to MnO_{2}(s)}\)

\(\mathrm{+4OH^{-}(aq)}\)

Now to equalise the number of electrons, we multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2.

solution in another beaker and put a zinc rod or stripinit. Now reaction takes place in either of the beakers and at the interface of the metal and its salt solution in each beaker both the reduced and oxidized forms of the same species are present. These represent the species in the reduction and oxidation half reactions. A **redox couple** is defined as having together the oxidised and reduced forms of a substance taking part in an oxidation or reduction half reaction.

This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by a vertical line or a slash representing an interface (e.g. solid/solution). For example in this experiment the two redox couples are represented as Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn and Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu. In both cases, oxidised form is put before the reduced form. Now we put the beaker containing copper sulphate solution and the beaker containing zinc sulphate solution side by side (Fig. 8.3). We connect solutions in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube containing a solution of potassium chloride or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a jelly like substance). This provides an electric contact between the two solutions without allowing them to mix with each other. The zinc and copper rods are connected by a metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter and a switch. The set-upas shown in Fig.8.3is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is in the off position, no reaction takes place in either of the beakers and no current flows through the metallic wire. As soon as the switch is in the on position, we make the following observations:

1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu\({}^{2+}\) but through the metallic wire connecting the two rods as is apparent from the arrow which indicates the flow of current.
2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. We know that the flow of current is possible only if there is a potential difference between the copper and zinc rods known as **electrodes** here.

The potential associated with each electrode is known as **electrode potential**. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any gas appears in the electrode reaction. It is confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and further the reaction is carried out at 298K, then the potential of each electrode is said to be the **Standard Electrode Potential**. By convention, the standard electrode potential (E\({}^{\circ\bullet\bullet}\)of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode process is a measure of the relative tendency of the active species in the process to remain in the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E\({}^{\circ}\) means that the redox couple is a stronger reducing agent than the H\({}^{+}\)/H\({}_{2}\) couple. A positive E\({}^{\circ}\) means that the redox couple is a weaker reducing agent than the H\({}^{+}\)/H\({}_{2}\) couple. The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can get a lot of other useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected electrode processes (reduction reactions) are given in Table 8.1. You will learn more about electrode reactions and cells in Class XII.

## Summary

* Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reducant) have been viewed according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

## Chapter 9 Hydrogen

_Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe and the third most abundant on the surface of the globe, is being visualised as the major future source of energy._

Hydrogen has the simplest atomic structure among all the elements around us in Nature. In atomic form it consists of only one proton and one electron. However, in elemental form it exists as a diatomic (H\({}_{2}\)) molecule and is called dihydrogen. It forms more compounds than any other element. Do you know that the global concern related to energy can be overcome to a great extent by the use of hydrogen as a source of energy? In fact, hydrogen is of great industrial importance as you will learn in this unit.

### 9.1 Position of Hydrogen in the Periodic Table

Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table. However, its placement in the periodic table has been a subject of discussion in the past. As you know by now that the elements in the periodic table are arranged according to their electronic configurations.

Hydrogen has electronic configuration 1 s1. On one hand, its electronic configuration is similar to the outer electronic configuration (\(n\)s1) of alkali metals, which belong to the first group of the periodic table. On the other hand, like halogens (with \(n\)s2np5 configuration belonging to the seventeenth group of the periodic table), it is short by one electron to the corresponding noble gas configuration, helium (1s2). Hydrogen, therefore, has resemblance to alkali metals, which lose one electron to form unipositive ions, as well as with halogens, which gain one electron to form uninegative ion. Like alkali metals, hydrogen forms oxides, halides and sulphides. However, unlike alkali metals, it has a very high ionization enthalpy and does notpossess metallic characteristics under normal conditions. In fact, in terms of ionization enthalpy, hydrogen resembles more with halogens, \(\Delta_{i}H\) of Li is 520 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), F is 1680 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) and that of H is 1312 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). Like halogens, it forms a diatomic molecule, combines with elements to form hydrides and a large number of covalent compounds. However, in terms of reactivity, it is very low as compared to halogens.

Inspite of the fact that hydrogen, to a certain extent resembles both with alkali metals and halogens, it differs from them as well. Now the pertinent question arises as where should it be placed in the periodic table? Loss of the electron from hydrogen atom results in nucleus (H\({}^{+}\)) of \(\sim\) 1.5x10\({}^{-3}\) pm size. This is extremely small as compared to normal atomic and ionic sizes of 50 to 200pm. As a consequence, H\({}^{+}\) does not exist freely and is always associated with other atoms or molecules. Thus, it is unique in behaviour and is, therefore, best placed separately in the periodic table (Unit 3).

### DIHYDROGEN, H\({}_{2}\)

#### 9.2.1 Occurrence

Dihydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe (70% of the total mass of the universe) and is the principal element in the

Since the isotopes have the same electronic configuration, they have almost the same chemical properties. The only difference is in their rates of reactions, mainly due to their different enthalpy of bond dissociation (Table 9.1). However, in physical properties these isotopes differ considerably due to their large mass differences.

### Preparation of Dihydroogen, H\({}_{2}\)

There are a number of methods for preparing dihydrogen from metals and metal hydrides.

#### 9.3.1 Laboratory Preparation of Dihydrogen

(i) It is usually prepared by the reaction of granulated zinc with dilute hydrochloric acid.

Zn + 2H\({}^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2*}\) + H\({}_{2}\)

(ii) It can also be prepared by the reaction of zinc with aqueous alkali.

Zn + 2NaOH \(\rightarrow\) Na\({}_{2}\)ZnO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\) Sodium zincate

#### 9.3.2 Commercial Production of Dihydrogen

The commonly used processes are outlined below:

(i) Electrolysis of acidified water using platinum electrodes gives hydrogen.

(ii) High purity (>99.95%) dihydrogen is obtained by electrolysis warm aqueous barium hydroxide solution between nickel electrodes.

(iii) It is obtained as a byproduct in the manufacture of sodium hydroxide and chlorine by the electrolysis of brine solution. During electrolysis, the reactions that take place are:

at anode: 2Cl(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

at cathode: 2H\({}_{2}\)O (l) + 2e\(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2OH\({}^{-}\)(aq)

The overall reaction is

2Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 2Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

\(\downarrow\)

Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 2OH(aq)

(iv) Reaction of steam on hydrocarbons or coke at high temperatures in the presence of catalyst yields hydrogen.

(v) \(\mathrm{C_{n}H_{2\,n,2}+nH_{2}O\)\(\mathrm{\xrightarrow{1270\,K}}\)\(\mathrm{nCO}+\{3n+1\}H_{2}}\)

e.g.,

(v) \(\mathrm{CH_{4}\,(g)+H_{2}O(g)\)\(\mathrm{\xrightarrow{1270\,K}}\)\(\mathrm{CO}\,(g)+3H_{2}\,(g)}\)

The mixture of CO and H\({}_{2}\) is called _water gas_. As this mixture of CO and H\({}_{2}\) is used for the synthesis of methanol and a number of hydrocarbons, it is also called _synthesis gas_ or'syngas'. Nowadays'syngas' is produced from sewage, saw-dust, scrap wood, newspapers etc. The process of producing'syngas' from coal is called _'coal gasification'_.

The production of dihydrogen can be increased by reacting carbon monoxide of syngas mixtures with steam in the presence of iron chromate as catalyst.

(v) \(\mathrm{CO}\,(g)+H_{2}O(g)\)\(\mathrm{\xrightarrow{673\,K}}\)\(\mathrm{CO}\,(g)+H_{2}\,(g)\)

This is called _water-gas shift reaction_. Carbon dioxide is removed by scrubbing with sodium arsenite solution.

Presently \(\sim\)77% of the industrial dihydrogen is produced from petro-chemicals, 18% from coal, 4% from electrolysis of aqueous solutions and 1% from other sources.

### Properties of Dihydroogen

#### 9.4.1 Physical Properties

Dihydrogen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless, combustible gas. It is lighter than air and insoluble in water. Its other physical properties alongwith those of deuterium are given in Table 9.1.

#### 9.4.2 Chemical Properties

The chemical behaviour of dihydrogen (and for that matter any molecule) is determined, to a large extent, by bond dissociation enthalpy. The H-H bond dissociation enthalpy is the highest for a single bond between two atoms of any element. What inferences would you draw from this fact? It is because of this factor that the dissociation of dihydrogen into its atoms is only \(\sim\)0.081% around 2000K which increases to 95.5% at 5000K. Also, it is relatively inert at room temperature due to the high H-H bond enthalpy. Thus, the atomic hydrogen is produced at a high temperature in an electric arc or under ultraviolet radiations. Since its orbital is incomplete with \(1\,\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{I}}\) electronic configuration, it does combine with almost all the elements. It accomplishes reactions by (i) loss of the only electron to give H+, (ii) gain of an electron to form H-, and (iii) sharing electrons to form a single covalent bond.

The chemistry of dihydrogen can be illustrated by the following reactions:

_Reaction with halogens:_ It reacts with halogens, \(X_{2}\) to give hydrogen halides, HX, \(H_{2}\left(g\right)+X_{2}\left(g\right)\to 2\,\mathrm{HX}\left(g\right)\) (\(X=F,Cl,Br,I\))

While the reaction with fluorine occurs even in the dark, with iodine it requires a catalyst.

_Reaction with dioxygen:_ It reacts with dioxygen to form water. The reaction is highly exothermic.

\(2H_{2}(g)+O_{2}\left(g\right)\xrightarrow{\mathrm{catalyst or heating}}2H_{2}O(I)\):

\(\Delta H^{\Box}=-285.9\,\,\mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\)

_Reaction with dinitrogen:_ With dinitrogen it forms ammonia.

\(3H_{2}\left(g\right)+N_{2}\left(g\right)\xrightarrow{673\,\,\mathrm{K},2\,0\, \mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{t}\mathrm{m}}{Fe}2NH_{3}\left(g\right)\);

\(\Delta H^{\Box}=-92.6\,\,\mathrm{kJ\ mol^{-1}}\)

This is the method for the manufacture of ammonia by the Haber process.

_Reactions with metals:_ With many metals it combines at high a temperature to yield the corresponding hydrides (section 9.5)

\(H_{2}(g)+2M(g)\to 2MH(s)\);

where M is an alkali metal

_Reactions with metal ions and metal oxides:_ It reduces some metal ions in aqueous solution and oxides of metals (less active than iron) into corresponding metals.

\(H_{2}\left(g\right)+Pd^{2+}\left(aq\right)\to Pd(s)+2H^{+}\left(aq\right)\)

\(yH_{2}\left(g\right)+M_{x}O_{y}\left(s\right)\to xM\left(s\right)+yH_{2}O\left( I\right)\)

_Reactions with organic compounds:_ It reacts with many organic compounds in the presence of catalysts to give useful hydrogenated products of commercial importance. For example:

1. **Hydrogenation of vegetable oils using nickel as catalyst gives edible fats (margarine and vanaspati ghee)**
2. **Hydroformylation of olefins yields aldehydes which further undergo reduction to give alcohols.**

\(H_{2}+CO+RCH=CH_{2}\to RCH_{2}CH_{2}CHO\)

\(H_{2}+RCH_{2}CH_{2}CHO\to RCH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}OH\)

**Problem 9.1**

**Comment on the reactions of dihydrogen with (i) chlorine, (ii) sodium, and (iii) copper(II) oxide**

**Solution**

(i) Dihydrogen reduces chlorine into chloride (Cl) ion and itself gets oxidised to H+ ion by chlorine to form hydrogen chloride. An electron pair is shared between H and Cl leading to the formation of a covalent molecule.

(ii) Dihydrogen is reduced by sodium to form NaH. An electron is transferred from Na to H leading to the formation of an ionic compound, Na+H-.

(iii) Dihydrogen reduces copper(II) oxide to copper in zero oxidation state and itself gets oxidised to H2O, which is a covalent molecule.

#### 9.4.3 Uses of Dihydrogen

* The largest single use of dihydrogen is in the synthesis of ammonia which is used in the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrogenous fertilizers.
* Dihydrogen is used in the manufacture of vanaspati fat by the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated vegetable oils like soybean, cotton seeds etc.
* It is used in the manufacture of bulk organic chemicals, particularly methanol.
* It is widely used for the manufacture of metal hydrides (section 9.5)
* It is used for the preparation of hydrogen chloride, a highly useful chemical.

* In metallurgical processes, it is used to reduce heavy metal oxides to metals.
* hydro gen torches find use for cutting and welding purposes. Atomic hydrogen atoms (produced by dissociation of dihydrogen with the help of an electric arc) are allowed to recombine on the surface to be welded to generate the temperature of 4000 K.
* It is used as a rocket fuel in space research.
* Dihydrogen is used in fuel cells for generating electrical energy. It has many advantages over the conventional fossil fuels and electric power. It does not produce any pollution and releases greater energy per unit mass of fuel in comparison to gasoline and other fuels.

### Hydrofides

Dihydrogen, under certain reaction conditions, combines with almost all elements, except noble gases, to form binary compounds, called **hydrides**. If "E" is the symbol of an element then hydride can be expressed as EH\({}_{x}\)(e.g., MgH\({}_{2}\)) or E\({}_{m}\)H\({}_{n}\)(e.g., B\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)).

The hydrides are classified into three categories :

(i) Ionic or saline or saltlike hydrides

(ii) Covalent or molecular hydrides

(iii) Metallic or non -stoichiometric hydrides

#### 9.5.1 Ionic or Saline Hydrides

These are stoichiometric compounds of dihydrogen formed with most of the s-block elements which are highly electropositive in char act er. However, significant covalent character is found in the lighter metal hydrides such as LiH, BeH\({}_{2}\) and MgH\({}_{2}\). In fact BeH\({}_{2}\) and MgH\({}_{2}\) are polymeric in structure. The ionic hydrides are crystalline, non-volatile and non-conducting in solid state. However er, their melts conduct electricity and on electrolysis liberate dihydrogen gas at anode, which confirms the existence of H\({}^{-}\) ion.

Saline hydrides react violently with water producing dihydrogen gas.

\[\mathrm{NaH(s)+H_{2}O(aq)\to NaOH(aq)+H_{2}(g)}\]

Lithium hydride is rather unreactive at moderate temperatures with O\({}_{2}\) or C1\({}_{2}\). It is, therefore, used in the synthesis of other useful hydrides, e.g.,

\[8\mathrm{LiH+Al_{2}C1_{6}\to 2LIAIH_{4}+6LiC1}\]

2LiH + B\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\to 2LiBH_{4}\)

#### 9.5.2 Covalent or Molecular Hydride

Dihydrogen forms molecular compounds with most of the \(p\)-block elements. Most familiar examples are CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF. For convenience hydrogen compounds of non-metals have also been considered as hydrides. Being covalent, they are volatile compounds.

Molecular hydrides are further classified according to the relative numbers of electrons and bonds in their Lewis structure into :

**(i) electron-deficient, (ii) electron-precise, and (iii) electron-rich hydrides.**

An electron-deficient hydride, as the name suggests, has too few electrons for writing its conventional Lewis structure. Diborane (B\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)) is an example. In fact all elements of group 13 will form electron-deficient compounds. What do you expect from their behaviour? They act as Lewis acids i.e., electron acceptors.

Electron-precise compounds have the required number of electrons to write their conventional Lewis structures. All elements of group 14 form such compounds (e.g., CH\({}_{d}\)) which are tetrahedral in geometry.

Electron-rich hydrides have excess electrons which are present as lone pairs. Elements of group 15 - 17 form such compounds. (NH\({}_{3}\) has 1- lone pair, H\({}_{2}\)O - 2 and HF -3 lone pairs). What do you expect from the behaviour of such compounds? They will behave as Lewis bases i.e., electron donors. The presence of lone pairs on highly electronegative atoms like N, O and F in hydrides results in hydrogen bond formation between the molecules. This leads to the association of molecules.

**Problem 9.2**

Would you expect the hydrides of N, O and F to have lower boiling points than the hydrides of their subsequent group members? Give reasons.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:262]

The high heat of vaporisation and heat capacity are responsible for moderation of the climate and body temperature of living beings. It is an excellent solvent for transportation of ions and molecules required for plant and animal metabolism. Due to hydrogen bonding with polar molecules, even covalent compounds like alcohol and carbohydrates dissolve in water.

#### Structure of Water

In the gas phase water is a bent molecule with a bond angle of 104.5\({}^{\circ}\), and O-H bond length of 95.7 pm as shown in Fig 9.1(a). It is a highly polar molecule, (Fig 9.1(b)). Its orbital overlap picture is shown in Fig. 9.1(c). In the liquid phase water molecules are associated together by hydrogen bonds.

The crystalline form of water is ice. At atmospheric pressure ice crystallises in the hexagonal form, but at very low temperatures it condenses to cubic form. Density of ice is less than that of water. Therefore, an ice cube floats on water. In winter season ice formed on the surface of a lake provides thermal insulation which ensures the survival of the aquatic life. This fact is of great ecological significance.

#### Structure of Ice

Ice has a highly ordered three dimensional hydrogen bonded structure as shown in Fig. 9.2. Examination of ice crystals with

Figure 9.1: (a) The bent structure of water; (b) the water molecule as a dipole and (c) the orbital overlap picture in water molecule.

Figure 9.2: The structure of ice

X-rays shows that each oxygen atom is surrounded tetrahedrally by four otheroxygen atoms at a distance of 276 pm.

Hydrogen bonding gives ice a rather open type structure with wide holes. These holes can hold some other molecules of appropriate size interstitially.

6.4 Chemical Properties of Water Water reacts with a large number of substances. Some of the important reactions are given below.

_(1) Amphoteric Nature:_ It has the ability to act as an acid as well as a base i.e., it behaves as an amphoteric substance. In the Bronsted sense it acts as an acid with NH3 and a base with H2S.

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)+\text{NH}_{3}\left(\text{aq}\right) \rightleftharpoons\text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{NH}_{4}^{+}\left( \text{aq}\right)\]

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{S}\left(\text{aq} \right)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{ HS}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

The auto-protolysis (self-ionization) of water takes place a s follows:

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I }\right)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+ \text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

acid-1 base-2 acid-2 base-1 (acid) (base) (conjugate (conjugate acid) base)

_(2) Redox Reactions Involving Water:_ Water can be easily reduced to dihydrogen by highly electropositive metals.

\[2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)+2\text{Na}\left(\text{s}\right) \to 2\text{Na}\text{OH}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\]

Thus, it is a great source of dihydrogen. Water is oxidised to O2 during photosynthesis.

\[6\text{CO}_{2}\text{(g)}+12\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I} \right)\to\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}\left(\text{aq}\right)+6\text{H}_ {2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)\] \[+6\text{O}_{2}\text{(g)}\]

With fluorine also it is oxidised to O2.

2F2(g) + 2H2O(I) \(\to 4\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+4\text{F}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)+ \text{O}_{2}\text{(g)}\)

_(3) Hydrolysis Reaction:_ Due to high dielectric constant, it has a very strong hydrating tendency. It dissolves many ionic compounds. However, certain covalent and someionic compounds are hydrolysed in water.

\[\text{P}_{4}\text{O}_{10}\left(\text{s}\right)+6\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left( \text{I}\right)\to 4\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

\[\text{SiCl}_{4}\left(\text{I}\right)+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I} \right)\to\text{SiO}_{2}\left(\text{s}\right)+4\text{HCl}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

\[\text{N}^{3-}\left(\text{s}\right)+3\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I} \right)\to\text{NH}_{3}\left(\text{g}\right)+3\text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

_(4) Hydrates Formation:_ From aqueous solutions many salts can be crystallised as hydrated salts. Such an association of water is of different types viz.,

\[\left[\text{Cr}\left(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{3+}3\text{Cl}^{-}\]

\[\left[\text{iii)}\text{nteristialwatere.g., BaCl}_{2}.2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{iii)hydrogen-bondedwatere.g.,}\right.\]

\[\left[\text{Cu}\left(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}\text{SO}_{4} ^{2-}.\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{ in }\text{CuSO}_{4}.5\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{,}\]

**Problem 9.4**:
**How many hydrogen-bondedwater molecule(s) are associated in CuSO4.5H2O? Solution Only one water molecule, which is outside the brackets (coordination sphere), is hydrogen-bonded. The other four molecules of water are coordinated.**

#### 9.6.5 Hard and Soft Water

Rain water is almost pure (may contain some dissolved gases from the atmosphere). Being a good solvent, when it flows on the surface of the earth, it dissolves many salts. Presence of calcium and magnesium salts in the form of hydrogencarbonate, chloride and sulphate in water makes water '**hard**'. **Hard water does not give latter with soap. Water free from soluble salts of calcium and magnesium is called **Soft water**. It gives lather with soap easily.

Hard water forms scum/precipitate with soap. Soap containing sodium stearate (C17H35COONa) reacts with hard water to precipitate out Ca/Mg stearate.

\[2\text{C}_{17}\text{H}_{35}\text{COONa}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{M}^{2+} \left(\text{aq}\right)\to\]

\[\left(\text{C}_{17}\text{H}_{35}\text{COO}\right)_{2}\text{M}\downarrow+2\text{ Na}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\text{;}\text{MisCa/Mg}\]

It is, therefore, unsuitable for laundry. It is harmful for boilers as well, because of deposition of salts in the form of scale. This reduces the efficiency of the boiler. The hardness of water is of two types: (i) temporary hardness, and (ii) permanent hardness.

9.6.6 Temporary Hardness Temporary hardness is due to the presence of magnesium and calcium hydrogen-carbonates. It can be removed by :

_(i) Boiling:_ During boiling, the soluble Mg(HCO3)2 is converted into insoluble Mg(OH)2 and Ca(HCO3)2 is changed to insoluble CaCO3. It is because of high solubility product of Mg(OH)2 as compared to that of MgCO3, that Mg(OH)2 is precipitated. These precipitates can be removed by filtration. Filtrate thus obtained will be soft water.

(ii) Clark's method:In this method calculated amount of lime is added to hard water. It precipitates out calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide which can be filtered off.

(i) \(\mathrm{Mg(HCO_{3})_{2}+Ca(OH)_{2}\to 2CaCO_{3}\downarrow+2H_{2}O}\)

(ii) \(\mathrm{Mg(HCO_{3})_{2}+2Ca(OH)_{2}\to 2CaCO_{3}\downarrow}\)

\(\mathrm{+Mg(OH)_{2}\downarrow+2H_{2}O}\)

#### 9.6.7 Permanent Hardness

It is due to the presence of soluble salts of magnesium and calcium in the form of chlorides and sulphates in water. Permanent hardness is not removed by boiling. It can be removed by the following methods:

_(i) Treatment with washing soda (sodium carbonate):_Washing soda reacts with soluble calcium and magnesium chlorides and sulphates in hard water to form insoluble carbonates

(ii) \(\mathrm{MCl_{2}+Na_{2}CO_{3}\to\mathrm{MCO_{3}\downarrow+2NaCl}}\)

(M = Mg, Ca)

(iii) \(\mathrm{MSO_{4}+Na_{2}CO_{3}\to\mathrm{MCO_{3}\downarrow+Na_{2}SO_{4}}}\)

_(ii) Calgon's method:_ Sodium hexematPhosphate (Na6P6O18), commercially called 'calgon', when added to hard water, the following reactions take place.

(i) \(\mathrm{Na_{6}P_{6}O_{18}\to 2Na^{+}Na_{4}P_{6}O_{18}^{2-}}\)

(M = Mg, Ca)

(M = Mg, Ca)

(M = Mg, Ca)

(M = Mg, Ca)

(M = Mg, Ca)

Permuti/zeolite is said to be exhausted when all the sodium in it is used up. It is regenerated for further use by treating with an aqueous sodium chloride solution.

(iv) \(\mathrm{Synthetic\ resins\ method}\):Nowadays hard water is softened by using synthetic cation exchangers This method is more efficient than zeolite process. Cation exchange resins contain large organic molecule with - SO3H group and are water insoluble. Ion exchange resin (RSO3H) is changed to RNA by treating it with NaCl. The resin exchanges Na' ions with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions present in hard water to make the water soft. Here R is resin anion.

(8) \(\mathrm{M^{2}+Na_{2}CO_{3}\to\mathrm{MCO_{3}\downarrow+2Na^{+}(aq)}}\)

The resin can be regenerated by adding aqueous NaCl solution.

Pure de-mineralised (de-ionized) water free from all soluble mineral salts is obtained by passing water successively through a cation exchange (in the H+ form) and an anion-exchange (in the OH+ form) resins:

(4) \(\mathrm{2RH(s)+M^{2+}(aq)\rightleftharpoons\mathrm{MR_{2}(s)+2H^{+}(aq)}}\)

In this cation exchange process, H+ exchanges for Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and other cations present in water. This process results in proton release and thus makes the water addic. In the anion exchange process:\[\begin{split}\text{RNH}_{2}\left(\mathbf{s}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \left(\text{I}\right)\rightleftharpoons\text{RNH}_{3}^{+}\text{OH}^{-}( \mathbf{s})\\ \text{RNH}_{3}^{+}\text{OH}^{-}(\mathbf{s})+\text{X}^{-}( \text{aq})\rightleftharpoons\text{RNH}_{3}^{+}\text{X}^{-}(\mathbf{s})\\ +\text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\end{split}\]

OH \({}^{-}\)exchanges for anions like Cl \({}^{-}\), HCO\({}_{3}^{-}\) SO\({}_{4}^{2-}\) etc. present in water. OH \({}^{-}\) ions, thus, liberated neutralise the H \({}^{+}\) ions set free in the cation exchange.

\[\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\to \text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)\]

The exhausted cation and anion exchange resin beds are regenerated by treatment with dilute acid and alkali solutions respectively.

### HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\))

Hydrogen peroxide is an important chemical used in pollution control treatment of domestic andindustrial effluents.

#### 9.7.1 Preparation

It can be prepared by the following methods.

(i) Acidifying barium peroxide and removing excess water by evaporation under reduced pressure gives hydrogen peroxide.

\[\begin{split}\text{BaO}_{2}.8\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\mathbf{s} \right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\left(\mathbf{aq}\right)\to\text{BaSO}_{4} \left(\mathbf{s}\right)+\\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+8\text{H}_{2}\text{O }\left(\text{I}\right)\end{split}\]

(ii) Peroxodisulphate, obtained by electrolytic oxidation of acidified sulphate solutions at high current density, on hydrolysis yields hydrogen peroxide.

\[\begin{split} 2\text{HSO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})&\xrightarrow{ \text{Electradysis}}\text{HO}_{3}\text{SOOSO}_{3}\text{H}(\text{aq})\\ \xrightarrow{\text{Hydrolysis}}& 2\text{HSO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+2 \text{H}^{+}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\end{split}\]

This method is now used for the laboratory preparation of D\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\).

\[\text{K}_{2}\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}(\mathbf{s})+2\text{D}_{2}\text{O}(1) \to 2\text{KIDSO}_{4}(\text{aq})+\text{D}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{I}\right)\]

(iii) Industrially it is prepared by the auto-oxidation of 2-alkylanthraquinols.

\[\begin{split} 2-\text{ethylanthraquinol}&\xrightarrow{ \text{O}_{2}\left(\text{air}\right)}\xrightarrow{\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}}+\\ \text{(oxidised product)}\end{split}\]

In this case 1% H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is formed. It is extracted with water and concentrated to \(\sim\)30% (by mass) by distillation under reduced pressure. It can be further concentrated to \(\sim\) 85% by careful distillation under low pressure. The remaining water can be frozen out to obtain pure H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\).

#### 9.7.2 Physical Properties

In the pure state H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is an almost colourless (very pale blue) liquid. Its important physical properties are given in Table 9.4.

H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is miscible with water in all proportions and forms a hydrate H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\).H\({}_{2}\)O (mp 221K). A 30% solution of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is marketed as 100 volume hydrogen peroxide. It means that one millilitre of 30% H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) solution will give 100 V of oxygen at STP. Commercally, it is marketed as 10 V, which means it contains 3% H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\).

**Problem 9.4**

Calculate the strength of 10 volume solution of hydrogen peroxide.

**Solution**

10 volume solution of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) means that 1L of this H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) will give 10 L of oxygen at STP

2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\left(\text{I}\right)\to\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{H}_{2} \text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)\)

2x34 g 22.4 L at STP

68 g

22.4 L of O\({}_{2}\) at STP is produced from H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) = 68 g

10 L of O\({}_{2}\) at STP is produced from.

H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) = 68\(\times\)10

22.4 S = 30.36 g

Therefore, strength of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) in 10 volume

H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) = 30.36 g/L

Table 9.4: Physical Properties of Hydrogen Peroxide

#### 9.7.3 Structure

Hydrogen peroxide has a non-planar structure. Themolecular dimensions in the gas phase and solid phase are shown in Fig 9.3

#### 9.7.4 Chemical Properties

It actsas anoxidising as well as reducing agent in both acidic and alkaline media. Simple reactions are described below.

(i) Oxidising action in acidic medium

\[2\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2\mathrm{H}^{*}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})\rightarrow\] \[2\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}(\mathrm{aq})+2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}(1)\] \[\mathrm{PbS}(\mathrm{s})+4\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{ aq})\rightarrow\mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{s})+4\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}(1)\]

(ii) Reducing action in acidic medium

\[2\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+6\mathrm{H}^{+}+5\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\to 2 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+8\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}+5\mathrm{O}_{2}\] \[\mathrm{HOCI}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{H}_{3 }\mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\]

(iii) Oxidising action in basic medium

\[\dot{2}\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+2\mathrm{OH}^{-}\] \[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{4+}+2\mathrm{OH}^{-}\]

(iv) Reducing action in basic medium

\[\mathrm{I}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}+2\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{I}^{-}+2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\] \[2\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+3\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{MnO}_{2}+3\mathrm{O}_{2}+\] \[2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}+2\mathrm{OH}^{-}\]

#### 9.7.5 Storage

\(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\) decomposes slowly on exposure to light.

\[2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{I})\rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{I})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{g})\]

In the presence of metal surfaces or traces of alkali (present in glass containers), the above reaction is catalysed. It is, therefore, stored in wax-lined glass or plastic vessels in dark. Urea can be added as a stabiliser. It is kept away from dust because dust can induce explosive decomposition of the compound.

#### 9.7.6 Uses

Its wide scale use has led to tremendous increase in the industrial production of \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\). Some of the uses arelisted below:

(i) In daily life it is used as a hair bleach and as a mild disinfectant. As an antiseptic it is sold in the market as perhydrol.

(ii) It is used to manufacture chemicals like sodium perborate and per-carbonate, which are used in high quality detergents.

(iii) It is used in the synthesis of hydroquinone, tartaric acid and certain food products and pharmaceuticals (cephalosporin) etc.

(iv) It is employed in the industries as a bleaching agent for textiles, paper pulp, leather, oils, fats, etc.

(v) Nowadays it is also used in Environmental (Green) Chemistry. For example, in pollution control treatment of domestic and industrial effluents, oxidation of cyanides, restoration of aerobic conditions to sewage wastes, etc.

### Heavy Water, \(\mathrm{D}_{2}\mathrm{O}\)

It is extensively used as a moderator in nuclear reactors and in exchange reactions for the study of reaction mechanisms. It can be prepared by exhaustive electrolysis of water or as a by-product in some fertilizer industries. Its physical properties are given in Table 9.3. It is used for the preparation of other deuterium compounds, for example:

\[\mathrm{CaC}_{2}+2\mathrm{D}_{2}\mathrm{O}\rightarrow\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{D}_{2}+\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{OD}\right)_{2}\] \[\mathrm{SO}_{3}+\mathrm{D}_{2}\mathrm{O}\rightarrow\mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\] \[\mathrm{Al}_{4}\mathrm{C}_{3}+12\mathrm{D}_{2}\mathrm{O} \rightarrow 3\mathrm{CD}_{4}+4\mathrm{Al}\left(\mathrm{OD}\right)_{3}\]

### Dihydrogen as a Fuel

Dihydrogen releases large quantities of heat on combustion. The data on energy released by combustion of fuels like dihydrogen, methane, LPG etc. are compared in terms of the same

Figure 9.3: (a) \(H_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\) structure in gas phase, dihedral angle is 111.5°. (b) \(H_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\) structure in solid phase at 110K, dihedral angle is 90.2°.

amounts in mole, mass and volume, are shown in Table 9.3.

From this table it is clear that on a mass for mass basis dihydrogen can release more energy than petrol (about three times). Moreover, pollutants in combustion of dihydrogen will be less than petrol. The only pollutants will be the oxides of dinitrogen (due to the presence of dinitrogen as impurity with dihydrogen). This, of course, can be minimised by injecting a small amount of water into the cylinder to lower the temperature so that the reaction between dinitrogen and dioxygen may not take place. However, the mass of the containers in which dihydrogen will be kept must be taken into consideration. A cylinder of compressed dihydrogen weighs about 30 times as much as a tank of petrol containing the same amount of energy. Also, dihydrogen gas is converted into liquid state by cooling to 20K. This would require expensive insulated tanks. Tanks of metal alloy like NaNi\({}_{5}\), Tl-TiH\({}_{2}\), Mg-MgH\({}_{2}\) etc. are in use for storage of dihydrogen in small quantities. These energy.

## Summary

Hydrogen is the lightest atom with only one electron. Loss of this electron results in an elementary particle, the proton. Thus, it is unique in character. It has three isotopes, namely : **protium** (\({}^{1}_{1}\)H), **deuterium** (D or \({}^{2}_{1}\)H) and **tritium** (T or\({}^{3}_{1}\)H). Amongst these three, only tritium is radioactive. Inspite of its resemblance both with alkali metals and halogens, it occupies a separate position in the periodic table because of its unique properties.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. In the free state it is almost not found in the earth's atmosphere. However, in the combined state, it is the third most abundant element on the earth's surface.

Dihydrogen on the industrial scale is prepared by the **water-gas shift** reaction from petrochemicals. It is obtained as a byproduct by the electrolysis of brine.

The H-H **bond dissociation enthalpy** of dihydrogen (435.88 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) is the highest for a single bond between two atoms of any elements. This property is made use of in the atomic hydrogen torch which generates a temperature of \(\sim\)4000K and is ideal for welding of high melting metals.

Though dihydrogen is rather inactive at room temperature because of very high negative dissociation enthalpy, it combines with almost all the elements under appropriate conditions to form **hydrid es.** All the type of hydrides can be classified into three categories: ionic or saline hydrides, covalent or molecular hydrides and metallic or non-stoichiometric hydrides. Alkali metal hydrides are good reagents for preparing other hydride compounds. Molecular hydrides (e.g., B\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\), CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O) are of great importance in day-to-day life. Metallic hydrides are useful for ultrapurification of dihydrogen and as dihydrogen storage media.

Among the other chemical reactions of dihydrogen, **reducing reactions** leading to the formation hydrogen halides, water, ammonia, methanol, vanaspati ghee, etc. are of great importance. In metallurgical process, it is used to reduce metal oxides. In space programmes, it is used as a rocket fuel. In fact, it has promising potential for use as a non-polluting fuel of the near future **(Hydrogen Economy)**.

Water is the most common and abundantly available substance. It is of a great chemical and biological significance. The ease with which water is transformed from liquid to solid and to gaseous state allows it to play a vital role in the **biosphere.** The water molecule is highly polar in nature due to its bent structure. This property leads to hydrogen bonding which is the maximum in ice and least in water vapour. The polar nature of water makes it: (a) a very good solvent for ionic and partially ionic compounds; (b) to act as an amphoteric (acid as well as base) substance; and (c) to form hydrates of different types. Its property to dissolve many salts, particularly in large quantity, makes it hard and hazardous for industrial use. Both temporary and permanent **hardness** can be removed by the use of zeolites, and synthetic ion-exchangers.

**Heavy water,** D\({}_{2}\)O is another important compound which is manufactured by the electrolytic enrichment of normal water. It is essentially used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.

**Hydrogen peroxide,** H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) has an interesting non-polar structure and is widely used as an industrial bleach and in pharmaceutical and pollution control treatment of industrial and domestic effluents.

## Chapter 10 The s -Block Elements

The first element of alkali and alkaline earth metals differs in many respects from the other members of the group

The s-block elements of the Periodic Table are those in which the last electron enters the outermost s-orbital. As the s-orbital can accommodate only two electrons, two groups (1 & 2) belong to the s-block of the Periodic Table. Group 1 of the Periodic Table consists of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium. They are collectively known as the alkali metals. These are so called because they form hydroxides on reaction with water which are strongly alkaline in nature. The elements of Group 2 include beryllium. magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. These elements with the exception of beryllium are commonly known as the alkaline earth metals. These are so called because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature and these metal oxides are found in the earth's crust1.

Footnote 1: The thin, rocky outer layer of the Earth is crust. \({}^{\dagger}\) A type of rock formed from magma molten rock that has cooled and hardened.

Among the alkali metals sodium and potassium are abundant and lithium, rubidium and caesium have much lower abundances (Table 10.1). Francium is highly radioactive; its longest-lived isotope \({}^{223}\)Fr has a half-life of only 21 minutes. Of the alkaline earth metals calcium and magnesium rank fifth and sixth in abundance respectively in the earth's crust. Strontium and barium have much lower abundances. Beryllium is rare and radium is the rarest of all comprising only 10\({}^{-10}\) per cent of igneous rocks2 (Table 10.2, page 299).

Footnote 2: The first element of alkali and alkaline earth metals differs in many respects from the other members of the group

The general electronic configuration of s-block elements is [noble gas]\(ns^{1}\) for alkali metals and [noble gas] \(ns^{2}\) for alkaline earth metals.

Lithium and beryllium, the first elements of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively exhibit some properties which are different from those of the other members of the respective group. In these anomalous properties they resemble the second element of the following group. Thus, lithium shows similarities to magnesium and beryllium to aluminium in many of their properties. This type of diagonal similarity is commonly referred to as _diagonal relationship_ in the periodic table. The diagonal relationship is due to the similarity in ionic sizes and /or charge/radius ratio of the elements. Monovalent sodium and potassium ions and divalent magnesium and calcium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These ions perform important biological functions such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction.

10.1 GROUP 1 ELEMENTS: ALKALI METALS

The alkali metals show regular trends in their physical and chemical properties with the increasing atomic number. The atomic, physical and chemical properties of alkali metals are discussed below.

10.1.1 Electronic Configuration

All the alkali metals have one valence electron, \(ns^{1}\) (Table 10.1) outside the noble gas core. The loosely held s-electron in the outermost valence shell of these elements makes them the most electropositive metals. They readily lose electron to give monovalent M' ions. Hence they are never found in free state in nature.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|l|} \hline
**Element** & **Symbol** & **Electronic configuration** \\ \hline Lithium & Li & 1s\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{1}\) \\ Sodium & Na & 1s\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{2}\)p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{1}\) \\ Potassium & K & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)4s\({}^{1}\) \\ Rubidium & Rb & 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{2}\)4p\({}^{6}\)5s\({}^{1}\) \\ Caesium & Cs & 1s\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{2}\) \\  & & 4p\({}^{6}\)4d\({}^{10}\)5s\({}^{2}\)5p\({}^{6}\)6s\({}^{1}\) or [Xe] 6s\({}^{1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

10.1.2 Atomic and Ionic Radii

The alkali metal atoms have the largest sizes in a particular period of the periodic table. With increase in atomic number, the atom becomes larger. The monovalent ions (M') are smaller than the parent atom. The atomic and ionic radii of alkali metals increase on moving down the group i.e., they increase in size while going from Li to Cs.

10.1.3 Ionization Enthalpy

The ionization enthalpies of the alkali metals are considerably low and decrease down the group from Li to Cs. This is because the effect of increasing size outweighs the increasing nuclear charge, and the outermost electronis very well screened from the nuclear charge.

10.1.4 Hydration Enthalpy

The hydration enthalpies of alkali metal ions decrease with increase in ionic sizes.

Li\({}^{*}\) > Na\({}^{*}\) > K\({}^{*}\) > Rb\({}^{*}\) > Cs\({}^{*}\)

Li\({}^{*}\) has maximum degree of hydration and for this reason lithium salts are mostly hydrated, e.g., LiCl\({}^{*}\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O

10.1.5 Physical Properties

All the alkali metals are sivery white, soft and light metals. Because of the large size, these elements have low density which increases down the group from Li to Cs. However, potassium is lighter than sodium. The melting and boiling points of the alkali metals are low indicating weak metallic bonding due to the presence of only a single valence electron in them. The alkali metals and their saltsimpart characteristic colour to an oxidizing flame. This is because the heat from the flame excites the outermost orbital electron to a higher energy level. When the excited electron comes back to the ground state, there is emission of radiation in the visible region as given below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Metal** & **Li** & **Na** & **K** & **Rb** & **Cs** \\ \hline Colour & Crimson & Yellow & Violet & Red & Blue \\  & red & & & & violet & \\ \hline \(\lambda\)/nm & 670.8 & 589.2 & 766.5 & 780.0 & 455.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Alkali metals can therefore, be detected by the respective flame tests and can be determined by flame photometry or atomic absorption spectroscopy. These elements when irradiated with light, the light energy absorbed may be sufficient to make an atom lose electron.

This property makes caesium and potassium useful as electrodes in photoelectric cells.

#### Chemical Properties

The alkali metals are highly reactive due to their large size and low ionization enthalpy. The reactivity of these metals increases down the group.

_Reactivity towards air:_ The alkali metals ternish in dry air due to the formation of their oxides which in turn react with moisture to form hydroxides. They burn vigorously in oxygen forming oxides. Lithium forms monoxide, sodium forms peroxide, the other metals form superoxides. The superoxide O\({}_{2}^{-}\) ion is stable only in the presence of large cations such as K, Rb, Cs.

\({}^{\dagger}\)Li +O\({}_{2}\rightarrow\)2 Li\({}_{2}\)O (oxide)

\({}^{\dagger}\)Zn Na +O\({}_{2}\rightarrow\)Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(peroxide)

\({}^{\dagger}\)M +O\({}_{2}\rightarrow\)MO\({}_{2}\)(superoxide)

(M = K, Rb, Cs)

In all these oxides the oxidation state of the alkali metal is +1. Lithium shows exceptional behaviour in reacting directly with nitrogen of air to form the nitride, Li\({}_{3}\)N as well. Because of their high reactivity towards air an d water, they are normally kept in kerosene oil.

**Problem 10.1**

What is the oxidation state of K in KO\({}_{2}\)?

**Solution**

The superoxide species is represented as O\({}_{2}^{-}\); since the compound is neutral, therefore, the oxidation state of potassium is +1.

\end{table}
Table 10.1: Atomic and Physical Properties of the Alkali Metals* _Reactivity towards water:_ The alkali metals react with water to form hydroxide and dihydrogen. (M + 2H2O \(\rightarrow\)2M^+ 2OH^+ H2 (M = an alkali metal) It may be noted that although lithium has most negative \(\mathrm{E}^{\odot}\) value (Table 10.1), its reaction with water is less vigorous than that of sodium which has the least negative \(\mathrm{E}^{\odot}\) value among the alkali metals. This behaviour of lithium is attributed to its small size and very high hydration energy. Other metals of the group react explosively with water. They also react with proton donors such as alcohol, gaseous ammonia and alkynes.
* _Reactivity towards dihydrogen:_ The alkali metals react with dihydrogen at about 673K (lithium at 1073K) to form hydrides. All the alkali metal hydrides are ionic solids with high melting points. (_iv) Reactivity towards halogens:_ The alkali metals readily react vigorously with halogens to form ionic halides, M^+X^-However, lithium halides are somewhat covalent. It is because of the high polarisation capability of lithium ion (The distortion of electron cloud of the anion by the cation is called polarisation). The Li^ ion isvery small in size and has high tendency to distort electron cloud around the negative halide ion. Since anion with large size can be easily distorted, among halides, lithium iodide is the most covalent in nature.
* _Reducing nature:_ The alkali metals are strong reducing agents, lithium being the most and sodium the least powerful (Table 10.1). The standard electrode potential(\(\mathrm{E}^{\odot}\)) which measures the reducing power represents the overall change : M(s) \(\rightarrow\)M(g) sublimation enthalpy  M(g) \(\rightarrow\)M^+(g) + e^ ionizationenthalpy  M^+(g) + H2O \(\rightarrow\)M^+(aq) hydration enthalpy  With the small size of its ion, lithium has the highest hydration enthalpy which accounts for its high negative \(\mathrm{E}^{\odot}\) value and its high reducing power.

**Problem 10.2**

The \(\mathrm{E}^{\odot}\) for \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\)/\(\mathrm{Cl}^{*}\) is + 0.53, for Ag^+/Ag is +0.79. Na^+/Na is -2.71 and for Li^+/Li is -3.04. Arrange the following ionic species in decreasing order of reducing strength:

**Solution**

The order is Li > Na > I^+> Ag > Cl^-

* _Solutions in liquid ammonia:_ The alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia giving deep blue solutions which are conducting :in nature.  M+(x + y)NH3 \(\rightarrow\)[M(NH3)x]^+[e(NH3)y]^-The blue colour of the solution is due to the ammoniated electron which absorbs energy in the visible region of light and thus imparts blue colour to the solution. The solutions are paramagnetic and on standing slowly liberate hydrogen resulting in the formation of amide. (where 'am' denotes solution in ammonia.) In concentrated solution, the blue colour changes to bronze colour and becomes diamagnetic.

#### 10.1.7 Uses

Lithium metal is used to make useful alloys, for example with lead to make 'white metal' bearings for motor engines, with aluminium to make aircraft parts, and with magnesium to make armour plates. It is used in thermonuclear reactions Lithium is also used to make electrochemical cells. Sodium is used to make a Na/Pb alloy needed to make PbEt4 and PbMe4. These organolead compounds were earlier used as anti-knock additives to petrol, but nowadays vehicles use lead-free petrol. Liquid sodium metal is used as a coolant in fast breeder nuclear reactors. Potassium hasa vital role in biological systems. Potassium chloride is used as a fertilizer. Potassium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of soft soap. It is also used as an excellent absorbent of carbon dioxide. Caesium is used in devising photoelectric cells.

### GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE ALKIAL METALS

All the common compounds of the alkali metals are generally ionic in nature. General characteristics of some of their compoundsare discussed here.

### Oxides and Hydroxides

On combustion in excess of a ir, lithium forms mainly the oxide, Li\({}_{2}\)O (plus some peroxide Li\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)), sodium forms the peroxide, Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) (and some superoxide NaO\({}_{2}\)) whilst potassium, rubidium and caesium form the superoxides, MO\({}_{2}\). Under appropriate conditions pure compounds M\({}_{2}\)O, M\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and MO\({}_{2}\) may be prepared. The increasing stability of the peroxide or superoxide, as the size of the metal ion increases, is due to the stabilisation of large anions by larger cations through lattice energy effects. These oxides are easily hydrolysed by water to form the hydroxides a according to the following reactions:

\[\mathrm{M}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\to 2\mathrm{M}^{+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}\]

\[\mathrm{M}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}+2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\to 2\mathrm{M}^{+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\]

\[2\mathrm{MO}_{2}+2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\to 2\mathrm{M}^{+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\]

The oxides and the peroxididesare colourless when pure, but the superoxides are yellow or orange in colour. The superoxides are also paramagnetic. Sodium peroxide is widely used as an oxidising agent in inorganic chemistry.

**Problem 10.3**

Why is KO\({}_{2}\) paramagnetic?

**Solution**

The superoxide O\({}_{2}\) is paramagnetic because of one unpaired electron in \(\pi^{*}2p\) molecular orbital.

The hydroxides which are obtained by the reaction of the oxides with water are all white crystall in solids. The alkali metal hydroxides are the strongest of all bases and dissolve freely in water with evolution of much heat on account of intense hydration.

### Halides

The alkali metal halides, MX, (X=F,Cl,Br,I) are all high melting, colourless crystalline solids. They can be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with aqueous hydrohalic acid (HX). All of these halides have high negative enthalpies of formation; the \(\Delta_{f}H^{\odot}\) values for fluorides become less negative as we go down the group, whilst the reverse is true for \(\Delta_{f}H^{\odot}\) for chlorides, bromides and iodides. For a given metal \(\Delta_{f}H^{\odot}\) always becomes less negative from fluoride to iodide.

The melting and boiling points always follow the trend: fluoride > chloride > bromide > iodide. All these halides are soluble in water. The low solubility of LiF in water is due to its high lattice enthalpy whereas thelow solubility of CsI is due to smaller hydration enthalpy of its two ions. Other halides of lithium are soluble in ethanol, acetone and ethylacetate; LiCl is soluble in pyridine also.

### Salts of Oxo-Acids

Oxo-acids are those in which the acidic proton is on a hydroxyl group with an oxo group attached to the same atom e.g., carbonic acid, H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) (OC(OH)\({}_{2}\); sulphuric acid, H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (O\({}_{2}\)S(OH)\({}_{2}\)). The alkali metals form salts with all the oxo-acids. They are generally soluble in water and thermally stable. Their carbonates (M\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)) and in most cases the hydrogen carbonates (MHCO\({}_{3}\)) also are highly stable to heat. As the electropositive character increases down the group, the stability of the carbonates and hydrogencarbonates in creases. Lithium carbonate is not so stable to heat; lithium being very small in size polarises a large CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\) ion leading to the formation of more stable Li\({}_{2}\)O and CO\({}_{2}\). Its hydrogencarbonate does not exist as a solid.

### Anomalous Properties of Lithium

The anomalous behaviour of lithium is due to the : (i) exceptionally small size of its atom and ion, and (ii) high polarising power (i.e., charge/radius ratio). As a result, there is increased covalent character of lithium compounds which is responsible for their solubility in organic solvents. Further, lithium shows diagonal relationship to magnesium which has been discussed subsequently.

### Points of Difference between Lithium and other Alkali Metals

(ii) Lithium is much harder. Its m.p. and b.p. are higher than the other alkali metals.

(ii) Lithium is least reactive but the strongest reducing agent among all the alkali metals. On combustion in air it forms mainly monoxide, Li\({}_{2}\)O and the nitride, Li\({}_{3}\)N unlike other alkali metals.

(iii) LiCl is deliquescent and crystallises as a hydrate, LiCl.2H\({}_{2}\)O whereas other alkali metal chlorides do not form hydrates.

(iv) Lithium hydrogencarbonate is not obtained in the solid form while all other elements form solid hydrogencarbonates.

(v) Lithium unlike other alkali metals forms no ethylide on reaction with ethyne.

(vi) Lithium nitrate when heated gives lithium oxide, Li\({}_{2}\)O, whereas other alkali metal nitrates decompose to give the corresponding nitrite.

\(4\,\mathrm{LiNO}_{3}\to 2\,\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}+4\,\mathrm{NO}_{2}+ \mathrm{O}_{2}\)

\(2\,\mathrm{Na}\,\mathrm{NO}_{3}\to 2\,\mathrm{Na}\mathrm{NO}_{2}+ \mathrm{O}_{2}\)

(vii) LiF and Li\({}_{2}\)O are comparatively much less soluble in water than the corresponding compounds of other alkali metals.

### Points of Similarities between Lithium and Magnesium

The similarity between lithium and magnesium is particularly striking and arises because of their similar sizes : atomic radii. Li = 152 pm, Mg = 160 pm; ionic radii : Li\({}^{+}\) = 76 pm, Mg\({}^{2+}\)= 72 pm. The main points of similarity are:

(i) Both lithium and magnesium are harder and lighter than other elements in the respective groups.

(ii) Lithium and magnesium react slowly with water. Their oxides and hydroxides are much less soluble and their hydroxides decompose on heating. Both form a nitride, Li\({}_{3}\)N and Mg\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{2}\), by direct combination with nitrogen.

(iii) The oxides, Li\({}_{2}\)O and MgO do not combine with excess oxygen to give any superoxide.

(iv) The carbonates of lithium and magnesium decompose easily on heating to form the oxides and CO\({}_{2}\). Solid hydrogencarbonates are not formed by lithium and magnesium.

(v) Both LiCl and MgCl\({}_{2}\) are soluble in ethanol.

(vi) Both LiCl and MgCl\({}_{2}\) are deliquescent and crystallise from aqueous solution as hydrates, LiCl:2H\({}_{2}\)O and MgCl\({}_{2}\cdot\)8H\({}_{2}\)O.

### Some Important Compounds of Sodium

Industrially important compounds of sodium include sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. The large scale production of these compounds and their uses are described below:

_Sodium Carbonate (Washing Soda), Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)10H\({}_{2}\)O_

**Sodium carbonate is generally prepared by Solvay Process. In this process, advantage is taken of the low solubility of sodium hydrogencarbonate whereby it gets precipitated in the reaction of sodium chloride with ammonium hydrogencarbonate. The latter is prepared by passing CO\({}_{2}\) to a concentrated solution of sodium chloride saturated with ammonia, where ammonium carbonate followed by ammonium hydrogencarbonate are formed. The equations for the complete process may be written as :**

\(2\,\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}\rightarrow\left( \mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}\)

\(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}+ \mathrm{CO}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{2}\,\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\)

\(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{HCO}_{3}+\mathrm{NaCl}\rightarrow\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl}+ \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\)

**Sodium hydrogencarbonate crystal separates. These are heated to give sodium carbonate.**\({}^{2}\)NaHCO\({}_{3}\rightarrow\)Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}+\)CO\({}_{2}+\)H\({}_{2}\)O

In this process NH\({}_{3}\) is recovered when the solution containing NH\({}_{4}\)Cl is treated with Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\). Calcium chloride is obtained as a by-product.

\({}^{2}\)NH\({}_{4}\)Cl + Ca (OH)\({}_{2}\rightarrow\)2 NH\({}_{3}\) + CaCl\({}_{2}+\)H\({}_{2}\)O

It may be mentioned here that Solvay process cannot be extended to the manufacture of potassium carbonate because potassium hydrogencarbonate is too soluble to be precipitated by the addition of ammonium hydrogencarbonate to a saturated solution of potassium chloride.

_Properties :_ Sodium carbonate is a white crystalline solid which exists as a decahydrate, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)\(\cdot\)10H\({}_{2}\)O. This is also called washing soda. It is readily soluble in water. On heating, the decahydrate loses its water of crystallisation to form monohydrate. Above 373K, the monohydrate becomes completely anhydrous and changes to a white powder called soda ash.

\({}^{3}\)Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)\(\cdot\)10H\({}_{2}\)O - 375K Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)\(\cdot\)H\({}_{2}\)O - 373K Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}+\)H\({}_{2}\)O

Carbonate part of sodium carbonate gets hydrolys by water to form an alkaline solution.

\({}^{3}\)CO\({}_{3}^{2}+\)H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\)HCO\({}_{3}^{-}+\)OH\({}^{-}\)

_Uses:_

* It is used in water softening, laundering and cleaning.
* It is used in the manufacture of glass, soap, borax and caustic soda.
* It is used in paper, paints and textile industries.
* It is an important laboratory reagent both in qualitative and quantitative analysis.

_Sodium Chloride_, NaCl

The most abundant source of sodium chloride is sea water which contains 2.7 to 2.9% by mass of the salt. In tropical countries like India, common salt is generally obtained by evaporation of sea water. Approximately 50 lakh tons of salt are produced annually in India by solar evaporation. Crude sodium chloride, generally obtained by crystallisation of brine solution, contains sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, CaCl\({}_{2}\), and magnesium chloride, MgCl\({}_{2}\) are impurities because they are deliquescent (absorb moisture easily from the atmosphere). To obtain pure sodium chloride, the crude salt is dissolved in minimum amount of water and filtered to remove insoluble impurities. The solution is then saturated with hydrogen chloride gas. Crystals of pure sodium chloride separate out. Calcium and magnesium chloride, being more soluble than sodium chloride, remain in solution.

Sodium chloride melts at 1081K. It has a solubility of 36.0 g in 100 g of water at 273 K. The solubility does not increase appreciably with increase in temperature.

_Uses :_

* It is used as a common salt or table salt for domestic purpose.
* It is used for the preparation of Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), NaOH and Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\).

_Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda)_, NaOH

Sodium hydroxide is generally prepared commercially by the electrolysis of sodium chloride in Castner-Kellner cell. A brine solution is electrolysed using a mercury cathode and a carbon anode. Sodium metal discharged at the cathode combines with mercury to form sodium amalgam. Chlorine gas is evolved at the anode.

\({}^{\cdot}\)Cathode : Na\({}^{+}\) + e\({}^{-}\)\({}^{\frac{\rm{Hg}}{\rm{Na}}}\) - amalgam

\({}^{\cdot}\)Anode : Cl\({}^{-}\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}+\)e\({}^{-}\)

The amalgam is treated with water to give sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.

2Na-amalgam + 2H\({}_{2}\)O\(\cdot\)2NaOH+ 2Hg +H\({}_{2}\)

Sodium hydroxide is a white, translucent solid. It melts at 591 K. It is readily soluble in water to give a strong alkaline solution. Cry stals of sodium hydroxide are deliquescent. The sodium hydroxide solution at the surface reacts with the CO\({}_{2}\) in the atmosphere to form Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\).

_Uses:_ It is used in (i) the manufacture of soap, paper, artificial silk and a number of chemicals, (ii) in petroleum refining, (iii) in the purification of bauxite, (iv) in the textile industries for mercerising cotton fabrics, (v) for the preparation of pure fats and oils, and (vi) as a laboratory reagent.

_sodium Hydrogencarbonate (Baking Soda)_, NaHCO\({}_{3}\)

**Sodium hydrogencarbonate is known as baking soda because it decomposes on heating to generate bubbles of carbon dioxide (leaving holes in cakes or parties and making them light and fluffy).**

**Sodium hydrogencarbonate is made by saturating a solution of sodium carbonate with carbon dioxide. The white crystalline powder of sodium hydrogencarbonate, being less soluble, gets separated out.**

**Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + CO\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) 2 NaHCO\({}_{3}\)**

**Sodium hydrogencarbonate is a mild antiseptic for skin infections. It is used in fire extinguishers.**

**10.5 BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM**

**A typical 70 kg man contains about 90 g of Na and 170 g of K compared with only 5 g of iron and 0.06 g of copper.**

**Sodium ions are found primarily on the outside of cells, being located in blood plasma and in the interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells. These ions participate in the transmission of nerve signals in regulating the flow of water across cell membranes and in the transport of sugars and amino adds into cells. Sodium and potassium, although so similar chemically, differ quantitatively in their ability to penetrate cell membranes, in their transport mechanisms and in their efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus, potassium ions are the most abundant cations within cell fluids, where they activate many enzymes, participate in the oxidation of glucose to produce ATP and, with sodium, are responsible for the transmission of nerve signals.**

**Thereis a very considerable variation in the concentration of sodium and potassium ions found on the opposite sides of cell membranes. As a typical example, in blood plasma, sodium is present to the extent of 143 mmol\({}^{-1}\), whereas the potassium level is only 5 mmol\({}^{-1}\) within the red blood cells. These concentrations change to 10 mmol\({}^{-1}\)(Na\({}^{+}\)) and 105 mmol\({}^{-1}\)(K\({}^{+}\)). These ionic gradients demonstrate that a discriminatory mechanism, called the sodium-potassium pump, operates across the cell membranes which consumes more than one-third of the ATP used by a resting animal and about 15 kg per 24 h in a resting human.**

**10.6 GROUP 2 ELEMENTS : ALKALINE EARTH METALS**

**The group 2 elements comprise beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. They follow alkali metals in the periodic table. These (except beryllium) are known as alkaline earth metals. The first element beryllium differs from the rest of the members and shows diagonal relationship to aluminium. Theatomic and physical properties of the alkaline earth metals are shown in Table 10.2.**

**10.6.1 Electronic Configuration**

**These elements have two electrons in the \(s\)-orbital of thevalence shell (Table 10.2). Their general electronic configuration may be represented as [noble gas] \(ns^{2}\). Like alkali metals, the compounds of these elements are also predominantly ionic.**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Element** & **Symbol** & **Electronic** \\  & & **configuration** \\ \hline Beryllium & Be & 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\) \\ Magnesium & Mg & 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2\(p\)\({}^{3}\)S\({}^{2}\) \\ Calcium & Ca & 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2\(p\)\({}^{3}\)S\({}^{2}\)3\(p\)\({}^{6}\)4\(s\)\({}^{2}\) \\ Strontium & Sr & 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2\(p\)\({}^{3}\)S\({}^{3}\)3\(p\)\({}^{6}\)3\(d\)\({}^{10}\) \\  & & 4 s\({}^{4}\)4\(p\)\({}^{5}\)S\({}^{2}\) \\ Barium & Ba & 1 s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2\(p\)\({}^{3}\)S\({}^{2}\)3\(p\)\({}^{6}\)3\(d\)\({}^{10}\)4\(s\)\({}^{2}\) \\  & & 4\(p\)\({}^{6}\)4\(d\)\({}^{10}\)5s\({}^{2}\)5\(p\)\({}^{6}\)6\(s\)\({}^{2}\) or \\  & & [Xel6s\({}^{2}\) \\ Radium & Ra & [Rn]7s\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**10.6.2 Atomic and Ionic Radii**

**The atomic and ionic radii of the alkaline earth metals are smaller than those of the corresponding alkali metals in the same periods. This is due to the increased nuclear charge in these elements. Within the group, the atomic and ionic radii increase with increase in atomic number.

### Ionization Enthalpies

The alkaline earth metals have low ionization enthalpies due to fairly large size of the atoms. Since the atomic size increases down the group, their ionization enthalpy decreases (Table 10.2). The first ionisation enthalpies of the alkaline earth metals are higher than those of the corresponding Group 1 metals. This is due to their small size as compared to the corresponding alkali metals. It is interesting to note that the second ionisation enthalpies of the alkaline earth metals are smaller than those of the corresponding alkali metals.

### Hydration Enthalpies

Like alkali metal ions, the hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions decrease with increase in ionic size down the group.

Be\({}^{2+}\)\(>\) Mg\({}^{2+}\)\(>\) Ca\({}^{2+}\)\(>\) Sr\({}^{2+}\)\(>\) Ba\({}^{2+}\)

The hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions are larger than those of alkali metal ions. Thus, compounds of alkaline earth metals are more extensively hydrated than those of alkali metals, e.g., MgCl\({}_{2}\) and CaCl\({}_{2}\) exist as MgCl\({}_{2}\).6H\({}_{2}\)O and CaCl\({}_{2}\).6H\({}_{2}\)O while NaCl and KCl do not form such hydrates.

### Physical Properties

The alkaline earth metals, in general, are silvery white, lustrous and relatively soft but harder than the alkali metals. Bersyllium and magnesium appear to be somewhat greyish. The melting and boiling points of these metals arehigher than the corresponding alkali metals due to smaller sizes. The trend is, however, not systematic. Because of the low ionisation enthalpies, they are strongly electropositive in nature. The electropositive character increases down the group from Be to Ba. Calcium,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:281]

### General Characteristics of Compounds of the Alkaline Earth Metals

The dipositive oxidation state (M\({}^{2}\)*) is the predominant valence of Group 2 elements. The alkaline earth metals form compounds which are predominantly ionic but less ionic than the corresponding compounds of alkali metals. This is due to increased nuclear charge and smaller size. The oxides and other compounds of beryllium and magnesium are more covalent than those formed by the heavier and large sized members (Ca, Sr, Ba). The general characteristics of some of the compounds of alkali earth metals are described below.

_(i) Oxides and Hydroxides:_ The alkaline earth metals burn in oxygen to form the monoxide, MO which, except for BeO, have rock-salt structure. The BeO is essentially covalent in nature. The enthalpies of formation of these oxides are quite high and consequently they are very stable to heat. BeO is amphoteric while oxides of other elements are ionic in nature. All these oxides except BeO are basic in nature and react with water to form sparingly soluble hydroxides.

MO + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\) M(OH)\({}_{2}\)

The solubility, thermal stability and the basic character of these hydroxides increase with increasing atomic number from Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) to Ba(OH)\({}_{2}\). The alkaline earth metal hydroxides are, however, less basic and less stable than alkali metal hydroxides. Beryllium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature as it reacts with acid and alkali both.

Be(OH)\({}_{2}\) + 2OH \(\rightarrow\) [Be(OH)]\({}_{2}^{2-}\)

Be(OH)\({}_{2}\) + 2HCl + 2H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\) [Be(OH)]\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)

_(ii) Halides:_ Except for beryllium halides, all other halides of alkaline earth metals are ionic in nature. Beryllium halides are essentially covalent and soluble in organic solvents. Beryllium chloride has a chain structure in the solid state as shown below:

In the vapour phase BeCl\({}_{2}\) tends to form a chloro-bridged dimer which dissociates into the linear monomer at high temperatures of the order of 1200 K. The tendency to form halide hydrates gradually decreases (for example, MgCl\({}_{2}\cdot\)8H\({}_{2}\)O, CaCl\({}_{2}\cdot\)6H\({}_{2}\)O, SrCl\({}_{2}\cdot\)6H\({}_{2}\)O and BaCl\({}_{2}\cdot\)2H\({}_{2}\)O) down the group. The dehydration of hydrated chlorides, bromides and iodides of Ca, Sr and Ba can be achieved on heating; however, the corresponding hydrated halides of Be and Mg on heating suffer hydrolysis. The fluorides are relatively less soluble than the chlorides owing to their high lattice energies.

_(iii) Salts of Ovaocids:_ The alkaline earth metals also form salts of oxoacids. Some of these are :

_Carbonates:_ Carbonates of alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water and can be precipitated by addition of a sodium or ammonium carbonate solution to a solution of a soluble salt of these metals. The solubility of carbonates in water decreases as the atomic number of the metal ion increases. All the carbonates decompose on heating to give carbon dioxide and the oxide. Beryllium carbonate is unstable and can be kept only in the atmosphere of CO\({}_{2}\). The thermal stability increases with increasing cationic size.

_Sulphates:_ The sulphates of the alkaline earth metals are all white solids and stable to heat. BeSO\({}_{4}\), and MgSO\({}_{4}\) are readily soluble in water; the solubility decreases from CaSO\({}_{4}\) to BaSO\({}_{4}\). The greater hydration enthalpies of Be\({}^{2+}\) and Mg\({}^{2+}\) ions overcome the lattice enthalpy factor and therefore their sulphates are soluble in water.

_Nitrates:_ The nitrates are made by dissolution of the carbonates in dilute nitric acid. Magnesium nitrate crystallises with six molecules of water, whereas barium nitrate crystallises as the anhydrous salt. This again shows a decreasing tendency to form hydrates with increasing size and decreasing hydration enthalpy. All of them decompose on heating to give the oxide like lithium nitrate.

2M (NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2MO + 4NO\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\)

(M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba)

**Problem 10.4**: Why does the solubility of alkaline earth metal by droxad des in water increase down the group?
**Solution**: Among alkaline earth metal hydroxides, the anion being common the cationic radius will influence the lattice enthalpy. Since lattice enthalpy decreases much more than the hydration enthalpy with increasing ionic size, the solubility increases as we go down the group.
**Problem 10.5**: Why does the solubility of alkaline earth metal carbonates and sulphates in water decrease down the group?
**Solution**: The size of anions being much larger compared to cations, the lattice enthalpy will remain almost constant within a particular group. Since the hydration enthalpies decrease down the group, solubility will decrease as found for alkaline earth metal carbonates and sulphates.

### Anomalous BEHAVOUR OF BERYLLIUM

Beryllium, the first member of the Group 2 metals, shows anomalous behaviour as compared to magnesium and rest of the members. Further, it shows diagonal relationship to aluminium which is discussed subsequently.

* Beryllium has exceptionally small atomic andionic sizes and thus does not compare well with other members of the group. Because of high ionisation enthalpy and small size it forms compounds which are largely covalent and get easily by droysed.
* Beryllium does not exhibit coordination number more than four as in its valence shell there are only four orbitals. The remaining members of the group can have a coordination number of six by making use of \(d\)-orbitals.
* The oxide and hydroxide of beryllium, unlike the hydroxides of other elements in the group, are amphoteric in nature.

### Diagonal Relationship between Beryllium and Aluminium

The ionic radius of Be\({}^{2+}\) is estimated to be 31 pm: the charge/radius ratio is nearly the same as that of the Al\({}^{3+}\) ion. Hence beryllium resembles aluminium in some ways. Some of the similarities are:

* Like aluminium, beryllium is not readily attacked by acids because of the presence of an oxide film on the surface of the metal.
* Beryllium by droxide dissolves in excess of alkali to give a beryllate ion, [Be(OH)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) just as aluminium hydroxide gives aluminate ion, [Al(OH)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{7}\).
* The chlorides of both beryllium and aluminium have Cl\({}^{7}\) bridged chloride structure in vapour phase. Both the chlorides are soluble in organic solvents and are strong Lewis acids. They are used as Friedel Craft catalysts.
* Beryllium and aluminium ions have strong tendency to form complexes, BeF\({}_{4}^{2-}\), AFF\({}_{6}^{3-}\).

### SOME IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS OF CALCIUM

Important compounds of calcium are calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium sulphate, calcium carbonate and cement. These are industrially important compounds. The large scale preparation of these compounds and their uses are described below.

_Calcium Oxide or Quick Lime_, CaO

It is prepared on a commercial scale by heating limestone (CaCO\({}_{3}\)) in a rotary kiln at 1070-1270 K.

The carbon dioxide is removed as soon as itis produced to enable the reaction to proceed to completion.

Calcium oxide is a white amorphous solid. It has a melting point of 2870 K. On exposure to atmosphere, it absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide.

\(\mathrm{CaO+H_{2}O\toCa\left(OH\right)_{2}}\)

\(\mathrm{CaO+CO_{2}\toCaCO_{3}}\)

The addition of limited amount of water breaks the lump of lime. This process is called _slaking of lime_. Quick lime slacked with soda gives solid sodalime. Being a basic oxide, it combines with acidicoxides at high temperature.

\(\mathrm{CaO+SiO_{2}\toCaSiO_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{6CaO+P_{4}O_{10}\to 2Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}}\)

_Uses:_

1. It is an important primary material for manufacturing cement and is the cheapest form of alkali.
2. It is used in the manufacture of sodium carbonate from caustic soda.
3. It is employed in the purification of sugar and in the manufacture of dye stuffs.

Calcium Hydroxide (Slaked lime), \(\mathrm{Ca(OH)_{2}}\)

Calcium hydroxide is prepared by adding water to quick lime, CaO.

It is a white amorphous powder. It is sparingly soluble in water. The aqueous solution is known as _lime water_ and a suspension of slaked lime in water is known as _milk of lime_.

When carbon dioxide is passed through lime water it turns milky due to the formation of calcium carbonate.

\(\mathrm{Ca\left(OH\right)_{2}+CO_{2}\toCaCO_{3}+H_{2}O}\)

On passing excess of carbon dioxide, the precipitate dissolves to form calcium hydrogencarbonate.

\(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}+CO_{2}+H_{2}O\toCa\left(HCO_{3}\right)_{2}}\)

Milk of lime reacts with chlorine to form pyochlorite, a constituent of bleaching powder.

\(\mathrm{2Ca\left(OH\right)_{2}+2Cl_{2}\toCaCl_{2}+Ca\left(OCl\right)_{2}+2H_{2}O}\)

_Uses:_

1. It is used in the preparation of mortar, a building material.
2. It is used in white wash due to its disinfectant nature.
3. It is used in glass making, in tanning industry, for the preparation of bleaching powder and for purification of sugar.

Calcium Carbonate, \(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}\)

Calcium carbonate occurs in nature in several forms like limestone, chalk, marble etc. It can be prepared by passing carbon dioxide through slaked lime or by the addition of sodium carbonate to calcium chloride.

\(\mathrm{Ca\left(OH\right)_{2}+CO_{2}\toCaCO_{3}+H_{2}O}\)

\(\mathrm{CaCl_{2}+Na_{2}CO_{3}\toCaCO_{3}+2NaCl}\)

Excess of carbon dioxide should be avoided since this leads to the formation of water soluble calcium by drogencarbonate.

Calcium carbonate is a white fluffy powder. It is almost insoluble in water. When heated to 1200 K, it decomposes to evolve carbon dioxide.

\(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}-1200K\toCaO+CO_{2}}\)

It reacts with dilute acid to liberate carbon dioxide.

\(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}+2HCl\toCaCl_{2}+H_{2}O+CO_{2}}\)

\(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}+H_{2}SO_{4}\toCaSO_{4}+H_{2}O+CO_{2}}\)

_Uses:_

It is used as a building material in the form of marble and in the manufacture of quick lime. Calcium carbonate along with magnesium carbonate is used as a flux in the extraction of metals such as iron. Specially precipitated \(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}\) is extensively used in the manufacture of high quality paper. It is also used as an antacid, mild abrasive in tooth paste, a constituent of chewing gum, and a filler in cosmetics.

Calcium sulphate (Plaster of Paris), \(\mathrm{CaSO_{4}.^{1/2}H_{2}O}\)

It is a hemihydrate of calcium sulphate. It is obtained when gypsum, \(\mathrm{CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O}\), is heated to 393 K.

\(\mathrm{2\left(CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O\right)\to 2\left(CaSO_{4}\right).H_{2}O+3H_{2}O}\)

Above 393 K. no water of crystallisation is left and anhydrous calcium sulphate, \(\mathrm{CaSO_{4}}\) is formed. This is known as 'dead burnt plaster'.

It has a remarkable property of setting with water. On mixing with an adequate quantity of water it forms a plastic mass that gets into a hard solid in 5 to 15 minutes.

_Uses:_

The largest use of Plaster of Paris is in the building industry as well as plasters. It is used for immobilising the affected part of organ where there is a bone fracture or sprain. It is also employed in dentistry, in ornamental work and for making casts of statues and busts.

_Cement:_ Cement is an important building material. It was first introduced in England in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin. It is also called Portland cement because it resembles with the natural limestone quarried in the Isle of Portland, England.

Cement is a product obtained by combining a material rich in lime, CaO with other material such as clay which contains silica, SiO2 along with the oxides of aluminium, iron and magnesium. The average composition of Portland cement is: CaO, 50-60%; SiO2, 20-25%; Al_O3, 5-10%; MgO, 2-3%; Fe_O3, 1-2% and SO3, 1-2%. For a good quality cement, the ratio of silica (SiO2) to alumina (Al_O3) should be between 2.5 and 4 and the ratio of lime (CaO) to the total of the oxides of silicon (SiO_) aluminium (Al_O3) and iron (Fe_O3) should be as close as possible to 2.

The raw materials for the manufacture of cement are limestone and clay. When clay and lime are strongly heated together they fuse and react to form 'cement linker'. This clinker is mixed with 2-3% by weight of gypsum (CaSO4.2H_O) to form cement. Thus important ingredients present in Portland cement are dicalcium silicate (Ca_SiO4) 26%, tricalcium silicate (Ca_SiO5) 51% and tricalcium aluminate (Ca_SiO4) 11%.

_Setting of Cement:_ When mixed with water, the setting of cement takes place to give a hard mass. This is due to the hydration of the molecules of the constituents and their rearrangement. The purpose of adding gypsum is only to slow down the process of setting of the cement so that it gets sufficiently hardened.

_Uses:_ Cement has become a commodity of national necessity for any country next to iron and steel. It is used in concrete and reinforced concrete, in plastering and in the construction of bridges, dams and buildings.

### Biological Importance of Magnesium and Calcium

An adult body contains about 25 g of Mg and 1200 g of Ca compared with only 5 g of iron and 0.06 g of copper. The daily requirement in the human body has been estimated to be 200 - 300 mg.

All enzymes that utilise ATP in phosphate transfer require magnesium as the cofactor. The main pigment for the absorption of light in plants is chlorophyll which contains magnesium. About 99 % of body calcium is present in bones and teeth. It also plays important roles in neuromuscular function, interneuronal transmission, cell membrane integrity and blood coagulation. The calcium concentration in plasma is regulated at about 100 mgL-1. It is maintained by two hormones: calcium and parathyroid hormone. Do you know that boneis not an inert and unchanging substance butis continuously being solubilised and redeposited to the extent of 400 mg per day in man? All this calcium passes through the plasma.

## Summary

The **s-Block** of the periodic table constitutes **Group1** (alkali metals) and **Group 2** (alkaline earth metals). They are so called because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature. The alkali metals are characterised by one **s-**electron and the alkaline earth metals by two **s-**electrons in the valence shell of their atoms. These are highly reactive metals forming monopositive (M) and dipositve (M^2*) ions respectively.

There is a regular trend in the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metal with increasing atomic numbers. The **atomic** and **ionic** sizes increase and the **ionization enthalpies** decrease systematically down the group. Somewhat similar trends are observed among the properties of the alkaline earth metals.

The first element in each of these groups, lithium in Group 1 and beryllium in Group 2 shows similarities in properties to the second member of the next group. Such similarities are termed as the **'diagonal relationship'** in the periodic table. As such these elements are anomalous as far as their group characteristics are concerned.

The alkali metals are silvery white, soft and low melting. They are highly reactive. The compounds of alkali metals are predominantly ionic. Their oxides and hydroxdes are soluble in water forming strong alkalies. Important compounds of sodium includes sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogencarbonate. Sodium hydroxide is manufactured by **Castner-Kellner** process and sodium carbonate by **Solvay** process.

The chemistry of alkaline earth metals is very much like that of the alkali metals. However, some differences arise because of reduced atomic and ionic sizes and increased cationic charges in case of alkaline earth metals. Their oxides and hydroxdes are less basic than the alkali metal oxides and hydroxdes. Industrially important compounds of calcium include calcium oxide (line), calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), calcium sulphate **(Plaster of Paris)**, calcium carbonate (limestone) and cement. **Portland cement** is an important constructional material. It is manufactured by heating a pulverised mixture of limestone and clay in a rotary kiln. The clinker thus obtained is mixed with some gypsum (2-3%) to give a fine powder of cement. All these substances find variety of uses in different areas.

Monovalent sodium and potassium ions and divalent magnesium and calcium ions are found in large proportions in **biological fluids**. These ions perform important **biological functions** such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction.

The relative stabilities of these two oxidation states - group oxidation state and two unit less than the group oxidation state - may vary from group to group and will be discussed at appropriate places.

It is interesting to note that the _non-metals_ and _metalloids_ exist only in the \(p\)-block of the periodic table. The non-metallic character of elements decreases down the group. In fact the heaviest element in each \(p\)-block group is the most metallic in nature. This change from non-metallic to metallic character brings diversity in the chemistry of these element s depending on the group to which they belong.

In general, non-metals have higherionisation enthalpies and higher electronegativities than the metals. Hence, in contrast to metals which readily form cations, non-metals readily form anions. The compounds formed by highly reactive non-metals with highly reactive metals are generally ionic because of large differences in their electronegativities. On the other hand, compounds formed between non-metals themselves are largely covalent in character because of small differences in their electronegativities. The change of non-metallic to metallic character can be best illustrated by the nature of oxides they form. The non-metal oxides are acidic or neutral whereas metal oxides are basic in nature.

_The first member of \(p\)-block differs from the remaining members of their corresponding group in two major respects. First is the size and all other properties which depend on size. Thus, the lightest \(p\)-block elements show the same kind of differences as the lightest s-block elements, lithium and beryllium. The second important difference, which applies only to the \(p\)-block elements, arises from the effect of \(d\)-orbitals in the valence shell of heavier elements (starting from the third period onwards) and their lack in second period elements. The second period elements of \(p\)-groups starting from boron are restricted to a maximum covalence of four (using 2s and three 2\(p\) orbitals). In contrast, the third period elements of \(p\)-groups with the electronic configuration \(3s^{2}3p^{n}\) have the vacant \(3d\) orbitals lying between the \(3p\) and the \(4s\) levels of energy. Using these \(d\)-orbitals the third period elements can expand their covalence above four. For example, while boron forms only [BF\({}_{d}\)]-, aluminium gives [AlF\({}_{d}\)]-ion. The presence of these \(d\)-orbitals influences the chemistry of the heavier elements in a number of other ways. The combined effect of size and availability of \(d\) orbitals considerably influences the ability of these elements to form \(\pi\) bonds. The first member of a group differs from the heavier members in it's ability to form \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) multiple bonds to itself (e.g., C=C, C=C,N=N) and to other second row elements (e.g., C=O, C=N, C=N, N=O). This type of \(\pi\) - bonding is not particularly strong for the heavier \(p\)-block elements. The heavier elements do form \(\pi\) bonds but this involves \(d\) orbitals (\(d\pi\) - \(p\pi\) or \(d\pi\) - \(d\pi\)). As the \(d\) orbitals are of higher energy than the \(p\) orbitals, they contribute less to the overall stability of molecules than does p\(\pi\)- p\(\pi\) bonding of the second row elements. However, the coordination number in species of heavier elements may be higher than for the first element in the same oxidation state. For example, in +5 oxidation state both N and P form oxoanions : NO\({}_{3}^{-}\) (three-coordination with \(\pi\) - bond involving one nitrogen \(p\)-orbital) and PO\({}_{4}^{3-}\) (four- coordination involving s, \(p\) and \(d\) orbitals contributing to the \(\pi\) - bond). In this unit we will study the chemistry of group 13 and 14 elements of the periodic table.

### Group 13 elements: the boron family

This group elements show a wide variation in properties. Boron is a typical non-metal, aluminium is a metal but shows many chemical similarities to boron, and gallium, indium and thallium are almost exclusively metallic in character.

Boron is a fairly rare element, mainly occurs as orthobaric acid, (H\({}_{3}\)BO\({}_{3}\)), borax, Na\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{7}\)-10H\({}_{2}\)O, and kernite, Na\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{7}\)-4H\({}_{2}\)O. In India borax occurs in Puga Valley (Ladakh) and Samkhar Lake (Rajasthan). The abundance of boron in earth crust is less than 0.0001% by mass. There are two isotopic forms of boron \({}^{10}\)B (19%) and \({}^{11}\)B (81%). Aluminum is the most abundant metal and the third most abundant element in the earth's crust (8.3% by mass) after oxy gen (45.5%) and Si (27.7%). Bauxite, Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). 2H\({}_{2}\)O and cryolite, Na\({}_{3}\)AlF\({}_{6}\) are the important minerals of aluminium. In India it is found as mica in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa and Jammu. Gallium, indium and thallium are less abundant elements in nature.

The atomic, physical and chemical properties of these elements are discussed below.

#### 11.1.1 Electronic Configuration

The outer electronic configuration of these elements is \(ns^{2}np^{1}\). A close look at the electronic configuration suggests that while boron and aluminium have noble gas core, gallium and indium have noble gas plus 10 \(d\)-electrons, and thallium has noble gas plus 14\(f\)- electrons plus 10 \(d\)-electrons cores. Thus, the electronic structures of these elements are more complex than for the first two groups of elements discussed in unit 10. This difference in electronic structures affects the other properties and consequently the chemistry of all the elements of this group.

#### 11.1.2 Atomic Radii

On moving down the group, for each successive member one extra shell of electrons is added and, therefore, atomic radius is expected to increase. However, a deviation can be seen. Atomic radius of Ga is less than that of Al. This can be understood from the variation in the inner core of the electronic configuration. The presence of additional 10 \(d\)-electrons offer only poor screening effect (Unit 2) for the outer electrons from the increased nuclear charge in gallium. Consequently, the atomic radius of gallium (135 pm) is less than that of aluminium (143 pm).

#### 11.1.3 Ionization Enthalpy

The ionisation enthalpy values as expected from the general trends do not decrease smoothly down the group. The decrease from B to Al is associated with increase in size. The observed discontinuity in the ionisation enthalpy values between Al and Ga, and between In and are due to inability of \(d\)- and \(f\)-electrons,which have low screening effect, to compensate the increase in nuclear charge.

The order of ionisation enthalpies, as expected, is \(\Delta\)H\({}_{1}\)<\(\Delta\)H\({}_{2}\)<\(\Delta\)\({}_{i}\)H\({}_{3}\). The sum of the first three ionisation enthalpies for each of the elements is very high. Effect of this will be apparent when you study their chemical properties.

#### 11.1.4 Electronegativity

Down the group, electronegativity first decreases from B to Al and then increasesmarginally (Table 11.2). This is because of the discrepancies in atomic size of the elements.

#### Physical Properties

Boron is non-metallic in nature. It is extremely hard and black coloured solid. It exists in many allotropic forms. Due to very strong crystalline lattice, boron has unusually high melting point. Rest of the members are soft metals with low melting point and high electrical conductivity. It is worthwhile to note that gallium with unusually low melting point (303K), could exist in liquid state during summer. Its high boiling point (2676K) makes it a useful material for measuring high temperatures. Density of the elements increases down the group from boron to thallium.

#### Chemical Properties

_Oxidation state and trends in chemical reactivity_

**Due to small size of boron, the sum of its first three ionization enthalpies is very high. This prevents it to form + 3 ions and forces it to form only covalent compounds. But as we move from B to Al, the sum of the first three ionisation enthalpies of Al considerably decreases, and is therefore able to form Al\({}^{3+}\) ions. In fact, aluminium is a highly electropositive metal. However, down the group, due to poor shielding effect of intervening \(d\) and \(f\) orbitals, the increased effective nuclear charge holds ns electrons tightly (responsible for _inter pair effect_) and thereby, restricting their participation in bonding. As a result of this, only \(p\)-orbital electron may be involved in bonding. In fact in Ga, In and Tl, both + 1 and +3 oxidation states are observed. The relative stability of +1 oxidation state progressively increases for heavier elements: Al\(<\)Ga\(<\)In\(<\)Tl. In thallium +1 oxidation state is predominant whereas the +3 oxidation state is highly oxidising in character. The compounds in +1 oxidation state, as expected from energy considerations, are more ionic than those in +3 oxidation state.**

In trivalent state, the number of electrons around the central atom in a molecule of the compounds of these elements (e. g., boron in BF3) will be only six. Such **electron deficient** molecules have tendency to accept a pair of electrons to achieve stable electronic configuration and thus, behave as Lewis acids. The tendency to behave as Lewis acid decreases with the increase in the size down the group. BCl3 easily accepts a lone pair of electrons from ammonia to form BCl3NH3.

In trivalent state most of the compounds being covalent are hydrolysed in water. For example, the trichlorides on hyrolysis in water form tetrahedral \(\left[\text{M}\left(\text{OH}\right)_{4}\right]\) species; the hybridisation state of element M is \(sp^{3}\). Aluminium chloride in acidified aqueous solution forms octahedral \(\left[\text{Al}\left(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right)_{6}\right]^{3}\) ion. In this complex ion, the 3\(d\) orbitals of Al are involved and the hybridisation state of Al is \(sp^{3}d^{2}\).

**Problem 11.1**

Standard electrode potential values, E\({}^{\circ}\) for Al\({}^{3+}\)/Al is -1.66 V and that of Tl\({}^{3+}\)/Tl is +1.26 V. Predict about the formation of M\({}^{3+}\) ion in solution and compare the electropositive character of the two metals.

**Solution**

Standard electrode potential values for two half cell reactions suggest that aluminium has high tendency to make Al\({}^{3+}\)(aq) ions, whereas Tl\({}^{3+}\) is not only unstable in solution but is a powerful oxidising agent also. Thus Tl\({}^{3+}\) is more stable in solution than Tl\({}^{3+}\). Aluminium being able to form +3 ions easily, is more electropositive than thallium.

_(i) Reactivity towards air_

Boron is unreactive in crystalline form. Aluminium forms a very thin oxide layer on the surface which protects the metal from further attack. Amorphous boron and aluminium metal on heating in air form B2O3 and Al2O3 respectively. With dinitrogen at high temperature they form nitrides.

\[2\text{E}\left(\text{s}\right)+3\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\text{---} \lambda\text{---}2\text{E}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\left(\text{s}\right)\] \[2\text{E}\left(\text{s}\right)+\text{N}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right) \text{---}\lambda\text{---}2\text{EN}\left(\text{s}\right)\] \[\text{(E = element)}\]

The nature of these oxides varies down the group. Boron trioxide is acidic and reacts with basic (metallic) oxides forming metal borates. Aluminium and gallium oxides are amphoteric and those of indium and thallium are basic in their properties.

_(ii) Reactivity towards acids and alkalies_

Boron does not react with acids and alkalies even at moderate temperature; but aluminium dissolves in mineral acids and aqueous alkalies and thus shows amphoteric character.

Aluminium dissolves in dilute HCl and liberates dihydrogen.

2Al(s) + 6HC1(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2Al\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + 6Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq)

+ 3H2(g)

However, concentrated nitric acid renders aluminium passive by forming a protective oxide layer on the surface.

Aluminium also reacts with aqueous alkali and liberates dihydrogen.

\[2\text{Al}\left(\text{s}\right)+2\text{NaO}\left(\text{aq}\right)+6\text{H}_{2 }\text{O}\left(\text{l}\right)\] \[\text{\(2\,Na}^{+}\left[\text{Al}\left(\text{OH}\right)_{4}\right] ^{-}\left[\text{aq}\right] + 3\text{H}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\] Sodium tetrahy droxoaluminate[III]

_(iii) Reactivity towards halogens_

These elements react with halogens to form trihalides (except Tl Tl3).

2E(s) + 3 X2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2EX3(s) (X = F, Cl, Br, I)

**Problem 11.2**

White fumes appear around the bottle of anhydrous aluminium chloride. Give reason.

**Solution**

An hydrous aluminium chloride is partially hydrolys with atmospheric moisture to liberate HCl gas. Moist HCl appears whitein colour.

### IMPORTANT TRENDS AND ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OF BORON

Certain important trends can be observed in the chemical behaviour of group 13 elements. The tri-chlorides, bromides and iodides of all these elements being covalent in nature are hydrolys in water. Species like tetrahedral [M(OH)]\({}^{-}\) and octahedral [M(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), except in boron, exist in aqueous medium.

The monomeric trihalides, being electron deficient, are strong Lewis acids. Boron trifluoride easily reacts with Lewis bases such as NH\({}_{3}\) to complete octet around boron.

\[\text{F}_{3}\text{B}\ \ +:\text{NH}_{3}\ \ \rightarrow\ \text{F}_{3}\text{B}\gets \text{NH}_{3}\]

It is due to the absence of \(d\) orbitals that the maximum covalence of B is 4. Since the \(d\) orbitals are available with Al and other elements, the maximum covalence can be expected beyond 4. Most of the other metal halides (_e.g._, AlCl\({}_{3}\)) are dimerised through halogen bridging (_e.g._, Al\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{6}\)). The metal species completes its octet by accepting electrons from halogen in these halogen bridged molecules.

**Problem 11.3**

Boron is unable to form BF\({}_{6}\)\({}^{3-}\) ion. Explain.

**Solution**

Due to non-availability of \(d\) orbitals, boron is unable to expand its octet. Therefore, the maximum covalence of boron cannot exceed 4.

### SOME IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS OF BORON

Some useful compounds of boron are borax. orthoboric acid and diborane. We will briefly study their chemistry.

### Borax

It is the most important compound of boron. It is a white crystalline solid of formula Na\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{7}\) 10H\({}_{2}\)O. In fact it contains the tetranuclear units \(\left[\text{B}_{4}\text{O}_{5}\left(\text{OH}\right)_{4}\right]^{2-}\) and correct formula: therefore, is Na\({}_{2}\)[B\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{5}\left(\text{OH}\right)_{4}\)].8H\({}_{2}\)O. Borax dissolves in water to give an alkaline solution.

\[\text{Na}_{2}\text{B}_{4}\text{O}_{7}+7\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\to 2\text{ NaOH}+\ 4\text{H}_{3}\text{BO}_{3}\]

Orthboric acid

On heating, borax first loses water molecules and swells up. On further heating it turns into a transparent liquid, which solidifies into glass like material known as borax bead.

The metaborates of many transition metals have characteristic colours and, therefore, borax bead test can be used to identify them in the laboratory. For example, when borax is heated in a Bunsen burner flame with CoO on a loop of platinum wire, a blue coloured Co(BO\({}_{2}\))\({}_{2}\) bead is formed.

### Orthboric acid

Orthboric acid, H\({}_{3}\)BO\({}_{3}\) is a white crystalline solid, with soapy touch. It is sparingly soluble in water but highly soluble in hot water. It can be prepared by acidifying an aqueous solution of borax.

\[\text{Na}_{2}\text{B}_{4}\text{O}_{7}+2\text{HCl}+5\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\to 2 \text{NaCl}+4\text{B}\left(\text{OH}\right)_{3}\]

It is also formed by the hydrolysis (reaction with water or dilute acid) of most boron compounds (halides, hydrides, etc.). It has a layer structure in which planar BO\({}_{3}\) units arejoined by hydrogen bonds as shown in Fig. 11.1.

Boric acid is a weak monobasic acid. It is not a protonic acid but acts as a Lewis acid by accepting electrons from a hydroxyl ion:

\(\mathrm{B(OH)_{3}+}\) 2HOH \(\rightarrow\) [B(OH)]\({}_{4}\)+ H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

On heating, orthoboric acid above 370K forms metabon c acid, \(\mathrm{HBO_{2}}\) which on further heating yields boric oxide, \(\mathrm{B_{2}O_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{H_{3}BO_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{HBO_{2}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{B_{2}O_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{2NaBH_{4}+I_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}+2NaI+H_{2}}\)

Diborane is produced on an industrial scale by the reaction of \(\mathrm{BF_{3}}\) with sodium hydride.

\(\mathrm{2BF_{3}+6NaH\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{450K}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}+6NaF}\)

Diborane is a colorless, highly toxic gas with a b.p. of 180 K. Diborane catches fire spontaneously upon exposure to air. It burns in oxygen releasing an enormous amount of energy.

\(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}+3O_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{B_{2}O_{3}+3H_{2}O}\);

\(\Delta_{c}H^{0}=-1976\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

Most of the higher boranes are also spontaneously flammable in air. Boranes are readily hydrolysed by water to give boric acid. \(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}(g)+6H_{2}O(l)\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{2B(OH)_{3}(aq)+6H_{2}(g)}\)

Diborane undergoes cleavage reactions with Lewis bases(L) to give borane adducts, \(\mathrm{BH_{3}L}\)

\(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}+2NMe_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{2BH_{3}NMe_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}+2CO\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{2BH_{3}CO}\)

Reaction of ammonia with diborane gives initially \(\mathrm{B_{2}H_{6}.2NH_{3}}\) which is formulated as [BH\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\)]\({}^{+}\) [BH\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{-}\) ; further heating gives borazine, \(\mathrm{B_{3}N_{3}H_{6}}\) known as "inorganic benzene" in view of its ring structure with alternate BH and NH groups.

\(\mathrm{3B_{2}H_{6}+6NH_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{3[BH_{2}(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+}[BH_{4}]^{-}}\)

\(\mathrm{Heat}\)\(\mathrm{2B_{3}N_{3}H_{6}+12H_{2}}\)

The structure of diborane is shown in Fig. 11.2(a). The four terminal hydrogen atoms and the two boron atoms lie in one plane. Above and below this plane, there are two bridging hydrogen atoms. The four terminal B-H bonds are regul ar two centre-two ederon bonds while the two bridge (B-H-B) bonds are different and can be described in terms of three

Figure 11: Structure of boric acid: the dotted lines represent hydrogen bonds

centre-two electron bonds shown in Fig. 11.2 (b).

Boron also forms a series of hydridoborates: the most important oneis the tetrahedral [BH4] ion. Tetrahydridoborates of several metals are known. Lithium and sodium tetrahydridoborates, also known as _borohydrides_. are prepared by the reaction of metal hydrides with B2H6 in diethyl ether.

Both LiBH4 and NaBH4 are used as reducing agents in organic synthesis. They are useful starting materials for preparing other metal borohydrides.

### USES OF BORON AND ALUMINIUM AND THEIR COMPOUNDS

Boron being extremely hard refractory solid of high melting point, low density and very low electrical conductivity. finds many applications. Boron fibres are used in making bullet-proof vest and light composite material for aircraft. The boron-10 (\({}^{10}\)B) isotope has high ability to absorb neutrons and, therefore, metal borides are used in nuclear industry as protective shields and control rods. The main industrial application of borax and boric acid is in the manufacture of heat resistant glasses (e.g., Pyrex), glass-wood and fibreglass. Borax is also used as a flux for soldering metals, for heat, scratch and stain resistant glazed coating to earthquakes and as constituent of medicinal soaps. An aqueous solution of orthobaric acid is generally used as a mild antiseptic.

Aluminium is a bright silvery-white metal, with high tensile strength It has a high electrical and thermal conductivity. On a weight-to-weight basis, the electrical conductivity of aluminium is twice that of copper. Aluminium is used extensively in industry and every day life. It forms alloys with Cu. Mn. Mg. Si and Zn. Aluminium and its alloys can be given shapes of pipe, tubes, rods, wires, plates or foils and, therefore, find uses in packing, utensil making. construction, aeroplane and transportation industry. The use of aluminium and its compounds for domestic purposes is now reduced considerably because of their toxic nature

### GROUP 14 ELEMENTS: THE CARBON FAMILY

Carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn) and lead (Pb) are the members of group 14. Carbon is the seventeenth most abundant element by mass in the earth's crust. It is widely distributed in nature in free as well as in the combined state. In elemental state it is available as coal, graphite and diamond; however, in combined state it is present as metal carbonates, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide gas (0.03%) in air. One can emphatically say that carbon is the most versatile element in the world. Its combination with other elements such as dihydrogen, dioxygen, chlorine and sulphur provides an astonishing array of materials ranging from living tissues to drugs and plastics. Organic chemistry is devoted to carbon containing compounds. It is an essential constituent of all living organisms. Naturally occurring carbon contains two stable isotopes:\({}^{12}\)C and \({}^{13}\)C. In addition to these, third isotope, \({}^{14}\)C is also present. It is radioactive isotope with half-life 5770 years and used for radiocarbon dating. Silicon is the second (27.7 % by mass) most abundant element on the earth's crust and is present in nature in the form of silica and silicates. Silicon is a very important component of ceramics, glass and cement.

Figure 11.2: Bonding in diborane. Each \(B\) atom uses \(\mathbf{sp}^{3}\) hybrids for bonding. Out of the four \(\mathbf{sp}^{3}\) hybrids on each \(B\) atom, one is without an electron shown in broken lines. The terminal \(B\)-\(H\) bonds are normal 2-centre-2-electron bonds but the two bridge bonds are 3-centre-2-electron bonds. The 3-centre-2-electron bridge bonds are also referred to as banana bonds.

Germanium exists only in traces. Tin occurs mainly as cassiterite, SnO\({}_{2}\) and lead as galena, PbS.

Ultrapure form of germanium and silicon are used to make transistors and semiconductor devices.

The important atomic and physical properties of the group 14 elements along with their electronic configuration are given in Table 1.2 Some of the atomic, physical and chemical properties are discussed below:

11.5.1 Electronic Configuration

The valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is \(ns^{2}np^{2}\). The inner core of the electronic configuration of elements in this group also differs.

11.5.2 Covalent Radius

There is a considerable increase in covalent radius from C to Si, thereafter from Si to Pb a small increase in radius is observed. This is due to the presence of completely filled \(d\) and \(f\) orbitals in heavier members.

11.5.3 Ionization Enthalpy

The first ionization enthalpy of group 14 members is higher than the corresponding members of group 13. The influence of inner core electrons is visible here also. In general the ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group. Small decrease in \(\Delta\)_H_ from Si to Ge to Sn and slight increase in \(\Delta\)_H_ from Sn to Pb is the consequence of poor shielding effect of intervening \(d\) and \(f\) orbitals and increase in size of the atom.

11.5.4 Electronegativity

Due to small size, the elements of this group are slightly more electronegative than group 13 elements. The electronegativity values for elements from Si to Pb are almost the same.

11.5.5 Physical Properties

All group 14 members are solids. Carbon and silicon arenon-metals, germanium is a metalloid,

#### 11.5.6 Chemical Properties

_Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity_

The group 14 elements have four electrons in outermost shell. The common oxidation states exhibited by these elements are +4 and +2. Carbon also exhibits negative oxidation states. Since the sum of the first four ionization enthalpies is very high, compounds in +4 oxidation state are generally covalent in nature. In heavier members the tendency to show +2 oxidation state increases in the sequence Ge<Sn<Pb. It is due to the inability of \(ns^{2}\) electrons of valence shell to participate in bonding. The relative stabilities of these two oxidation states vary down the group. Carbon and silicon mostly show +4 oxidation state. Germanium forms stable compounds in +4 state and only few compounds in +2 state. Tin forms compounds in both oxidation states (Sn in +2 state is a reducing agent). Lead compounds in +2 state are stable and in +4 state are strong oxidising agents. In tetravalent state the number of electrons around the central atom in a molecule (_e.g._, carbon in CCl\({}_{4}\)) is eight. Being _electron precise_ molecules, they are normally not expected to act as electron acceptor or electron donor species. Although carbon cannot exceed its covalence more than 4, other elements of the group can do so. It is because of the presence of \(d\) orbital in them. Due to this, their halides undergo hydrolysis and have tendency to form complexes by accepting electron pairs from donor species. For example, the species like, SiF\({}_{6}^{2}\)-, [GeCl\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2}\)-, [Sn(OH)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2}\)- exist where the hybridisation of the central atom is sp\({}^{3}\)\(d^{2}\).

_(i) Reactivity towards oxygen_

All members when heated in oxygen form oxides. There are mainly two types of oxides, _i.e._, monoxide and dioxide of formula MO and MO\({}_{2}\) respectively. SiO only exists at high temperature. Oxides in higher oxidation states of elements are generally more acidic than those in lower oxidation states. The dioxides -- CO\({}_{2}\), SiO\({}_{2}\) and GeO\({}_{2}\) are acidic, whereas SnO\({}_{2}\) and PbO\({}_{2}\) are amphoteric in nature. Among monoxides, CO is neutral, GeO is distinctly acidic whereas SnO and PbO are amphoteric.

**Problem 11.5**

**Select the member(s) of group 14 that (i) forms the most acidic dioxide, (ii) is commonly found in +2 oxidation state, (iii) used as semiconductor.**

**Solution**

**(i) carbon (ii) lead**

**(iii) silicon and germanium**

**(ii) Reactivity towards water**

**Carbon, silicon and germanium are not affected by water. Tin decomposes steam to form dioxide and dihydrogen gas.**

**Sn + 2H\({}_{2}\)O \(\xrightarrow{\Delta}\) SnO\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)**

**Lead is unaffected by water, probably because of a protective oxide film formation.**

**(iii) Reactivity towards halogen**

**These elements can form halides of formula MX\({}_{2}\) and MX\({}_{4}\) (where X = F, Cl, Br, I). Except carbon, all other members react directly with halogen under suitable condition to make halides. Most of the MX\({}_{4}\) are covalent in nature. The central metal atom in these halides undergoes sp\({}^{3}\) hybridisation and the molecule is tetrahedral in shape. Exceptions are SnF\({}_{4}\) and PbF\({}_{4}\), which are ionic in nature. PbI\({}_{4}\) does not exist because Pb--I bond initially formed during the reaction does not release enough energy to unpair 6s\({}^{2}\) electrons and excite one of them to higher orbital to have four unpaired electrons around lead atom. Heavier members Ge to Pb are able to make halides of formula MX\({}_{2}\). Stability of dihalides increases down the group. Considering the thermal and chemical stability, GeX\({}_{4}\) is more stable than GeX\({}_{2}\), whereas PbX\({}_{2}\) is more than PbX\({}_{4}\). Except CCl\({}_{4}\), other tetrachlorides are easily hydrolysed by water because the central atom can accommodate the lone pair of electrons from oxygen atom of water molecule in \(d\) orbital.

Hydrolysis can be understood by taking the example of \(\mathrm{SiCl}_{4}\) It undergoes hydrolysis by initially accepting lone pair of electrons from water molecule in \(d\) orbitals of Si, finally leading to the formation of \(\mathrm{Si(OH)}_{4}\) as shown below :

Carbon also has unique ability to form \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) multiple bond swith itself and with other atoms of small size and high electronegativity. Few examples of multiple bonding are C=C, C = C, C = C, C = S, and C = N. Heavier elements do not form \(p\pi\)- \(p\pi\) bonds because their atomic orbitals are too large and diffuse to have effective overlapping.

Carbon atoms have the tendency to link with one another through covalent bonds to form chains and rings. This property is called **catenation**. This is because C--C bonds are very strong. Down the group the size increases and electronegativity decreases, and, thereby, tendency to show catenation decreases. This can be clearly seen from bond enthalpies values. The order of catenation is C >> Si > Ge \(\approx\) Sn. Lead does not show catenation.

\begin{tabular}{|l l|} \hline
**Bond** & **Bond enthalpy / kJ mol** \\ \hline C--C & 348 \\ Si --Si & 297 \\ Ge--Ge & 260 \\ Sn--Sn & 240 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Due to property of catenation and \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) bond formation, carbon is able to show allotropic forms.

### Allotropes of Carbon

Carbon exhibits many allotropic forms: both crystalline as well as amorphous. Diamond and graphite are two well-known crystalline forms of carbon. In 1985, third form of carbon known as **fullerenes** was discovered by H.W.Kroto. E.Smalley and R.F.Curl. For this discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996.

#### Diamond

It has a crystalline lattice. In diamond each carbon atom undergoes \(sp^{3}\) hybridisation and linked to four other carbon atoms by using hybridised orbitals in tetrahedral fashion. The C-C bond length is 154 pm. The structure extends in space and produces a rigid three-dimensional network of carbon atoms. In this structure (Fig. 3.3) directional covalent bonds are present throughout the lattice.

It isvery difficult to break extended covalent bonding and, therefore, diamond is a hardest substance on the earth. It is used as an abrasive for sharpening hard tools, in making dies and in the manufacture of tungsten filaments for electric light bulbs.

**Problem 3.7**

Diamond is covalent, yet it has high melting point. Why?

**Solution**

Diamond has a three-dimensional network involving strong C--C bonds, which are very difficult to break and, in turn has high melting point.

#### Graphite

Graphite has layered structure (Fig. 3.4). Layers are held by van der Waals forces and distance between two layers is 340 pm. Each layer is composed of planar hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. C--C bond length within the layer is 141.5 pm. Each carbon atom in hexagonal ring undergoes sp\({}^{2}\) hybridisation and makes three sigma bonds with three neighbouring carbon atoms. Fourth electron forms a \(\pi\) bond. The electrons are delocalised over the whole sheet. Electrons are mobile and, therefore, graphite conducts electricity along the sheet. Graphite cleaves easily between the layers and, therefore, it is very soft and slippery. For this reason graphite is used as a dry lubricant in machines running at high temperature, where oil cannot be used as a lubricant.

#### Fullerenes

Fullerenes are made by the heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gases such as helium or argon. The sooty material formed by condensation of vapourised C\({}^{n}\) small molecules consists of mainly C\({}_{60}\) with smaller quantity of C\({}_{70}\) and traces of fullerenes consisting of even number of carbon atoms up to 350 or above. Fullerenes are the only pure form of carbon because they have smooth structure without having 'dangling' bonds. Fullerenes are cage like molecules. C\({}_{60}\) molecule has a shape like soccer ball and called **Buckminsterfullerene** (Fig. 3.4).

It contains twenty six-membered rings and twelve five membered rings. A six membered ring is fused with six or five membered rings but a five membered ring can only fuse with six membered rings. All the carbon atoms are equal and they undergo sp\({}^{2}\) hybridisation. Each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds with other three carbon atoms. The remaining electron at each carbon is delocalised in

Figure 3.4: The structure of graphite

Figure 3.3: The structure of diamond

molecular orbitals, which in turn give aromatic character to molecule. This ball shaped molecule has 60 vertices and each one is occupied by one carbon atom and it also contains both single and double bonds with C-C distances of 143.5 pm and 138.3 pm respectively. Spherical fullerenes are also called _bucky balls_ in short.

_The structure of C60, Buckminsterfullerene : Note that molecule has the shape of a soccer ball (football)._

It is very important to know that graphite is thermodynamically most stable allotrope of carbon and, therefore, \(\Delta_{f}H^{\odot}\) of graphite is taken as zero. \(\Delta_{f}H^{\odot}\) values of diamond and fullerene, C60 are 1.90 and 38.1 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), respectively.

Other forms of elemental carbonlike carbon black, coke, and charcoal are all impure forms of graphite or fullerenes. Carbon black is obtained by burning hydrocarbons in a limited supply of air. Charcoal and coke are obtained by heating wood or coal respectively at high temperatures in the absence of air.

#### 11.7.4 Uses of Carbon

Graphite fibres embedded in plastic material form high strength, lightweight composites. The composites are used in products such as tennis rackets, fishing rods, aircrafts and canoes. Being good conductor, graphite is used for electrodes in batteries and industrial electrolysis. Crucibles made from graphite are inert to dilute acids and alkalies. Being highly porous, activated charcoal is used in adsorbing poisonous gases; also used in water filters to remove organic contaminators and in airconditioning system to control odur. Carbon black is used as black pigment in black ink and as filler in autmobile types. Coke is used as a fuel and largely as a reducing agent in metallurgy. Diamond is a precious stone and used in jewellery. It is measured in carats (1 carat = 200 mg).

#### 11.8 Some Important Compounds of Carbon and Silicon

_Oxides of Carbon_

Two important oxides of carbon are carbon monoxide, CO and carbon dioxide, CO2.

#### 11.8.1 Carbon Monoxide

Direct oxidation of C in limited supply of oxygen or air yields carbon monoxide.

#### 11.8.2 C(s) + O2(g) -> 2CO(g)

On small scale pure CO is prepared by dehydration of formic acid with concentrated H2SO4 at 373 K

HCOOH 373K

HCOOH 373K

H2O + CO

On commercial scale it is prepared by the passage of steam over hot coke. The mixture of CO and H2 thus produced is known as **water gas** or **synthesis gas**.

Water gas

When air is used instead of steam, a mixture of CO and N2 is produced, which is called **producer gas**.

Water gas and producer gas are very important industrial fuels. Carbon monoxide in water gas or producer gas can undergo further combustion forming carbon dioxide with the liberation of heat.

Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and almost water insoluble gas. It is a powerful reducing agent and reduces almost all metal oxides other than those of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminium and a few transition metals. This property of

Figure 11.5: The structure of C60, Buckminsterfullerene : Note that molecule has the shape of a soccer ball (football).

CO is used in the extraction of many metals from their oxides ores.

In CO molecule, there are one sigma and two \(\pi\) bonds between carbon and oxygen, :C = O:. Because of the presence of a lone pair on carbon, CO molecule acts as a donor and reacts with certain metals when heated to form metal carbonyls. The highly poisonous nature of CO arises because of its ability to form a **complex with haemoglobin**, which is about 300 times more stable than the oxygen-haemoglobin complex. This prevents haemoglobin in the red blood corpuscles from carrying oxygen round the body and ultimately resulting in death.

#### Carbon Dioxide

It is prepared by complete combustion of carbon and carbon containing fuels in excess of air.

In the laboratory it is conveniently prepared by the action of dilute HClon calcium carbonate.

On commercial scale it is obtained by heating limestone.

It is a colourless and odourless gas. Its low solubility in water makes it of immense biochemical and geo-chemical importance. With water, it forms carbonic acid, H2CO3whichis a weak dibasic acid and dissociates in two steps:

H2CO3(aq) + H2O(l) = HCO3(aq) + H3O'(aq) HCO3(aq) + H2O(l) = CO3^2(aq) + H3O'(aq)

H2CO3/HCO3buffersystemhelpstomaintainpHofbloodbetween7.26 to 7.42. Being acidic in nature, it combines with alkales to form metal carbonates.

Carbon dioxide, which is normally present to the extent of \(\sim\) 0.03 % by volume in the atmosphere, is removed from it by the process known as **photosynthesis**. It is the process by which green plants convert atmospheric CO2into carbohydrates such as glucose. The overall chemical change can be expressed as:

By this process plants make food for themselves as well as for animals and human beings. Unlike CO, itis not poisonous. But the increase in combustion of fossil fuels and decomposition of limestone for cement manufacture in recent years seem to increase the CO2content of the atmosphere. This may lead to increase in **green house effect** and thus, raise the temperature of the atmosphere which might have serious consequences.

Carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid in the form of **dry ice** by allowing the liquified CO2to expand rapidly. Dry ice is used as a refrigerant for ice-cream and frozen food. Gaseous CO2is extensively used to carbonate soft drinks. Being heavy and non-supporter of combustion itis used as fire extinguisher. A substantial amount of CO2isusedto manufacture urea.

In CO2molecule carbon atom undergoes _sp_ hybridisation. Two _sp_ hybridised orbitals of carbon atom overlap with two \(p\) orbitals of oxygen atoms to make two sigma bonds while other two electrons of carbon atom are involved in _p_n-_p_n bonding with oxygen atom. This results in its linear shape [with both C-O bonds of equal length (115 pm)] with no dipole moment. The resonance structures are shown below:

Resonance structures of carbon dioxide

#### Silicon Dioxide, SiO2

95% of the earth's crust is made up of silica and silicates. Silicon dioxide, commonly known as silica, occurs in several crystallographic forms. quartz, cristobaliteandtridymite are some of the crystalline forms of silica, and they are interconvertable at suitable temperature. Silicon dioxide is a covalent, three-dimensional

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:302]

Silicones being surrounded by non-polar alkyl groups are water repelling in nature. They have in general high thermal stability, high dielectric strength and resistance to oxidation and chemicals. They have wide applications. They are used as sealant, greases, electrical insulators and for water proofing of fabrics. Being biocompatible they are also used in surgical and cosmetic plants.

**Problem: 11.8**

What are silicones?

**Solution**

**Simple silicones consist of \(\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{Si}-\text{o}\\ \text{h}\end{array}\right)\) chains in which alkyl or phenyl groups occupy the remaining bonding positions on each silicon. They are hydrophobic (water repellant) in nature.**

#### Silicates

A large number of silicates minerals exist in nature. Some of the examples are feldspar, zeolites, mica and asbestos. The basic structural unit of silicates is SiO\({}_{4}^{~{}4}\) (Fig. 11.7) in which silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms in tetrahedron fashion. In silicates either the discrete unit is present or a number of such units are joined together via corners by sharing 1,2,3 or 4 oxygen atoms per silicate units. When silicate units are linked together, they form chain, ring, sheet or three-dimensional structures. Negative charge on silicate structure is neutralized by positively charged metal ions. If all the four corners are shared with other tetrahedral units, three-dimensional network is formed.

Two important man-made silicates are glass and cement.

#### Zeolites

If aluminium atoms replace few silicon atoms in three-dimensional network of silicon dioxide, overall structure known as aluminosilicate, acquires a negative charge. Cations such as Na\({}^{+}\), K\({}^{+}\) or Ca\({}^{2+}\) balance the negative charge. Examples are feldspar and zeolites. Zeolites are widely used as a catalyst in petrochemical industries for cracking of hydrocarbons and isomerisation, e.g., ZSM-5 (A type of zeolite) used to convert alcohols directly into gasoline. Hydrated zeolites are used as ion exchangers in softening of "hard" water.

**Summary**

**\(p\)-Block of the periodic table is unique in terms of having all types of elements - metals, non-metals and metalloids. There are six groups of \(p\)-block elements in the periodic table numbering from 13 to 18. Their valence shell electronic configuration _is \(\textbf{ns}^{+}\textbf{np}^{+}\)_ (except for Na\({}^{+}\). Differences in the **inner core** of their electronic configuration greatly influence their physical and chemical properties. As a consequence of this, a lot of variation in properties among these elements is observed. In addition to the _group oxidation state_ these elements show other oxidation states differing from the **real number of valence electrons by unit of two. While the group oxidation state is the most stable for the lighter elements of the group, lower oxidation states become progressively more stable for the heavier elements. The combined effect of size and availability of \(d\) orbitals considerably

Figure 11.7: (a) Tetrahedral structure of SiO\({}_{4}^{~{}4}\)-anion: (b) Representation of SiO\({}_{4}^{~{}4}\)-unit

influences the ability of these elements to form \(\pi\)-bonds. While the lighter elements form form \(\pi\)-\(p\pi\) bonds, the heavier ones form \(d\pi\)-\(p\pi\) or \(d\pi\)-\(d\pi\) bonds. Absence of \(d\) orbital in second period elements limits, the maximum covalency to 4 while heavier ones can exceed this limit.

Boron is a typical non-metal and the other members are metals. The availability of 3 valence electrons (2s\({}^{2}\)2p) for covalent bond formation using four orbitals (2s, 2p\({}_{x}\), 2p\({}_{y}\) and 2p\({}_{z}\)) leads to the so called **electron deficiency** in boron compounds. This deficiency makes them good electron acceptor and thus boron compounds behave as **Lewis acids**. Boron forms covalent molecular compounds with dihydrogen as boranes, the simplest of which is **diborane**. By \(d_{1}\), diborane contains two bridging hydrogen atoms between two boron atoms; these bridge bonds are considered to be **three-centre two-electron bonds**. The important compounds of boron with dioxygen are **brie acid** and **borax**. Boric acid, B(OH) is a weak **phonobasic acid**: it acts as a Lewis acid by accepting electrons from hydroxyl ion. Borax is a white crystalline solid of formula Na\({}_{2}\)[B\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{5}\)(OH)\({}_{3}\)-\({}_{2}\)O. The **borax bead test** gives characteristic colours of transition metals.

Ahumium exhibits +3 oxidation state. With heavier elements +1 oxidation state gets progressively stabilised on going down the group. This is a consequence of the so called **inert pair effect**.

Carbon is a typical non-metal forming covalent bonds employing all its four valence electrons (2s\({}^{2}\)2p). It shows the property of **catenation**. the ability to form chains or rings, not only with C-C single bonds but also with multiple bonds (C/C on C=C). The tendency to catenation decreases as C>>Si>Ge = Sn > Pb. Carbon provides one of the best examples of **dilotropy**. Three important allotropes of carbon are **damond**, **graphite** and **fullerenes**. The members of the carbon family mainly exhibit +1 and +2 oxidation states/ compounds in +4 oxidation states are generally covalent in nature. The tendency to show +2 oxidation state increases among heavier elements. Lead in +2 state is stable whereas in +4 oxidation state it is a strong oxidising agent. Carbon also exhibits negative oxidation states. It forms two important oxides: CO and CO\({}_{2}\). Carbon monoxide is neutral whereas CO\({}_{2}\) is acidic in nature. Carbon monoxide having long pair of electrons on C forms metal **carbonyls**. It is deadly poisonous due to higher stability of its **haemoglobin complex** as compared to that of oxyhaemoglobin complex. Carbon dioxide as such is no toxic. However, increased content of CO\({}_{2}\) in atmosphere due to combustion of fossil fuels and decomposition of limestone is feared to cause increase in green house effect'. This, in turn, raises the temperature of the atmosphere and causes serious complications. **Silica**, **silicates** and **silicones** are important class of compounds and find applications in industry and technology.

## Chapter 12 Organic Chemistry - Some Basic Principles and Techniques

In the previous unit you have learnt that the element carbon has the unique property called **catenation** due to which it forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms. It also forms covalent bonds with atoms of other elements like by dr oxygen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus and halogens. The resulting compounds are studied under a separate branch of chemistry called **organic chemistry**. This unit incorporates some basic principles and techniques of analysis required for understanding the formation and properties of organic compounds.

### 12.1 General Introduction

Organic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth and include complex molecules like genetic information bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that constitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and skin. Organic chemicals appear in materials like clothing, fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of the important areas of application of these compounds.

Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to distinguish between organic compounds obtained from plants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared from mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist proposed that a 'vital force' was responsible for the formation of organic compounds. However, this notion was rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an organic compound, urea from an inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate.

NH4CNO Heat NH2CONH2

Ammonium cyanate Urea

The pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe (1845) and that of methane by Berthelot (1856) showed conclusively that organic compounds could be synthesised from inorganic sources in a laboratory.

The development of electronic theory of covalent bonding ushered organic chemistry into its modern shape.

### TETRAVALENCE OF CARBON: SHAPES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

#### 12.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds

The knowledge of fundamental concepts of molecular structure helps in understanding and predicting the properties of organic compounds. You have already learnt theories of valency and molecular structure in Unit 4. Also, you already know that tetravalence of carbon and the formation of covalent bonds by it are explained in terms of its electronic configuration and the hybridisation of \(s\) and \(p\) orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and the shapes of molecules like methane (CH\({}_{s}\)), ethene (C\({}_{s}\)H\({}_{s}\)), ethyne (C\({}_{s_{2}}\)H\({}_{s_{2}}\)) are explained in terms of the use of \(sp^{3}\), \(sp^{2}\) and \(sp\) hybrid orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective molecules.

Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in organic compounds. The \(sp\) hybrid orbital contains more \(s\) character and hence it is closer to its nucleus and forms shorter and stronger bonds than the \(sp^{3}\) hybrid orbital. The \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbital is intermediate in \(s\) character between \(sp\) and \(sp^{3}\) and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate between them. The change in hybridisation affects the electronegativity of carbon. The greater the \(s\) character of the hybrid orbitals, the greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a carbon atom having an \(sp\) hybrid orbital with 50% \(s\) character is more electronegative than that possessing \(sp^{2}\) or \(sp^{3}\) hybridised orbitals. This relative electronegativity is reflected in several physical and chemical properties of the molecules concerned, about which you will learn in later units.

#### 12.2.2 Some Characteristic Features of Bonds

In a \(\pi\) (pjl) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two \(p\) orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap. Thus, in H\({}_{2}\)C=CH\({}_{2}\) molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The \(p\) orbitals are mutually parallel and both the \(p\) orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Rotation of one CH\({}_{2}\) fragment with respect to other interferes with maximum overlap of \(p\) orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is restricted. The electron charge cloud of the \(\pi\) bond is located above and below the plane of bonding atoms. This results in the electrons being easily available to the attacking reagents. In general, \(\pi\) bonds provide the most reactive centres in the molecules containing multiple bonds.

**Problem 12.1**

How many \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\) bonds are present in each of the following molecules?

(a) HC=CCH=CHCH\({}_{3}\) (b) CH\({}_{2}\)=C=CHCH\({}_{3}\)

(a) \(\sigma_{\text{c-c}}\): 4; \(\sigma_{\text{c-H}}\): 6; \(\pi_{\text{c-c}}\):1; \(\pi\) C=C:2

(a) CH\({}_{3}\)Cl, (b) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CO, (c) CH\({}_{3}\)CN,

#### 12.3.2 Three-Dimensional Representation of Organic Molecules

The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of organic molecules can be represented on paper by using certain conventions. For example, by using solid () and dashed () wedge formula, the 3-D image of a molecule from a two-dimensional picture can be perceived. In these formulas the solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond projecting out of the plane of paper, towards the observer. The dashed-wedge is used to depict the bond projecting out of the plane of the paper and away from the observer. Wedges are shown in such a way that the broad end of the wedge is towards the observer. The bonds lying in plane of the paper are depicted by using a normal line (). 3-D representation of methane molecule on paper has been shown in Fig. 12.1.

**Molecular Models**

Molecular models are physical devices that are used for a better visualisation and perception of three-dimensional shapes of organic molecules. These are made of wood, plastic or metal and are commercially available. Commonly three types of molecular models are used: (1) _Framework model._ (2) _Ball-and-stick model._ and (3) _Space filling model._ In the _framework model_ only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule and not the atoms themselves are shown. This model emphasizes the pattern of bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size of atoms. In the _ball-and-stick model._ both the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls represent atoms and the stick denotes a bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g., ethene) can best be represented by using springs in place of sticks. These models are referred to as _ball-and-spring model._ The _space-filling model_ emphasises the relative size of each atom based on its van der Waals radius. Bonds are not shown in this model. It conveys the volume occupied by each atom in the molecule. In addition to these models, computer graphics can also be used for molecular modelling.

### CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

The existing large number of organic compounds and their ever-increasing numbers has made it necessary to classify them on the basis of their structures. Organic compounds are broadly classified as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Organic compounds & \\ \end{tabular}

### Heterocyclic aromatic compounds

Organic compounds can also be classified on the basis of functional groups, into _families_ or _homologous series_.

### Functional Group

The functional group may be defined as an atom or group of atoms joined in a specific manner which is responsible for the characteristic chemical properties of the organic compounds. The examples are hydroxyl group (-OH), aldehyde group (-CHO) and carboxylic acid group (-COOH) etc.

### Homologous Series

A group or a series of organic compounds each containing a characteristic functional group forms a homologous series and the members of the series are called _homologues_. The members of a homologous series can be represented by general molecular formula and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by a -CH2 unit. There are a number of homologous series of organic compounds. Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, haloalkanes, alkaloids, alkalanols, alkanols, alkanonics, alkanoic acids, amines etc.

### Nomenclature of Organic compounds

Organic chemistry deals with millions of compounds. In order to clearly identify them, a systematic method of naming has been developed and is known as the **IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry)** system of nomenclature. In this systematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the reader or listener can deduce the structure from the name.

Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named so because it is found in citrus fruits and the acid found in red ant is named formic acid since the Latin word for ant is _formica_. These names are traditional and are considered as _trivial_ or _common names_. Some common names are followed even today. For example, Buckminsterfullerene is a common name given to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a form of carbon) noting its structural similarity to the geodesic domes popularised by the famous architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Common names are useful and in many cases indispensable, particularly when the alternative systematic names are lengthy and complicated. Common names of some organic compounds are given in Table 12.1.

#### 12.5.1 The IUPAC System of Nomenclature

A systematic name of an organic compound is generally derived by identifying the parent hydrocarbon and the functional group(s) attached to it. See the example given below.

Table 12.4 Some Functional Groups and Classes of Organic Compounds

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:319]

If benzene ring is disubstituted, the position of substituents is defined by numbering the carbon atoms of the rings such that the substituents are located at the lowest numbers possible.For example, the compound(b) is named as \(1,3\)-dibromobenzene and not as \(1,5\)-dibromobenzene.

In the trivial system of nomenclature the terms \(ortho(o)\), \(meta(m)\) and \(para(p)\) are used as prefixes to indicate the relative positions \(1,2\)- \(;1,3\)- and \(1,4\)- respectively. Thus, \(1,3\)-dibromobenzene (\(b\)) is named as \(m\)-dibromobenzene (\(meta\) is abbreviated as \(m\)-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene \(1,2\)-(a) and \(1,4\)-(c), are named as \(ortho\) (or just \(o\)-) and \(para\) (or just \(p\)-)-dibromobenzene, respectively.

For tri - or higher substituted benzene derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used and the compounds are named by identifying substituent positions on the ring by following the lowest locant rule. In some cases, common name of benzene derivatives is taken as the base compound.

When a benzene ring is attached to an alkane with a functional group, it is considered as substituent, instead of a parent. The name for benzene as substituent is \(phenyl(C_{5}H_{5}\)-, also abbreviated as Ph).

on the carbon atom and hence the carbon atom becomes an electrophilic centre at which a nucleophile can attack.

**Problem 12.11**

Using curved-arrow notation, show the formation of reactive intermediateswhen the following covalent bonds undergo heterolytic cleavage.

(a) CH3-SCH3, (b) CH3-CN, (c) CH3-Cu

**Solution**

(a) CH3-SCH3-CNCH3+SCH3

(b) CH3-CNCN

(c) CH3-CuCu

**Problem 12.12**

HS, BF3,C2H5O, (CH3)3N:,

Cl,CH3C=O,H2N:, NO2

**Solution**

_Nucleophiles:HS^,C2H5O^,(CH3)3N:,H2N:-_

**These species have unshared pair of electrons, which can be donated and shared with an electrophile.**

_Electrophiles:_BF3,Cl,CH3-C=O,NNO2.

Reactive sites have only six valence electrons; can accept electron pair from a nucleophile.

**Problem 12.13**

Identify electrophilic centre in the following: CH3CH=O, CH3CN, CH3I.

**Solution**

Among CH3HC=O, H3CC=N, and H3C-I, the starred carbon atoms are electrophilic centers as they will have partial positive charge due to polarity of the bond.

#### Electron Movement in Organic Reactions

**The movement of electrons in organic reactions can be shown by curved-arrow notation. It shows how changes in bonding occur due to electronic redistribution during the reaction. To show the change in position of a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts from the point from where an electron pair is shifted and it ends at a location to which the pair of electron may move.**

**Presentation of shifting of electron pair is given below :**

(i) = Y= -Y= from \(\pi\) bond to adjacent bond position

(ii) = Y -Y -Y= from \(\pi\) bond to adjacent atom

(iii) = Y -Y= from atom to adjacent bond position

Movement of single electron is indicated by a single barbed 'fish hooks' (i.e. half headed curved arrow). For example, in transfer of hydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the dissociation of chloromethane, the movement of electron using curved arrows can be depicted as follows:

#### Electron Displacement Effects in Covalent Bonds

**The electron displacement in an organic molecule may take place either in the ground state under the influence of an atom or a substituent group or in the presence of an appropriate attacking reagent. The electron displacements due to the influence of an atom or a substituent group present in the molecule cause permanent polarisation of the bond. Inductive effect and resonance effects are examples of this type of electron displacements. Temporary electron displacement effects are seen in a molecule when a reagent approaches to attack it. This type of electron displacement is called electromeric effect or polarisability effect. In the following sections we will learn about these types of electronic displacements.

#### 12.7.5 Inductive Effect

When a covalent bond is formed between atoms of different electronegativity, the electron density is more towards the more electronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift of electron density results in a polar covalent bond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic effects in organic compounds.

Let us consider choloret hane (CH3CH2Cl) in which the C-Cl bond is a polar covalent bond. It is polarised in such a way that the carbon-1 gains some positive charge (\(\delta^{*}\)) and the chlorine some negative charge (\(\delta^{*}\)). The fractional electromeric charges on the two atoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted by symbol \(\delta\) (delta) and the shift of electron density is shown by an arrow that points from \(\delta^{*}\) to \(\delta^{*}\) end of the polar bond.

In turn carbon-1, which has developed partial positive charge (\(\delta^{*}\)) draws some electron density towards it from the adjacent C-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge (\(\delta\delta^{*}\)) develops on carbon-2 also, where \(\delta\delta^{*}\) symbolises relatively smaller positive charge as compared to that on carbon - 1. In other words, the polar C - Cl bond induces polarity in the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of \(\sigma\)-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent \(\sigma\)-bond is referred to as the **inductive effect**. This effect is passed on to the subsequent bonds also but the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intervening bonds increases and becomes vanishingly small after three bonds. The inductive effect is related to the ability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or donate electron density to the attached carbon atom. Based on this ability, the substituents can be classified as _electron-withdrawing_ or _electron donating_ groups relative to hydrogen. Halogens and many other groups such as nitro(-NO2), cyano (-CN), carboxy (-COOH), ester (-COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. - OC6H5), etc. are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-CH2-CH3) are usually considered as electron donating groups.

**Problem 12.14**

**Which bond is more polar in the following pairs of molecules: (a) H3C-H, H3C-Br (b) H3C-NH2, H3C-OH (c) H3C-OH, H3C-SH Solution**

(a) C-Br, since Bris more electronegative than H, (b) C-O, (c) C-O

**Problem 12.15**

In which C-C bond of CH3CH2CH2Br, the inductive effect is expected to be the least?

**Solution**

**Magnitude of inductive effect diminishes as the number of intervening bonds increases. Hence, the effect is least in the bond between carbon-3 and hydrogen.**

#### 12.7.6 Resonance Structure

**There are many organic molecules whose behaviour cannot be explained by a single Lewis structure. An example is that of benzene. Its cyclic structure containing alternating C-C single and C=C double bonds shown is inadequate for explaining its Benzene characteristic properties.**

**As per the above representation, benzene should exhibit two different bond lengths, due to C-C single and C=C double bonds. However, as determined experimentally benzene has a uniform C-C bond distances of 139 pm, a value intermediate between the C-C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134 pm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene cannot be represented adequately by the above structure. Further, benzene can be represented equally well by the energetically identical structures I and II.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:326]

**Problem 12.18**

 Explain why the following two structures. I and II cannot be the major contributors to the real structure of CH\({}_{3}\)COOCH\({}_{3}\).

**Solution**

 The two structures are less important contributors as they involve charge separation. Additionally, structure I contains a carbon atom with an incomplete octet.

#### 12.7.7 Resonance Effect

The resonance effect is defined as 'the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two \(\pi\)-bonds or between a \(\pi\)-bond and lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom'. The effect is transmitted through the chain. There are two types of resonance or mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect.

_(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect)_

 In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. This electron displacement makes certain positions in the molecule of high electron densities. This effect in aniline is shown as :

_(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (-R effect)_

 This effect is observed when the transfer of electrons is towards the atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. For example in nitrobenzene this electron displacement can be depicted as :

The atoms or substituent groups, which represent +R or -R electron displacement effects are as follows :

+R effect: - halogen, -OH, -OR, -COOR, -NH\({}_{2}\), -NHR, -NR\({}_{2}\), -NHCOR,

- COOH, -CHO, >C=O,
- CN, -NO\({}_{2}\)

 The presence of alternate single and double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system is termed as a conjugated system. These systems often show abnormal behaviour. The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the \(\pi\)-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity.

#### 12.7.8 Electronic Effect (E effect)

It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a **multiple bond** (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of an attacking reagent only. It is defined as the complete transfer of a shared pair of \(\pi\)-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond on the demand of an attacking reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the attacking reagent is removed from the domain of the reaction. It is represented by E and the shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved arrow ( \(\nearrow\)). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect.

(i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In this effect the \(\pi\)-electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the reagent gets attached. For example :

(ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (-E effect) In this effect the \(\pi\) - electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the attacking reagent does not get attached. For example:When inductive and electromeric effects operatein opposite directions, the electomeric effect predominates.

12.7.9 Hyperconjugation

Hyperconjugation is a general stabilising interaction. It involves delocalisation of \(\sigma\) electrons of C--H bond of an alkyl group directly attached to an atom of unsaturated system or to an atom with an unshared \(p\) orbital. The \(\sigma\) electrons of C--H bond of the alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with the attached unsaturated system or with the unshared \(p\) orbital. Hyperconjugation is a permanent effect.

To understand hyperconjugation effect, let us take an example of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\) (ethyl cation) in which the positively charged carbon atom has an empty \(p\) orbital. One of the C--H bonds of the methyl group can align in the plane of this empty \(p\) orbital and the electrons constituting the C--H bond in plane with this \(p\) orbital can then be delocalised into the empty \(p\) orbital as depicted in Fig. 12.4 (a).

**Fig. 12.4(a)**_Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in ethyl cation_

This type of overlap stabilises the carbocation because electron density from the adjacent \(\sigma\) bond helps in dispersing the positive charge.

In general, greater the number of alkyl groups attached to a positively charged carbon atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation interaction and stabilisation of the cation. Thus, we have the following relative stability of carbocations :

**Hyperconjugation is also possible in alkenes and alkylarenes.**

**Delocalisation of electrons by hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can be depicted as in Fig. 12.4(b).**

**Fig. 12.4(b)**_Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in propene_

There are various ways of looking at the hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to regard C--H bond as possessing partial ionic character due to resonance.

The hyperconjugation may also be regarded as no bond resonance.

**Problem 12.19**: Explain why (CH\({}_{3}\)),Cis more stable than CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\) and CH\({}_{3}\)is the least stable cation.
**Solution**

Hyperconjugation interaction in (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\) is greater than in CH\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{H_{2}}\) as the (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C has nine C-H bonds. In CH\({}_{3}\), vacant \(p\) orbital is perpendicular to the plane in which C-H bonds lie; hence cannot overlap with it. Thus, \({}_{3}^{\star}\)C\({}_{H_{3}}\) lacks hyperconjugative stability.

**12.7.10 Types of Organic Reactions and Mechanisms**

Organic reactions can be classified into the following categories:

(i) **Substitution reactions**

(ii) **Addition reactions**

(iii) **Elimination reactions**

(iv) **Rearrangement reactions**

You will be studying these reactions in Unit 13 and later in class XII.

**12.8 METHODS OF PURIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS**

Once an organic compound is extracted from a natural source or synthesised in the laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various methods used for the purification of organic compounds are based on the nature of the compound and the impurity present in it.

The common techniques used for purification are as follows:

(i) **Sublimation**

(ii) **Crystallisation**

(iii) **Distillation**

(iv) **Differential extraction and**

(v) **Chromatography**

Finally, the purity of a compound is ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point. Most of the pure compounds have sharp melting points and boiling points. New methods of checking the purity of an organic compound are based on different types of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.

**12.8.1**: **Sublimation**

You have learnt earlier that on heating, some solid substances change from solid to vapour state without passing through liquid state. The purification technique based on the above principle is known as sublimation and is used to separate sublimable compounds from non-sublimable impurities.

**12.8.2**: **Crystallisation**

This is one of the most commonly used techniques for the purification of solid organic compounds. It is based on the difference in the solubilities of the compound and the impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it is sparingly soluble at room temperature but appreciably soluble at higher temperature. The solution is concentrated to get a nearly saturated solution. On cooling the solution, pure compound crystallises out and is removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother liquor) contains impurities and small quantity of the compound. If the compound is highly soluble in one solvent and very little soluble in another solvent, crystallisation can be satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to the solution are removed by adsorbing over activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation becomes necessary for the purification of compounds containing impurities of comparable solubilities.

**12.8.3**: **Distillation**

This important method is used to separate (i) volatile liquids from nonvola tile impurities and (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference in their boiling points. Liquids having different boiling points vaporise at different temperatures. The vapours are cooled and the liquids so formed are collected separately. Chloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457 K) are easily separated by the technique of distillation (Fig 12.5). The liquid mixture is taken in a round bottom flask and heated carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower boiling component are formed first. The vapours are condensed by using a condenser and the liquid is collected in a receiver. The vapours of higher boiling component form later and the liquid can be collected separately.

_Fractional Distillation:_ If the difference in boiling points of two liquids is not much, simple distillation cannot be used to separate them. The vapours of such liquids are formed within the same temperature range and are condensed simultaneously. The technique of fractional distillation is used in such cases. In this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are passed through a fractionating column before condensation. The fractionating column is fitted over the mouth of the round bottom flask (Fig.12.6).

Figure 12.6: Fractional distillation. The vapours of lower boiling fraction reach the top of the column first followed by vapours of higher boiling fractions.

Figure 12.5: Simple distillation. The vapours of a substance formed are condensed and the liquid is collected in conical flask.

**Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling point condense before the vapours of the liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours rising up in the fractionating column become richer in more volatile component. By the time the vapours reach to the top of the fractionating column, these are rich in the more volatile component. Fractionating columns are available in various sizes and designs as shown in Fig. 12.7. A fractionating column provides many surfaces for heat exchange between the ascending vapours and the descending condensed liquid. Some of the condensing liquid in the fractionating column obtains heat from the ascending vapours and reavorises. The vapours thus become richer in low boiling component. The vapours of low boiling component ascend to the top of the column. On reaching the top, the vapours become pure in low boiling component and pass through the condenser and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver. After a series of successive distillations, the remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets enriched in high boiling component. Each successive condensation and vaporisation unit in the fractionating column is called a _theoretical plate_. Commercially, columns with hundreds of plates are available.

One of the technological applications of fractional distillation is to separate different fractions of _crude oil in petroleum industry_.

_Distillation under reduced pressure:_ This method is used to purify liquids having very high boiling points and those, which decompose at or below their boiling points. Such liquids are made to boil at a temperature lower than their normal boiling points by reducing the pressure on their surface. A liquid boils at a temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the external pressure. The pressure is reduced with the help of a water pump or vacuum pump (Fig. 12.8). Glycerol can be separated from spent-lye in soap industry by using this technique.

_Steam Distillation:_ This technique is applied to separate substances which are steam volatile and are immiscible with water. In steam distillation, steam from a steam generator is passed through a heated flask containing the liquid to be distilled. The mixture of steam and the volatile organic compound is condensed and collected. The compound is later separated from water using a separating funnel. In steam distillation, the liquid boils when the sum of vapour pressures due to the organic liquid (\(p_{1}\)) and that due to water (\(p_{2}\)) becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure (\(p\)), i.e. \(p\) =\(p_{1}\)+ \(p_{2}\). Since \(p_{1}\) is lower than \(p\), the organic liquid vaporises at lower temperature than its boiling point.

Thus, if one of the substances in the mixture is water and the other, a water insoluble substance, then the mixture will boil close to but below, 373K. A mixture of water and the substance is obtained which can be separated by using a separating funnel. Aniline is separated by this technique from aniline - water mixture (Fig. 12.9).

#### Differential Extraction

When an organic compound is present in an aqueous medium, it is separated by shaking

Figure 12.7: Different types of fractionating columns.

**Fig.12.8**: _Distillation under reduced pressure. A liquid boils at a temperature below its vapour pressure by reducing the pressure._

**Fig.12.9**: _Steam distillation. Steam volatile component volatilizes, the axpours condense in the condenser and the liquid collects in conical flask._it with an organic solvent in which it is more soluble than in water. The organic solvent and the aqueous solution should be immiscible with each other so that they form two distinct layers which can be separated by separatory funnel. The organic solvent is later removed by distillation or by evaporation to get back the compound. Differential extraction is carried out in a separatory funnel as shown in Fig. 12.10.

If the organic compound is less mixture get gradually separated from one another. The moving phase is called the mobile phase.

Based on the principle involved, chromatography is classified into different categories. Two of these are:

1. Adsorption chromatography, and
2. Partition chromatography.

_a) Adsorption Chromatography:_ Adsorption chromatography is based on the fact that different compounds are adsorbed on an adsorbent to different degrees. Commonly used adsorbents are silica gel and alumina. When a mobile phase is allowed to move over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the components of the mixture move by varying distances over the stationary phase. Following are two main types of chromatographic techniques based on the principle of differential adsorption.
2. Column chromatography, and
3. Thin layer chromatography.

_Column Chromatography:_ Column chromatography involves separation of a mixture over a column of adsorbent (stationary phase) packed in a glass tube. The column is fitted with a stopcock at its lower end (Fig. 12.11).

The mixture adsorbed on

Figure 12.10: Differential extraction. Extraction of compound takes place based on difference in solubility

Figure 12.11: Column chromatography. Different stages of separation of components of a mixture.

adsorbent is placed on the top of the adsorbent column packed in a glasstube. An appropriate eluant which is a liquid or a mixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the column slowly. Depending upon the degree to which the compounds are adsorbed, complete separation takes place. The most readily adsorbed substances are retained near the top and others come down to various distances in the column (Fig.12.11).

_Thin Layer Chromatography:_ Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is another type of adsorption chromatography, which involves separation of substances of a mixture over a thin layer of an adsorbent coated on glass plate. A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of an adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread over a glass plate of suitable size. The plate is known as _thin layer chromatography plate or chromoplate_. The solution of the mixture to be separated is applied as a small spot about 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate. The glass plate is then placed in a closed jar containing the eluant (Fig. 12.12a). As the eluant rises up the plate, the components of the mixture move up along with the eluant to different distances depending on their degree of adsorption and separation takes place. The relative adsorption of each component of the mixture is expressed in terms of its **retardation factor** i.e. **R\({}_{f}\) value** (Fig.12.12 b).

\(R_{f}=\frac{\text{Distance moved by the substance from b case line (x)}}{\text{Distance moved by the solvent from base line (y)}}\)

The spots of coloured compounds are visible on TLC plate due to their original colour. The spots of colourless compounds, which are invisible to the eye but fluoresce, can be detected by putting the plate under ultraviolet light. Another detection technique is to place the plate in a covered jar containing a few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds, which adsorb iodine, will show up as brown spots. Sometimes an appropriate reagent may also be sprayed on the plate. For example, amino acids may be detected by spraying the plate with minhydrin solution (Fig.12.12b).

_Partition Chromatography:_ Partition chromatography is based on continuous differential partitioning of components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. Paper chromatography is a type of partition chromatography. In paper chromatography, a special quality paper known as chromatography paper is used. Chromatography paper contains water trapped in it, which acts as the stationary phase.

A strip of chromatography paper spotted at the base with the solution of the mixture is suspended in a suitable solvent or a mixture of solvents (Fig. 12.13). This solvent acts as the mobile phase. The solvent rises up the paper by capillary action and flows over the spot. The paper selectively retains different components according to their differing partition in the two phases. The paper strip so developed is known as a chromatogram. The spots of the separated coloured compounds are visible at different heights from the position of initial spot on the chromatogram. The spots of the separated colourless compounds may be observed either

#### 12.10.6 Oxygen

The percentage of oxygen in an organic compound is usually found by difference between the total percentage composition (100) and the sum of the percentages of all other elements. However, oxygen can also be estimated directly as follows:

A definite mass of an organic compound is decomposed by heating in a stream of nitrogen gas. The mixture of gaseous products containing oxygen is passed over red-hot coke when all the oxygen is converted to carbon monoxide. This mixture is passed through warm iodine pentoxide (I2O5) when carbon monoxide is oxidised to carbon dioxide producing iodine.

In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding in organic compounds can be described in terms of _orbitals_ hybridization concept, according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethere and ethyne respectively. The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1/orbital of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C-H) single bond (sigma, bond). Overlap of a sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon-carbon bond. The only hydised \(p\) orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo several (side-by-side) overlap to give a pi (\(\pi\) bond). Organic compounds can be represented by various structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper can be drawn by wedge and dash formula.

Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A _Functional group_ is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a unique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name.

Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents the electron displacement effects and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in **heterolytic** or **homolytic** fashion. A heterolytic cleavage yields **carbonations** or **carbonations**. While a homolytic cleavage gives **free radicals** as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as **nucleophile** and an electron pair acceptor known as **electronic**. The **C**nductive**, **resonance**, **electronic** and **hyperconjugation effects** may help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.

Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types: **substitution**, **addition**, **elimination** and **earrangement** reactions.

Purification qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimatation, distillation and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties.

**Chromatorography** is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of compounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition/chromography. Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. Nitrogen, sulphur, halogen, and phosphorus are detected by **Lassagne's test**. Carbon and hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. Nitrogen is estimated by **Dumas** or **Kjeldahl's** method and halogens by **Carhus** method.

Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.

to V? If you go on constructing structures for higher alkanes, you will be getting still larger number of isomers. \(\mathrm{C_{6}H_{14}}\) has got five isomers and \(\mathrm{C_{7}H_{16}}\) has nine. As many as 75 isomers are possible for \(\mathrm{C_{10}H_{22}}\).

In structures II, IV and V, you observed that \(-\mathrm{CH_{3}}\) group is attached to carbon atom numbered as 2. You will come across groups like \(-\mathrm{CH_{3}}-\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}},-\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}}\) etc. attached to carbon atoms in alkanes or other classes of compounds. These groups or substituents are known as alkyl groups as they are derived from alkanes by removal of one hydrogen atom. General formula for alkyl groups is \(\mathrm{C_{n}H_{2n+1}}\) (Unit 12).

Let us recall the general rules for nomenclature already discussed in Unit 12. Nomenclature of substituted alkanes can further be understood by considering the following problem:

**Problem 13.2**

Write structures of different isomeric alkyl groups corresponding to the molecular formula \(\mathrm{C_{5}H_{11}}\). Write IUPAC names of alcohols obtained by attachment of \(-\mathrm{OH}\) groups at different carbons of the chain.

**Solution**

\(\mathrm{CH_{3}-CH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{CH_{3}-CH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-OH}\)

If it is important to write the correct IUPAC name for a given structure, it is equally important to write the correct structure from the given IUPAC name. To do this, first of all, the longest chain of carbon atoms corresponding to the parent alkane is written. Then after numbering it, the substituents are attached to the correct carbon atoms and finally valence of each carbon atom is satisfied by putting the correct number of hydrogen atoms. This can be clarified by writing the structure of 3- ethyl-2, 2-dimethylpentane in the following steps :

#### 13.2.4 Conformations

Alkanes contain carbon-carbon sigma (\(\phi\)) bonds. Electron distribution of the sigma molecular orbital is symmetrical around the internuclear axis of the C-C bond which is not disturbed due to rotation about its axis. This permits free rotation about C-C single bond. This rotation results into different spatial arrangements of atoms in space which can change into one another. Such spatial arrangements of atoms which can be converted into one another by rotation around a C-C single bond are called **conformations** or **conformers** or **rotamers**. Alkanes can thus have infinite number of conformations by rotation around C-C single bonds. However, it may be remembered that rotation around a C-C single bond is not completely free. It is hindered by a small energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction is called **torsional strain**.

_Conformations of ethane :_ Ethane molecule (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{\phi}\)) contains a carbon - carbon single bond with each carbon atom attached to three hydrogen atoms. Considering the ball and stick model of ethane, keep one carbon atom stationary and rotate the other carbon atom around the C-C axis. This rotation results into infinite number of spatial arrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to one carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen atoms attached to the other carbon atom. These are called **conformational isomers** (conformers). Thus there are infinite number of conformations of ethane. However, there are two extreme cases. One such conformation in which hydrogen atoms attached to two carbons are as closed together as possible is called **eclipsed** conformation and the other in which hydrogens are as far apart as possible is known as the staggered conformation. Any other intermediate conformation is called a **skew** conformation.It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles and the bond lengths remain the same. Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by **Sawhorse** and **Newman projections**.

_1. Sawhorse projections_

In this projection, the molecule is viewed along the molecular axis. It is then projected on paper by drawing the central C-C bond as a somewhat longer straight line. Upper end of the line is slightly tilted towards right or left hand side. The front carbon is shown at the lower end of the line, whereas the rear carbon is shown at the upper end. Each carbon has three lines attached to it corresponding to three hydrogen atoms. The lines are inclined at an angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\) to each other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed and staggered conformations of ethane are depicted in Fig. 13.2.

_2. Newman projections_

In this projection, the molecule is viewed at the C-C bond head on. The carbon atom nearer to the eye is represented by a point. Three hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon atom are shown by three lines drawn at an angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\) to each other. The rear carbon atom (the carbon atom away from the eye) is represented by a circle and the three hydrogen atoms are shown attached to it by the shorter lines drawn at an angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\) to each other. The Newman's projections are depicted in Fig. 13.3.

_2._

Fig. 13.3: Newman’s projections of ethane

Fig. 13.2: Sawhorse projections of ethane_Relative stability of conformations:_ As mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane, the electron clouds of carbon- hydrogen bonds are as far apart as possible. Thus, there are minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy and maximum stability of the molecule. On the other hand, when the staggered form changes into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the carbon- hydrogen bonds come closer to each other resulting in increase in electron cloud repulsions. To check the increased repulsive forces, molecule will have to possess more energy and thus has lesser stability. As already mentioned, the repulsive interaction between the electron clouds, which affects stability of a conformation, is called **torsional strain**. Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about C-C bond. This angle is also called **dihedral angle** or **torsional angle**. Of all the conformations of ethane, the _staggered form has the least torsional strain and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional strain_. Thus it may be inferred that rotation around C-C bond in ethane is not completely free. The energy difference between the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), which is very small. Even at ordinary temperatures, the ethane molecule gains thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon single bond in ethane is almost free for all practical purposes. It has not been possible to separate and isolate different conformational isomers of ethane.

### 13.3 Alkenes

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. What should be the general formula of alkenes? If there is one double bond between two carbon atoms in alkenes, they must possess two hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, general formula for alkenes is C\({}_{\mathrm{n}}\)H\({}_{2\mathrm{n}}\). Alkenes are also known as olefins (oil forming) since the first member, ethylene orhene (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)) was found to form an oily liquid on reaction with chlorine.

#### 13.3.1 Structure of Double Bond

Carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes consists of one strong sigma (\(\sigma\)) bond (bond enthalpy about 397 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) due to head-on overlapping of \(sp^{2}\) hybridised orbitals and one weak pi (\(\pi\)) bond (bond enthalpy about 284 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) obtained by lateral or sideways overlapping of the two \(2p\) orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in bond length (134 pm) than the C-C single bond (154 pm). You have already read that the pi (\(\pi\)) bond is a weaker bond due to poor sideways overlapping between the two \(2p\) orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (\(\pi\)) bond makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are easily attacked by reagents or compounds which are in search of electrons. Such reagents are called **electrophilic reagents**. The presence of weaker \(\pi\)-bond makes alkenes unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes and thus, alkenes can be changed into single bond compounds by combining with the electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) is greater than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)). Orbital diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in Figs. 13.4 and 13.5.

#### 13.3.2 Nomenclature

For nomend ature of alkenes in IUPAC system, the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the double bond is selected. Numbering of the chain is done from the end which is nearer to the double bond. The suffix '_ene_' replaces '_ane_'

This can be understood by drawing geometries of the two forms as given below from which it is clear that in the _trans_-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups are in opposite directions, Threfore, dipole moments of C-CH3 bonds cancel, thus making the _trans_ form non-polar.

#### Structure of Triple Bond

Ethyne is the simplest molecule of alkyne series. Structure of ethyne is shown in Fig. 13.6.

Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (\(\phi\)) bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping of the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised orbital of each carbon atom undergoes overlapping along the internuclear axis with the 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen atoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. H-C-C bond angle is of 180deg. Each carbon has two unhybridised p orbitals which are perpendicular to each other as well as to the plane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2\(p\) orbitals of one carbon atom are parallel to the 2\(p\) orbitals of the other carbon atom, which undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to form two pi (\(\pi\)) bonds between two carbon atoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one C-C \(\sigma\) bond, two C-H \(\sigma\) bonds and two C-C \(\pi\) bonds. The strength of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 823 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) is more than those of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) and C-C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)). The C=C bond length is shorter(120 pm) than those of C=C (133 pm) and C-C (154 pm). Electron cloud between two carbon atoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear molecule.

#### Preparation

_From calcium carbide:_ On industrial scale, ethyne is prepared by treating calcium carbide with water. Calcium carbide is prepared by heating quick lime with coke. Quick lime can be obtained by heating limestone as shown in the following reactions:

\[\ce{CaCO_{3}\xrightarrow{\Delta}CaO+CO_{2}} \tag{13.55}\]

## 2 From vicinal dihalides:

Vicinal dihalides on treatment with alcoholic potassium hydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation. One molecule of hydrogen halide is eliminated to form alkenyl halide which on treatment with sodamide gives alkyne.

#### 13.4.4 Properties

_Physical properties_

Physical properties of alkynes follow the same trend of alkenes and alkanes. First three members are gases, the next eight are liquids and the higher ones are solids. All alkynes are colourless. Ethyene has characteristic odour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes are weakly polar in nature. They are lighter than water and immiscible with water but soluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon tetrachloride and benzene. Their melting point, boiling point and density increase with increase in molar mass.

_Chemical properties_

Alkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions and poly merisation reactions as follows :

### Acidic character of alkyne:

Sodium metal and sodamide (NaNH2) are strong bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen gas. These reactions have not been observed in case of ethene and ethane thus indicating that ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison to ethene and ethane. Why is it so? Has it something to do with their structures and the hybridisation? You have read that hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to the \(sp\) hybridised carbon atoms whereas they are attached to \(sp^{2}\) hybridised carbon atoms in ethene and \(sp^{3}\) hybridised carbons in ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of s character (50%), the \(sp\) hybridised orbitals of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have highest electronegativity; hence, these attract the shared electron pair of the C-H bond of ethyne to a greater extent than that of the \(sp^{2}\) hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene and the \(sp^{3}\) hybridised orbital of carbon in ethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms can be liberated as protons more easily as compared to ethene and ethane. Hence, hydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply bonded carbon are acidic in nature. You may note that the hydrogen atoms attached to the triply bonded carbons are acidic but not all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes.

_Friedrich August Kekule.a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmstadt in Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865. he found an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described the discovery of benzene structure later as:_

_I was sitting writing at my text book, but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere.I turned my chair to the fire. and dozed. Again the atoms were gambling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye. rendered more acute by repeated visions of this kind. could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformations; long rows.sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What was that?One of the snakes had seized hold of it's own tail, and the form whitted mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke:.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen. and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.? 1890)._

_One hundred years later on the occasion of Kekule's centenary celebrations a group of compounds having polyphenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes._

**13.5.2 Structure of Benzene**

Benzene was isolated by Michael Faraday in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\), indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This molecular formula did not account for its relationship to corresponding alkanes, alkenes and a lkynes which you have studied in earlier sections of this unit. What do you think about its possible structure? Due to its unique properties and unusual stability, it took several years to assign its structure. Benzene was found to be a stable molecule and found to form a triozonide which indicates the presence of three double bonds. Benzene was further found to produce one and only one monosubstituted derivative which indicated that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms of benzene are identical. On the basis of this observation August Kekul\(\acute{e}\) in 1865 proposed the following structure for benzene having cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with alternate single and double bonds and one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.

**The Kekul\(\acute{e}\) structure indicates the possibility of two isomeric 1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers, the bromine atoms are attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the other, they are attached to the singly bonded carbons.**However, benzene was found to form only one ortho disubstituted product. This problem was overcome by Kekul\(\acute{e}\) by suggesting the concept of oscillating nature of double bonds in benzene as given below.

Even with this modification, Kekul\(\acute{e}\) structure of benzene fails to explain unusual stability and preference to substitution reactions than addition reactions, which could later on be explained by resonance.

_Resonance and stability of benzene_

According to Valence Bond Theory, the concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a hybrid of various resonating structures. The two structures. A and B given by Kekul\(\acute{e}\) are the main contributing structures. The hybrid structure is represented by inserting a circle or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown in (C). The circle represents the six electrons which are delocalised between the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring.

The orbital overlapping gives us better picture about the structure of benzene. All the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp\({}^{2}\) hybridized. Two sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom overlap with sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C--C sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal plane. The remaining sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of each carbon atom overlaps with orbital of a hydrogen atom to form six C--H sigma bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one unhybridised \(p\) orbital perpendicular to the plane of the ring as shown below:

The unhybridised \(p\) orbital of carbon atoms are close enough to form a \(\pi\) bond by lateral overlap. There are two equal possibilities of forming three \(\pi\) bonds by overlap of \(p\) orbitals of C\({}_{1}\)-C\({}_{2}\), C\({}_{3}\) - C\({}_{4}\), C\({}_{5}\) - C\({}_{6}\) or C\({}_{2}\) - C\({}_{3}\), C\({}_{4}\) - C\({}_{5}\), C\({}_{6}\) - C\({}_{1}\) respectively as shown in the following figures.

**Fig. 13.7** (a)**

Structures shown in Fig. 13.7(a) and (b) correspond to two Kekul\(\acute{e}\)'s structure with localised \(\pi\) bonds. The internuclear distance

Sigma complex or arenium ion loses its aromatic character because delocalisation of electrons stops at \(sp^{3}\) hybridised carbon.

**(c) Removal of proton:** To restore the aromatic character, \(\sigma\) -complex releases proton from \(sp^{3}\) hybridised carbon on attack by [AlCl\({}_{4}\)]"(in case of halogenation, alkylation and acylation) and [HSO\({}_{4}\)]"(in case of nitration).

_Addition reactions_

**Under vigorous conditions**, \(i.e.\), at high temperature and/ or pressure in the presence of nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane.

Under ultra-violet light, three chlorine molecules add to benzene to produce benzene hexachloride, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)Cl\({}_{6}\) which is also called gammaaxane.

(13.81)

_Combustion:_ When heated in air, benzene burns with sooty flame producing CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O

\[\begin{array}{l}{\rm C_{6}H_{6}+\frac{15}{2}O_{2}\to 6CO_{2}+3H_{2}O}\end{array} \tag{13.82}\]

General combustion reaction for any hydrocarbon may be given by the following chemical equation:

\[\begin{array}{l}{\rm C_{x}H_{y}+(x+\frac{y}{4})O_{2}\to xCO_{2}+\frac{y}{2} H_{2}O}\end{array} \tag{13.83}\]

#### 13.5.6 Directive influence of functional group in monosubstituted benzene

When monosubstituted benzene is subjected to further substitution, three possible disubstituted products are not formed in equal amounts. Two types of behaviour are observed. Either \(ortho\)\(and\)\(para\) products or \(meta\) product are predominantly formed. It has also been observed that it has behaviour depends on the nature of the substituent already present in the benzene ring and not on the nature of the entering group. This is known as directive influence of substituents. Reasons for \(ortho\)/ \(para\)\(or\)\(meta\) directive nature of groups are discussed below:

_Ortho and para directing groups:_ The groups which direct the incoming group to \(ortho\) and \(para\) positions are called \(ortho\) and \(para\) directing groups. As an example, let us discuss the directive influence of phenolic (-OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of following structures:

It is clear from the above resonating structures that the electron density is more on \(o-\) and \(p-\)positions. Hence, the substitution takes place mainly at these positions. However, it may be noted that -I effect of - OH group also operates due to which the electron density on \(ortho\) and \(para\) positions of the benzene ring is slightly reduced. But the overall electron density increases at these positions of the ring due to resonance. Therefore, -OH group **activates** the benzene ring for the attack by an electrophile. Other examples of **activating** groups are -NH\({}_{2}\), -NHR, -NHCOCH\({}_{3}\), -OCH\({}_{3}\), -CH\({}_{3}\), -CH\({}_{3}\), -C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\), etc.

In the case of aryl halides, halogens are moderately **deactivating**. Because of their strong - I effect, overall electron density on benzene ring decreases. It makes further substitution difficult. However, due to resonance the electron density on _o_- and _p_-positions is greater than that at the _m_-position. Hence, they are also _o_- and _p_- directing groups.

_Meta directing group:_ The _groups_ which direct the incoming group to _meta_ position are called _meta_ directing groups. Some examples of _meta_ directing groups are -NO\({}_{2}\), -CN, -CHO, -COR, -COOH, -COOR, -SO\({}_{3}\)H, etc.

Let us take the example of nitro group. Nitro group reduces the electron density in the benzene ring due to its strong-I effect. Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the following structures.

In this case, the overall electron density on benzene ring decreases making further substitution difficult, therefore these groups are also called '**deactivating groups**'. The electron density on _o_- and _p_- position is comparatively less than that at _meta_ position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on comparatively electron rich _meta_ position resulting in _meta_ substitution.

### CARCINOGENICITY AND TOXICITY

Benzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons containing more than two benzene rings fused together are toxic and said to possess cancer producing (carcinogenic) property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons are formed on incomplete combustion of organic materials like tobacco, coal and petroleum. They enter into human body and undergo various biochemical reactions and finally damage DNA and cause cancer. Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are given below (see box).

In this case, the overall electron density on benzene ring decreases making further substitution difficult, therefore these groups

## Chapter 14 Environmental Chemistry

pollutants cannot be degraded by natural processes and are harmful to living organisms. In the process of environmental pollution, pollutants originate from a source and get transported by air or water or are dumped into the soil by human beings.

### ATMOSPHERIC POLUTION

The atmosphere that surrounds the earth is not of the same thickness at all heights. There are concentric layers of air or regions and each layer has different density. The lowest region of atmosphere in which the human beings along with other organisms live is called **troposphere**. It extends up to the height of - 10 km from sea level. Above the troposphere, between 10 and 50 km above sea level lies **stratosphere**. Troposphere is a turbulent, dusty zone containing air, much water vapour and clouds. This is the region of strong air movement and cloud formation. The stratosphere, on the other hand, contains dinitrogen, dioxygen, ozone and little water vapour.

Atmospheric pollution is generally studied as tropospheric and stratospheric pollution. The presence of ozone in the stratosphere prevents about 99.5 per cent of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiations from reaching the earth's surface and thereby protecting humans and other animals from its effect.

### 14.2.1 Tropospheric Pollution

Tropospheric pollution occurs due to the presence of undesirable solid or gaseous particles in the air. The following are the major gaseous and particulate pollutants present in the troposphere:

1. Gaseous air pollutants: These are oxides of sulphur, nitrogen and carbon, hydrogen sulphide, hydrocarbons, ozone and other oxidants.
2. Particulate pollutants: These are dust, mist, fumes, smoke, smog etc.

_1. Gaseous air pollutants_

_(a) Oxides of sulphur_: Oxides of sulphur are produced when sulphur containing fossil fuel is burnt. The most common species, sulphur dioxide, is a gas that is poisonous to both animals and plants. It has been reported that even a low concentration of sulphur dioxide causes respiratory diseases e.g., asthma, bronchitis, emphysema in human beings. Suphur dioxide causes irritation to the eyes, resulting in tears and redness. High concentration of SO2 leads to stiffness of flower buds which eventually fall off from plants. Uncatalysed oxidation of sulphur dioxide is slow. However, the presence of particulate matter in polluted air catalyses the oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide.

2SO2 (g) +O2 (g) 2SO3(g)

The reaction can also be promoted by ozone and hydrogen peroxide.

SO2 (g) +O3 (g) -SO3(g) +O2 (g)

SO2(g) +H2O2(l) -H2SO4(aq)

_(b) Oxides of Nitrogen:_: Dini trogen and dioxygen are the main constituents of air. These gases do not react with each other at a normal temperature. At high altitudes when lightning strikes, they combine to form oxides of nitrogen. NO2 is oxidised to nitrate ion, NO2 which is washed into soil, where it serves as a fertilizer. In an automobile engine, (at high temperature) when fossil fuel is burnt, dini trogen and dioxygen combine to yield significant quantities of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as given below:

NO reacts instantly with oxygen to give NO2

2NO (g) +O2 (g) 2NO2(g)

Rate of production of NO2 is faster when nitric oxide reacts with ozone in the stratosphere.

NO (g) +O3 (g) -NO2 (g) +O2 (g)

The irritant red haze in the traffic and congested places is due to oxides of nitrogen. Higher concentrations of NO2 damage the leaves of plants and retard the rate of photosynthesis. Nitrogen dioxide is a lung irritant that can lead to an acute respiratory disease in children. It is toxic to living tissues also. Nitrogen dioxide is also harmful to various textile fibres and metals.

400

_(c) Hydrocarbons:_Hydrocarbons are composed of hydrogen and carbon only and are formed by incomplete combustion of fuel used in automobiles. Hydrocarbons are carcinogenic, _i.e._, they cause cancer. They harm plants by causing ageing, breakdown of tissues and shedding of leaves, flowers and twigs.

_(d) Oxides of Carbon_

_(i) Carbon monoxide:_Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most serious air pollutants. It is a colourless and odourless gas. highly poisonous to living beings because of its ability to block the delivery of oxygen to the organs and tissues. It is produced as a result of incomplete combustion of carbon. Carbon monoxide is mainly released into the air by automobile exhaust. Other sources, which produce CO, involve incomplete combustion of coal, firewood, petrol, etc. The number of vehicles has been increasing over the years all over the world. Many vehicles are poorly maintained and several have inadequate pollution control equipments resulting in the release of greater amount of carbon monoxide and other polluting gases. Do you know why carbon monoxide is poisonous? It binds to haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin, which is about 300 times more stable than the oxygen-haemoglobin complex. In blood, when the concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin reaches about 3-4 per cent, the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is greatly reduced. This oxygen deficiency, results into headache, weak eyesight, nervousness and cardiovascular disorder. This is the reason why people are advised not to smoke. In pregnant women who have the habit of smoking the increased CO level in blood may induce premature birth, spontaneous abortions and deformed babies.

_(ii) Carbon dioxide:_Carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere by respiration, burning of fossil fuels for energy, and by decomposition of limestone during the manufacture of cement. It is also emitted during volcanic eruptions. Carbon dioxide gas is confined to troposphere only. Normally it forms about 0.03 per cent by volume of the atmosphere. With the increased use of fossil fuels, a large amount of carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere. Excess of CO2 in the air is removed by green plants and this maintains an appropriate level of CO2 in the atmosphere. Green plants require CO2 for photosynthesis and they, in turn, emit oxygen, thus maintaining the delicate balance. As you know, deforestation and burning of fossil fuel increases the CO2 level and disturb the balance in the atmosphere. The increased amount of CO2 in the air is mainly responsible for global warming.

_Global Warming and Greenhouse Effect_

About 75 % of the solar energy reaching the earth is absorbed by the earth's surface, which increases its temperature. The rest of the heat radiates back to the atmosphere. Some of the heat is trapped by gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, chlorofluorocarbon compounds (CFCs) and water vapour in the atmosphere. Thus, they add to the heating of the atmosphere. This causes global warming.

We all know that in cold places flowers, vegetables and fruits are grown in glass covered areas called greenhouse. Do you know that we humans also live in a greenhouse? Of course, we are not surrounded by glass but a blanket of air called the atmosphere, which has kept the temperature on earth constant for centuries. But it is now undergoing change, thoughs slowly. Just as the glass in a greenhouse holds the sun's warmth inside, atmosphere traps the sun's heat near the earth's surface and keeps it warm. This is called _natural greenhouse effect_ because it maintains the temperature and makes the earth perfect for life. In a greenhouse, vis ble light passes through the transparent glass and heats up the soil and the plants. The warm soil and plants emit infrared radiations. Since glass is opaque to infrared (heat) radiations, it partly reflects and partly absorbs these radiations. This mechanism keeps the energy of the sun trapped in the greenhouse. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules also trap heat as they are transparent to sunlight but not to the heat radiation. If the amount of carbon dioxide crosses the delicate proportion of 0.03 per cent, the natural greenhouse balance may get disturbed. Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to global warming.

Besides carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases are methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide, CFCs and ozone. Methane is produced naturally when vegetation is burnt, digested or rotated in the absence of oxygen. Large amounts of methane are released in paddy fields, coal mines, from rotting garbage dumps and by fossil fuels. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are man-made industrial chemicals used in air conditioning etc. CFCs are also damaging the ozone layer (Section 14.2.2). Nitro oxide occurs naturally in the environment. In recent years, their quantities have increased significantly due to the use of chemical fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. If these trends continue, the average global temperature will increase to a level which may lead to melting of polar ice caps and flooding of low lying areas all over the earth. Increase in the global temperature increases the incidence of infectious diseases like dengue. malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness etc.

### 14.1 Think it Over

What can we do to reduce the rate of global warming?

If burning of fossil fuels, cutting down forests and trees add to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we must find ways to use these just efficiently and judiciously. One of the simple things which we can do to reduce global warming is to minimise the use of automobiles. Depending upon the situation, one can use bicycle, public transport system, or go for carpool. We should plant more trees to increase the green cover. Avoid burning of dry leaves, wood etc. It is illegal to smoke in public places and work places, because it is harmful not only for the one who is smoking but also for others, and therefore, we should avoid it. Many people do not understand the greenhouse effect and the global warming. We can help them by sharing the information that we have.

### 14.2 Acid rain

We are aware that normally rain water has a pH of 5.6 due to the presence of H\({}^{+}\) ions formed by the reaction of rain water with carbon

Figure 14.1: Add deposition

dioxide present in the atmosphere.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)+\text{CO}_{2}\left( \text{g}\right)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}\left(\text{aq} \right)\\ \text{H}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}\left(\text{aq}\right)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}^{*} \left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{HCO}_{3}^{*}\left(\text{aq}\right)\end{array}\]

When the pH of the rain water drops below 5.6, it is called acid rain.

Acid rain refers to the ways in which acid from the atmosphere is deposited on the earth's surface. Oxides of nitrogen and sulphur which are acidic in nature can be blown by wind along with solid particles in the atmosphere and finally settle down either on the ground as dry deposition or in water, fog and snow as wet deposition. (Fig. 14.1)

Acid rain is a byproduct of a variety of human activities that emit the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen in the atmosphere. As mentioned earlier, burning of fossil fuels (which contain sulphur and nitrogenous matter) such as coal and oilin power stations and furnaces or petrol and diesel in motor engines produce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. SO\({}_{2}\) and NO\({}_{2}\) after oxidation and reaction with water are major contributors to acid rain, because polluted air usually contains particulate matter that catalyse the oxidation.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{2SO}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{O}_{2}\left( \text{g}\right)+\text{2H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)\to\text{2H}_{2} \text{SO}_{4}\left(\text{aq}\right)\\ \text{4NO}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{2H}_ {2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right)\to\text{4HNO}_{3}\left(\text{aq}\right) \end{array}\]

Ammonium salts are also formed and can be seen as an atmospheric haze (aerosol of fine particles). Aerosol particles of oxides or ammonium salts in rain drops result in wet-deposition. SO\({}_{2}\) is also absorbed directly on both solid and liquid ground surfaces and is thus deposited as dry-deposition.

Acid rain is harmful for agriculture, trees and plants as it dissolves and washes away nutrients needed for their growth. It causes respiratory ailments in human beings and animals. When acid rain falls and flows as ground water to reach rivers, lakes etc. it affects plants and animal life in aquatic ecosystem. It corrodes water pipes resulting in the leaching of heavy metals such as iron, lead and copper into the drinking water. Acid rain damages buildings and other structures made of stone or metal. The Tal Mahal in India has been affected by acid rain.

**Activity 1**

You can collects samples of water from nearby places and record their pH values. Discuss your results in the class. Let us discuss how we can help to reduce the formation of acid rain.

This can be done by reducing the emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. We should use less vehicles driven by fossil fuels; use less sulphur content fossil fuels for power plants and industries. We should use natural gas which is a better fuel than coal or use coal with less sulphur content. Catalytic converters must be used in cars to reduce the effect of exhaust fumes on the atmosphere. The main component of the converter is a ceramic honeycomb coated with precious metals -- Pd, Pt and Rh. The exhaust gases containing unburnt fuel, CO and NO\({}_{x}\), when pass through the converter at 573 K, are converted into CO\({}_{2}\) and N\({}_{x}\). We can also reduce the acidity of the soil by adding powdered limestone to neutralise the acidity of the soil. Many people do not know of acid rain and its harmful effects. We can make them aware by passing on this information and save the Nature.

**Taj Mahal and Acid Rain**

The air around the city of Agra, where the Taj Mahal is located, contains fairly high levels of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. It is mainly due to a large number of industries and power plants around the area. Use of poor quality of coal, kerosene and firewood as fuel for domestic purposes add up to this problem. The resulting acid rain reacts with marble, CaCO\({}_{3}\) of Taj Mahal (CaCO\({}_{3}\) +H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \(\rightarrow\) CaSO\({}_{4}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O+ CO\({}_{2}\)) causing damage to this wonderful monument that has attracted people from around the world. As a result, the monument is being slowly disfigured and the marble is getting discoloured and lustreless. The Government of India announced an action plan in early 1995 to prevent the disfiguring of this historical monument. Mathura refinery has already taken suitable measures to check the emission of toxic gases.

## 2 Particulate Pollutants

Particulates pollutants are the minute solid particles or liquid droplets in air. These are present in vehicle emissions, smoke particles from fires, dust particles and ash from industries. Particulates in the atmosphere may be viable or non-vlab. The viable particulates _e.g._, bacteria, fungi, moulds, algae etc., are minute living organisms that are dispersed in the atmosphere. Human beings are allergic to some of the fungi found in air. They can also cause plant diseases.

Non-viable particulates may be classified according to their nature and size as follows:

1. [label=()]
2. Smoke particulates consist of solid or mixture of solid and liquid particles formed during combustion of organic matter. Examples are cigarette smoke, smoke from burning of fossil fuel, garbage and dry leaves, oil smoke etc.
3. Dust is composed of fine solid particles (over 1\(\upmu\)m in diameter), produced during crushing, grinding and attribution of solid materials. Sand from sand blasting, saw dust from wood works, pulverized coal, cement and fly ash from factories, dust storms etc., are some typical examples of this type of particulate emission.
4. Mists are produced by particles of spray liquids and by condensation of vapours in air. Examples are sulphuric acid mist and herbicides and insecticides that miss their targets and travel through air and form mists.
5. Fumes are generally obtained by the condensation of vapours during sublimation, distillation, boiling and several other chemical reactions. Generally, organic solvents, metals and metallic oxides form fume particles.

The effect of particulate pollutants are largely dependent on the particle size. Airborne particles such as dust, fumes, mist etc., are dangerous for human health. Particulate pollutants bigger than 5 microns are likely to lodge in the nasal passage, whereas particles of about 1.0 micron enter into lungs easily.

Lead used to be a major air pollutant emitted by vehicles. Leaded petrol used to be the primary source of air-borne lead emission in Indian cities. This problem has now been overcome by using unleaded petrol in most of the cities in India. Lead interferes with the development and maturation of red blood cells.

### Smog

The word smog is derived from smoke and fog. This is the most common example of air pollution that occurs in many cities throughout the world. There are two types of smog:

1. [label=()]
2. Classical smog occurs in cool humid climate. It is a mixture of smoke, fog and sulphur dioxide. Chemically it is a reducing mixture and so it is also called as reducing smog.
3. Photochemical smog occurs in warm, dry and sunny climate. The main components of the photochemical smog result from the action of sunlight on unsaturated hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides produced by automobiles and factories. Photochemical smog has high concentration of oxidising agents and is, therefore, called as oxidising smog.

### Formation of photochemical smog

When fossil fuels are burnt, a variety of pollutants are emitted into the earth's

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:385]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:386]

When sunlight returns to the Antarctica in the spring, the sun's warmth breaks up the clouds and HOCI and Cl\({}_{2}\) are photolysed by sunlight, as given in reactions (viii) and (ix).

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{HOCI (g)}\xrightarrow{\text{hv}}\text{O H (g)}+\text{Cl(g)}&\text{(vii)}\\ \text{Cl}_{2}\text{ (g)}\xrightarrow{\text{hv}}2\text{Cl (g)}&\text{(ix)}\end{array}\] (vii)

The chlorine radicals thus formed, initiate the chain reaction for ozone depletion as described earlier.

_Effects of Depletion of the Ozone Layer_

With the depletion of ozone layer, more UV radiation filters into troposphere. UV radiations lead to ageing of skin, cataract, sunburn, skin cancer, killing of many phytoplanktons, damage to fish productivity etc. It has also been reported that plant proteins get easily affected by UV radiations which leads to the harmful mutation of cells. It also increases evaporation of surface water through the stomata of the leaves and decreases the moisture content of the soil. Increase in UV radiations damage paints and fibres, causing them to fade faster.

### Water Pollution

Water is essential for life. Without water there would be no life. We usually take water as granted for its purity, but we must ensure the quality of water. Pollution of water originates from human activities. Through different paths, pollution reaches surface or ground water. Easily identified source or place of pollution is called as point source. e.g., municipal and industrial discharge pipes where pollutants enter the water-source. Non point sources of pollution are those where a source of pollution cannot be easily identified, e.g., agricultural run off (from farm, animals and crop-lands), acid rain, storm-water drainage (from streets. parking lots and laws), etc. Table 14.1 lists the major water pollutants and their sources.

#### 14.3.1 Causes of Water Pollution

_(i) Pathogens_: The most serious water pollutants are the disease causing agents called pathogens. Pathogens include bacteria and other organisms that enter water from domestic sewage and animal excreta. Human excreta contain bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ and _Streptococcus faecalis_ which cause gastrointestinal diseases.

_(ii) Organic wastes_: The other major water pollutant is organic matters such as leaves. grass. trash etc. They pollute water as a consequence of run off. Excessive phytoplankton growth within water is also a cause of water pollution. These wastes are biodegradable.

The large population of bacteria decomposes organic matter present in water. They consume oxygen dissolve in water. The amount of oxygen that water can hold in the solution is limited. In cold water, dissolved oxygen (DO) can reach a concentration up to 10 ppm (parts per million), whereas oxygen in air is about 200,000 ppm. That is why even a moderate amount of organic matter when decomposes in water can deplete the water of its dissolved oxygen. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is very important for aquatic life. If the concentration of dissolved oxygen of water is below 6 ppm, the growth of fish gets inhibited. Oxygen reaches water either through atmosphere or from the process of photosynthesis carried out by many aquatic green plants during day light. However, during night, photosynthesis stops but the plants continue to respire, resulting in reduction of dissolved oxygen. The dissolved oxygen is also used by microorganisms to oxidise organic matter.

If too much of organic matter is added to water, all the available oxygen is used up. This causes oxygen dependent aquatic life to die. Thus, anaerobic bacteria (which do not require oxygen) begin to break down the organic waste and produce chemicals that have a foul smell and are harmful to human health. Aerobic (oxygen requiring) bacteria degrade these organic wastes and keep the water depleted in dissolved oxygen.

Thus, the amount of oxygen required by bacteria to break down the organic matter present in a certain volume of a sample of water, is called **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**. The amount of BOD in the water is a measure of the amount of organic material in the water, in terms of how much oxygen will be required to break it down biologically. Clean water would have BOD value of less than 5 ppm whereas highly polluted water could have a BOD value of 17 ppm or more.

_(iii) Chemical Pollutants:_ As we know that water is an excellent solvent, water soluble inorganic chemicals that include heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, nickel etc constitute an important class of pollutants. All these metals are dangerous to humans because our body cannot excrete them. Over the time, it crosses the tolerance limit. These metals then can damage kidneys, central nervous system, liver etc. Acids (like sulphuric acid) from mine drainage and salts from many different sources including raw salt used to melt snow and ice in the colder climates (sodium and calcium chloride) are water soluble chemical pollutants.

The organic chemicals are another group of substances that are found in polluted water. Petroleum products pollute many sources of water e.g., major oil spills in oceans. Other organic substances with serious impacts are the pesticides that drift down from sprays or runoff from lands. Various industrial chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls, (PCBs) which are used as cleansing solvent, detergents and fertilizers add to the list of water pollutants. PCBs are suspected to be carcinogenic. Nowadays most of the detergents available are biodegradable. However, theiruse can create other problems. The bacteria responsible for degrading biodegradable detergent feed on it and grow rapidly. While growing, they may use up all the oxygen dissolved in water. The lack of oxygen kills all other forms of aquatic life such as fish and plants. Fertilizers contain phosphates as additives. The addition of phosphates in water enhances algae growth. Such profuse growth of algae, covers the water surface and reduces the oxygen concentration in water. This leads to anaerobic conditions, commonly with accumulation of abnoxious decay and animal death. Thus, bloom-infested water inhibits the growth of other living organisms in the water body. This process in which nutrient enriched water bodies support a dense plant population, which kills animal life by depriving it of oxygen and results in subsequent loss of biodiversity is known as _Eutrophication._

#### 14.3.2 International Standards for Drinking Water

The International Standards for drinking water are given below and they must be followed.

_Fluoride:_ For drinking purposes, water should be tested for fluoride ion concentration. Its deficiency in drinking water is harmful to man and causes diseases such as tooth decay etc. Soluble fluoride is often added to drinking water to bring its concentration upto 1 ppm or 1 mg dm-3. The F-ions make the enamel on teeth much harder by converting hydroxyapatite, [3(Ca3(PO4)2,Ca(OH)2], the enamel on the surface of the teeth, into much harder fluorapatite, [3(Ca3(PO4)2,CaF2)],However, F' ion concentration above 2 ppm causes brown mottling of teeth. At the same time, excess fluoride (over 10 ppm) causes harmful effect to bones and teeth, as reported from some parts of Rajasthan.

_Lead:_ Drinking water gets contaminated with lead when leadpipes areused for transportation of water. The prescribed upper limit concentration of lead in drinking water is about 50 ppb. Lead can damage kidney, liver, reproduce system etc.

_Subplate:_ Excessive sulphate (>500 ppm) in drinking water causes laxative effect, otherwise at moderate levels it is harmless.

_Nitrate:_ The maximum limit of nitrate in drinking water is 50 ppm. Excess nitrate in drinking water can cause disease such as methemoglobin('blue baby' syndrome).

_Other metals:_ The maximum concentration of some common metals recommended in drinking water are given in Table 14.2.

**Activity 2**

You can visit local water sources and observe if the river/lake/tank/pond are unpolluted/slightly polluted/ moderately polluted or severely polluted by looking at water or by checking pH of water. Document the name of the river and the nearby urban or industrial site from where the pollution is generated. Inform about this to Pollution Control Board's office set up by Government to measure

**pollution levels.** Ensure that appropriate action is taken. You can write to the press also. Donot dump waste into a household or industrial drain which can enter directly to any water body, such as, river, pond, stream or lake. Use compost instead of chemical fertilizers in gardens. Avoid the use of pesticides like DDT, malathion etc.. at home and try to use dried neem leaves to help keep insects away. Add a few crystals of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or bleaching powder to the water tank of your house.

### Soil Pollution

India being an agriculture based economy gives high priority to agriculture, fisheries and livestock development. The surplus production is stored by governmental and non-governmental organisations for the lean season. The food loss during the storage also needs special attention. Have you ever seen the damages caused to the crops, food items by insects, rodents, weeds and crop diseases etc? How can we protect them? You are acquainted with some insecticides and pesticides for protection of our crops. However, these insecticides, pesticides and herbicides cause soil pollution. Hence, there is a need for their judicious use.

### Pesticides

Prior to World War II, many naturally occurring chemicals such as nicotine (by planting tobacco plants in the crop field), were used as pest controlling substance for major crops in agricultural practices.

During World War II, DDT was found to be of great use in the control of malaria and other insect-borne diseases. Therefore, after the war, DDT was put to use in agriculture to control the damages caused by insects, rodents, weeds and various crop diseases. However, due to adverse effects, its use has been banned in India.

Pesticides are basically synthetic toxic chemicals with ecological repercussions. The repeated use of the same or similar pesticides give rise to pests that are resistant to that group of pesticides thus making the pesticides ineffective. Therefore, as insect resistance of DDT increased, other organic toxins such as Aldrin and Dieldrin were introduced in the market by pesticide industry. Most of the organic toxins are water insoluble and non-biodegradable. These high persistent toxins are, therefore, transferred from lower trophic level to higher trophic level through food chain (Fig. 14.3). Over the time, the concentration of toxins in higher animals reach a level which causes serious metabolic and physiological disorders.

In response to high persistence of chlorinated organic toxins, a new series of less persistent or more bio-degradable products called organo-phosphates and carbamates have been introduced in the market. But these chemicals are severe nerve toxins and hence more harmful to humans. As a result, there are reports of some pesticides related deaths of agricultural field workers. Insects have become resistant to these insecticides also. The insecticide industry is engaged in developing new groups of insecticides. But one has to think, is this the only solution to pest menace?

These days, the pesticide industry has shifted its attention to **herbicides** such as sodium chlorate (NaClO\({}_{3}\)), sodium arsenite (Na\({}_{3}\)AsO\({}_{3}\)) and many others. During the first half of the last century, the shift from mechanical to chemical weed control had provided the industry with flourishing economic market. But one must remember that these are also not environment friendly.

Most herbicides are toxic to mammals but are not as persistent as organo-chlorides. These chemicals decompose in a few months. Like organo-chlorides, these too become concentrated in the food web. Some herbicides cause birth defects. Studies show that corn-fields sprayed with herbicides are more prone to insect attack and plant disease than fields that are weeded manually.

Pesticides and herbicides represent only a very small portion of widespread chemical pollution. A large number of other compounds that are used regularly in chemical and industrial processes for manufacturing activities are finally released in the atmosphere in one or other form.

### INDUSTRIAL WASTE

Industrial solid wastes are also sorted out as biodegradable and non-degradable wastes. Biodegradable wastes are generated by cotton mills, food processing units. paper mills, and textile factories.

Non-biodegradable wastes are generated by thermal power plants which produce fly ash: integrated iron and steel plants which produce blast furnace slag and steel melting slag. Industries manufacturing aluminium, zinc and copper produce mud and tailings. Fertillizer industries produce gypsum. Hazardous wastes such as inflammables, composite explosives or highly reactive substances are produced by industries dealing in metals, chemicals, drugs, pharmaceuticals, dyes, pesticides, rubber goods etc.

The disposal of non-degradable industrial solid wastes, if not done by a proper and suitable method, may cause serious threat to the environment. New innovations have led to different uses of waste material. Nowadays, fly ash and slag from the steel industry are utilised by the cement industry. Large

Figure 14.3: At each trophic level, the pollutant gets 10 times concentrated.

quantitites of toxic wastes are usually destroyed by controlled incineration, whereas small quantities are burnt along with factory garbage in open bins. Moreover, solid wastes if not managed effectively, affect the components of the environment.

**Do you know about waste recycling?**

* Fuel obtained from plastic waste has high octane rating. It contains no lead and is known as "green fuel".
* Due to recent developments made in chemical and textile industries, clothes will be made from recycled plastic waste. These will be available soon in the global textile market.
* In India, our cities and towns face endless hours of power cut. We can also see piles of rotting garbage here and there. There is a good news that we can get rid from both these problems simultaneously. Technology has now been developed to produce electricity from the garbage. A pilot plant has been set up, where after removing ferrous metals, plastic, glass, paper etc. from garbage, it is mixed with water. It is then cultured with bacterial species for producing methane, commonly known as biogas. The remaining product is used as manure and biogas is used to produce electricity.

### STRATEGIES TO CONTROL ENVIRONMENT POLLUITION

After studying air, water, soil and industrial waste pollution in this unit, by now you must have started feeling the need of controlling environmental pollution: How can you save your immediate environment? Think of the steps/activities, which you would like to undertake for controlling air, water, soil and industrial waste pollution in your neighbourhood. Here, an idea about the strategies for the management of waste is given.

### Waste Management

Solid waste is not the only waste, which you see in your household garbage box. Besides household discards, there are medical, agricultural, industrial and mining wastes. The improper disposal of wastes is one of the major causes of environmental degradation. Therefore, the management of wastes is of utmost importance.

_Collection and Disposal_

Domestic wastes are collected in small bins, which are then transferred to community bins by private or municipal workers. From these community bins, these are collected and carried to the disposable site. At the site, garbage is sorted out and separated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials. Non-biodegradable materials such as plastic, glass, metal scraps etc. are sent for recycling. Biodegradable wastes are deposited in land fills and are converted into compost.

The waste if not collected in garbage bins, finds its way into the sewers. Some of it is eaten by cattle. Non-biodegradable wastes like polythene bag, metal scraps, etc. choke the sewers and cause inconvenience. Polythene bags, if swallowed by cattle can cost their lives also.

As a normal practice, therefore, all domestic wastes should be properly collected and disposed. The poor management causes health problems leading to epidemics due to contamination of ground water. It is specially hazardous for those who are in direct contact with the waste such as rag pickers and workers involved in waste disposal, as they are the ones who handle waste materials mostly without protective device such as gloves or water proof boots and gas masks. What can you do for them?

### GREEN CHEMISTRY

#### Introduction

It is well known fact that self-sufficiency in food has been achieved in India since late 20\({}^{\text{th}}\) century by using fertilizers and pesticides and exploring improved methods of farming, good quality seeds, irrigation etc. But over-exploitation of soil and excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides have resulted in the deterioration of soil, water and air.

The solution of this problem does not lie in stopping the process of development that has been set in; but to discover methods, which would help in the reduction of deterioration of the environment. _Green chemistry is a way of thinking and is about utilising the existing knowledge and principles of chemistry and other sciences to reduce the adverse impact on environment. Green chemistry is a production process that would bring about minimum pollution or deterioration to the environment. The byproducts generated during a process, if not used gainfully, add to the environmental pollution. Such processes are not only environmental unfriendly but also cost-ineffective. The waste generation and its disposal both are economically unsound. Utilisation of existing knowledge base for reducing the chemical hazards along with the developmental activities is the foundation of green chemistry._ Have you perceived the idea of green chemistry? It is well known that organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, carbon tetrachloride etc., are highly toxic. One should be careful while using them.

As you know, a chemical reaction involves reactants, attacking reagents and the medium in which the reaction takes place. Extent of any reaction depends upon physical parameters like temperature, pressure and use of catalyst. In a chemical reaction, if reactants are fully converted into useful environmental friendly products by using an environment friendly medium then there would be no chemical pollutants introduced in the environment.

During a synthesis, care must be taken to choose starting materials that can be converted into end products with yield approximately upto 100 per cent. This can be achieved by arriving at optimum conditions of synthesis. It may be worthwhile to carry out synthetic reactions in aqueous medium since water has high specific heat and low volatility. Water is cost effective, noninflammable and devoid of any carcinogenic effects.

### Green Chemistry in day-to-day Life

_(i) Dry Cleaning of Clothes_

Tetra chlororetiene (Cl\({}_{2}\)C=CCL\({}_{2}\)) was earlier used as solvent for dry cleaning. The compound contaminates the ground water and is also a suspected carcinogen. The process using this compound is now being replaced by a process, where liquefied carbondioxide, with a suitable detergent is used. Replacement of halogenated solvent by liquid CO\({}_{2}\) will result in less harm to ground water.

These days hydrogen peroxide (H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) is used for the purpose of bleaching clothes in the process of laundary, which gives better results and makes use of lesser amount of water.

_(ii) Bleaching of Paper_

Chlorine gas was used earlier for bleaching paper. These days, hydrogen peroxide (H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) with suitable catalyst, which promotes the bleaching action of hydrogen peroxide, is used.

_(iii) Synthesis of Chemicals_

Ethanal (CH\({}_{3}\)CHO) is now commercially prepared by one step oxidation of ethene in the presence of ionic catalyst in aqueous medium with an yield of 90%.

\(\mathrm{CH_{2}=CH_{2}+O_{2}\frac{Catalyst}{Pol\,III/Cu\,II\,III\,water}}\)

\(\mathrm{CH_{3}CHO(90\%)}\)

Green chemistry, in a nutshell, is a cost effective approach which involves reduction in material, energy consumption and waste generation.

### Think it Over

What is our responsibility as a human being to protect our environment?

Some concepts, if followed by an individual, contribute towards a better quality of our environment and human life. Always set up a compost tin in your garden or any other place in your home and use it to produce manure for your plants to reduce the use of fertilizers. Use a cloth bag and avoid asking for plastic carry bags when you buy groceries, vegetables or any other item. See that all newspapers, glass, aluminum and other items in your area are recycled. We might have to take little trouble to locate such dealers. We must realize that we do not have solutions for every problem but we can concentrate on issues, which we feel strongly about and can do some thing about. We should take care to put into practice whatever we preach. Always remember environment protection begins with us.

## Summary

Environmental chemistry plays a major role in environment. Chemical species present in the environment are either naturally occurring or generated by human activities. Environmental pollution is the effect of undesirable changes in the surrounding that have harmful effects on plants, animals and human beings. Pollutants exist in all the three states of matter. We have discussed only those pollutants, which are due to human activities, and can be controlled. Atmospheric pollution is generally studied as tropospheric and stratospheric pollution. Troposphere is the lowest region of the atmosphere (~10 km) in which man along with other organisms including plants exist. Whereas stratosphere extends above troposphere up to 50 km above sea level. Ozone layer is one of the important constituents of stratosphere. Tropospheric pollution is basically due to various oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, halogens and also due to particulate pollutants. The gaseous pollutants come down to the earth in the form of acid rain. 75% of the solar energy reaching earth is absorbed by the earth surface and rest is radiated back to the atmosphere. These gases mentioned above trap the heat which result into global warming. It is important to realise that these very gases are also responsible for the life on the earth as they trap the requisite amount of solarenergy for the sustainance of life. The increase in the greenhouse gases is raising the temperature of the earth's atmosphere which, if not checked, may eventually result in melting of polar ice caps and consequently may submerge the costal land mass. Many human activities are producing chemicals, which are responsible for the **depletion of ozone layer** in the stratosphere, leading to the formation of **ozone hole**. Through the ozone hole, ultraviolet radiations can penetrate into the earth's atmosphere causing mutation of genes. Water is the elixir of life but the same water, if polluted by pathogens, organic wastes, toxic heavy metals, pesticides etc., will turn into poison. Therefore, one should take care to follow international standards to maintain purity levels of drinking water. Industrial wastes and excessive use of pesticides, result into pollution of land mass and water bodies. Judicious use of chemicals required for agricultural practices can lead to sustainable development. **Strategies for controlling environmental pollution** can be: (i) waste management _ie._, reduction of the waste and proper disposal, also recycling of materials and energy, (ii) adopting methods in day-to-day life, which results in the reduction of environmental pollution. The second method is a new branch of chemistry, which is in its infancy known as **green chemistry**. It utilizes the existing knowledge and practices so as to bring about reduction in the production of pollutants.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to describe general characteristics of solid state:

* distinguish between amorphous and crystalline solids:
* classify crystalline solids on the basis of the nature of binding forces:
* define crystal lattice and unit cell:
* explain close packing of particles:
* describe different types of voids and close packed structures:
* calculate the packing efficiency of different types of cubic unit cells:
* correlate the density of a substance with its unit cell properties:
* describe the imperfections in solids and their effect on properties:
* correlate the electrical and magnetic properties of solids and their structure.

The vast majority of solid substances like high temperature superconductors, biocorpat@be.pustiss, s@conchps, etc. are destined to play an ever expanding role infuture development of science.

We are mostly surrounded by solids and we use them more often than liquids and gases. For different applications we need solids with widely different properties. These properties depend upon the nature of constituent particles and the binding forces operating between them. Therefore, study of the structure of solids is important. The correlation between structure and properties helps in discovering new solid materials with desired properties like high temperature superconductors, magnetic materials, biodegradable polymers for packaging, biocomplant solids for surgical implants, etc.

From our earlier studies, we know that liquids and gases are called _fluids_ because of their ability to flow. The fluidity in both of these states is due to the fact that the molecules are free to move about. On the contrary, the constituent particles in solids have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions. This explains the rigidity in solids. In crystalline solids, the constituent particles are arranged in regular patterns.

In this Unit, we shall discuss different possible arrangements of particles resulting in several types of structures. The correlation between the nature of interactions within the constituent particles and several properties of solids will also be explored. How these properties get modified due to the structural imperfections or by the presence of impurities in minute amounts would also be discussed.

In Class X you have learnt that matter can exist in three states namely, solid, liquid and gas. Under a given set of conditions of temperature and pressure, which of these would be the most stable state of a given substance depends upon the net effect of two opposing factors. Intermolecular forces tend to keep the molecules (or atoms or ions) closer, whereas thermal energy tends to keep them apart by making them move faster. At sufficiently low temperature, the thermal energy is low and intermolecular forces bring them so close that they cling to one another and occupy fixed positions. These can still oscillate about their mean positions and the substance exists in solid state. The following are the characteristic properties of the solid state:

(i) They have definite mass, volume and shape.

(ii) Intermolecular distances are short.

(iii) Intermolecular forces are strong.

(iv) Their constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions.

(v) They are incompressible and rigid.

12 Amorphous Solids can be classified as _crystalline_ or _amorphous_ on the basis of the nature of order present in the arrangement of their constituent particles. Solids

A crystalline solid usually consists of a large number of small crystals, each of them having a definite characteristic geometrical shape. In a crystal, the arrangement of constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) is ordered. It has long range order which means that there is a regular pattern of arrangement of particles which repeats itself periodically over the entire crystal. Sodium chloride and quartz are typical examples of crystalline solids. An amorphous solid (Greek _amorphous_ = no form) consists of particles of irregular shape. The arrangement of constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) in such a solid has only _short range order_. In such an arrangement, a regular and periodically repeating pattern is observed over short distances only. Such portions are scattered and in between the arrangement is disordered. The structures of quartz (crystalline) and quartz glass (amorphous) are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) respectively. While the two structures are almost identical, yet in the case of amorphous quartz glass there is no _long range order_. The structure of amorphous solids is similar to that of liquids. Glass, rubber and plastics are typical examples of amorphous solids. Due to the differences in the arrangement of the constituent particles, the two types of solids differ in their properties.

Figure 1: Two dimensional structure of (a) quartz and (b) quartz glass

Crystalline solids have a sharp melting point. On the other hand, amorphous solids soften over a range of temperature and can be moulded and blown into various shapes. On heating they become crystalline at some temperature. Some glass objects from ancient civilisations are found to become milky in appearance because of some crystallisation. Like liquids, amorphous solids have a tendency to flow, though very slowly. Therefore, sometimes these are called _pseudo solids_ or _super cooled liquids_. Glass pares fixed to windows or doors of old buildings are invariably found to be slightly thicker at the bottom than at the top. This is because the glass flows down very slowly and makes the bottom portion slightly thicker.

Crystalline solids are _anisotropic_ in nature, that is, some of the physical properties like electrical resistance or refractive index show different values when measure along different directions in the same crystals. This arises from different arrangement of particles in different directions. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.2. Since the arrangement of particles is different along different directions, the value of same physical property is found to be different along each direction.

Amorphous solids on the other hand are _isotropic_ in nature. It is because there is no _long range_ order in them and arrangement is irregular along all the directions. Therefore, value of any physical property would be same along any direction. These differences are summarised in Table 1.1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Property & Operating coffide & Amorphous coffide \\ \hline Shape & Definite characteristic geometrical shape & Irregular shape \\ Melting point & Melt at a sharp and characteristic & Gradually soften over a range of temperature \\ Cleavage & When cut with a sharp edged tool, they & When cut with a sharp edged tool, they \\ property & split into two pieces and the newly & cut into two pieces with irregular \\  & generated surfaces are plain and & surfaces \\ Heat of fusion & They have a definite and characteristic & They do not have definite heat of fusion \\  & heat of fusion & \\ Anisotropy & Anisotropic in nature & Isotropic in nature \\ Nature & True solids & Pseudo solids or super cooled liquids \\ Order in & Long range order & Only short range order. \\ arrangement & & \\ of constituent & & \\ particles & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Ionic Solids

The ionic solids are formed by the three dimensional arrangements of cations and anions bound by strong coulombic (eletrovstatic) forces. These solids are hard and brittle in nature. They have high melting and boiling points. Since the ions are not free to move about, they are electrical insulators in the solid state. However. In the molten state or when dissolved in water, the ions become free to move about and they conduct electricity.

#### Metallic Solids

Metals are orderly collection of positive ions surrounded by and held together by a sea of free electrons. These electrons are mobile and are evenly spread out throughout the crystal. Each metal atom contributes one or more electrons towards this sea of mobile electrons. These free and mobile electrons are responsible for high electrical and thermal conductivity of metals. When an electric field is applied. these electrons flow through the network of positive ions. Similarly, when heat is supplied to one portion of a metal, the thermal energy is uniformly spread throughout by free electrons. Another important characteristic of metals is their lustre and colour in certain cases. This is also due to the presence of free electrons in them. Metals are highly malleable and ductile.

#### Covalent or Network Solids

A wide variety of crystalline solids of non-metals result from the formation of covalent bonds between adjacent atoms throughout the crystal. They are also called giant molecules. Covalent bonds are strong and directional in nature, therefore atoms are held very strongly at their positions. Such solids are very hard and brittle. They have extremely high melting points and may even decompose before melting. They are insulators and do not conduct electricity. Diamond (Fig. 3) and silicon carbide are typical examples of such solids. Graphite is soft and a conductor of electricity. Its exceptional properties are due to its typical structure (Fig. 4). Carbon atoms are arranged in different layers and each atom is covalently bonded to three of its neighbouring atoms in the same layer. The fourth valence electron of each atom is present between different layers and is free to move about. These free electrons make graphite a good conductor of electricity. Different layers can slide one over the other. This makes graphite a soft solid and a good solid lubricant.

Figure 14: (a) Square cbse packing (b) hexagonal close packing of spheres in two dimensions

Figure 13: Close packing of spheres in one dimension

In this arrangement, each sphere is in contact with four of its neighbours. Thus, the two dimensional coordination number is 4. Also, if the centres of these 4 immediate neighbouring spheres are joined, a square is formed. Hence this packing is called square close packing in two dimensions.
* The second row may be placed above the first one in a staggered manner such that its spheres fit in the depressions of the first row. If the arrangement of spheres in the first row is called 'A' type, the one in the second row is different and may be called 'B' type. When the third row is placed adjacent to the second in staggered manner, its spheres are aligned with those of the first layer. Hence this layer is also of 'A' type. The spheres of similarly placed fourth row will be aligned with those of the second row ('B' type). Hence this arrangement is of ABAB type. In this arrangement there is less free space and this packing is more efficient than the square close packing. Each sphere is in contact with six of its neighbours and the two dimensional coordination number is 6. The centres of these six spheres are at the corners of a regular hexagon (Fig. 1.14b) hence this packing is called two dimensional hexagonal close packing. It can be seen in Figure 1.14 (b) that in this layer there are some voids (empty spaces). These are triangular in shape. The triangular voids are of two different types. In one row, the apex of the triangles are pointing upwards and in the next layer downwards.
* _Close Packing in Three Dimensions_ All real structures are three dimensional structures. They can be obtained by stacking two dimensional layers one above the other. In the last Section, we discussed close packing in two dimensions which can be of two types: square close-packed and hexagonal close-packed. Let us see what types of three dimensional close packing can be obtained from these.
* _Three dimensional close packing from two dimensional square close-packed layers_: While placing the second square close-packed layer above the first we follow the same rule that was followed when one row was placed adjacent to the other. The second layer is placed over the first layer such that the spheres of the upper layer are exactly above those of the first layer. In this arrangement spheres of both the layers are perfectly aligned horizontally as well as vertically as shown in Fig. 1.15. Similarly, we may place more layers one above the other. If the arrangement of spheres in the first layer is called 'A' type, all the layers have the same arrangement. Thus this lattice has AAA... type pattern. The lattice thus generated is the simple cubic lattice, and its unit cell is the primitive cubic unit cell (See Fig. 1.9).
* _Three dimensional close packing from two dimensional hexagonal close packed layers_: Three dimensional close packed structure can be generated by placing layers one over the other.

Figure 1.15: Simple cubic lattice formed by AAA A... arrangement

#### (a) Placing second layer over the first layer

Let us take a two dimensional hexagonal close packed layer 'A' and place a similar layer above it such that the spheres of the second layer are placed in the depressions of the first layer. Since the spheres of the two layers are aligned differently, let us call the second layer as B. It can be observed from Fig. 16 that not all the triangular voids of the first layer are covered by the spheres of the second layer. This gives rise to different arrangements. Wherever a sphere of the second layer is above the void of the first layer (or vice versa) a tetrahedral void is formed. These voids are called tetrahedral voids because a _tetrahedron_ is formed when the centres of these four spheres are joined. They have been marked as 'T' in Fig. 16. One such void has been shown separately in Fig. 17.

Each small cube has atoms at alternate corners [Fig. 1(a)]. In all, each small cube has 4 atoms. When joined to each other, they make a regular tetrahedron. Thus, there is one tetrahedral void in each small cube and eight tetrahedral voids in total. Each of the eight small cubes have one void in one unit cell of \(ccp\) structure. We know that \(ccp\) structure has 4 atoms per unit cell. Thus, the number of tetrahedral voids is twice the number of atoms.

### Locating Octahedral Voids

Let us again consider a unit cell of \(ccp\) or \(fcc\) lattice [Fig. 2(a)]. The body centre of the cube, C is not occupied but it is surrounded by six atoms on face centres. If these face centres are joined, an octahedron is generated. Thus, this unit cell has one octahedral void at the body centre of the cube.

Besides the body centre, there is one octahedral void at the centre of each of the 12 edges. [Fig. 2(b)]. It is surrounded by six atoms, three belonging to the same unit cell (2 on the corners and 1 on face centre) and three belonging to two adjacent unit cells. Since each edge of the cube is shared between four adjacent unit cells, so is the octahedral void located on it. Only \(\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{4}}\) of each void belongs to a particular unit cell.

1.9 Implications in Solids

Although crystalline solids have short range as well as long range order in the arrangement of their constituent particles, yet crystals are not perfect. Usually a solid consists of an aggregate of large number of small crystals. These small crystals have defects in them. This happens when crystallisation process occurs at fast or moderate rate. Single crystals are formed when the process of crystallisation occurs at extremely slow rate. Even these crystals are not free of defects. The defects are basically irregularities in the arrangement of constituent particles. Broadly speaking, the defects are of two types, namely, _point defects_ and _line defects_. Point defects are the irregularities or deviations from ideal arrangement around a point or an atom in a crystalline substance. whereas the _line defects_ are the irregularities or deviations from ideal arrangement in entire rows of lattice points. These irregularities are called _crystal defects_. We shall confine our discussion to point defects only.

1.9.1 Types of Point defects can be classified into three types : (i) stoichiometric defects (ii) impurity defects and (iii) non-stoichiometric defects.

1. [label=()]
2. _Stoichiometric Defects_

These are the point defects that do not disturb the stoichiometry of the solid. They are also called _intrinsic_ or thermodynamic defects. Basically these are of two types. vacancy defects and interstitial defects.

1. [label=()]
2. _Vacancy Defect_: When some of the lattice sites are vacant, the crystal is said to have **vacancy defect** (Fig. 1.23). This results in decrease in density of the substance. This defect can also develop when a substance is heated.
3. _Interstitial Defect_: When some constituent particles (atoms or molecules) occupy an **interstitial** site, the crystal is said to have **interstitial defect** (Fig. 1.24). This defect increases the density of the substance.

Vacancy and interstitial defects as explained above can be shown by non-ionic solids. Ionic solids must always maintain electrical neutrality. Rather than simple vacancy or interstitial defects, they show these defects as **Frencheland Schottky defects**.

Figure 1.23: Vacancy defects

* _Frenkel Defect:_ This defect is shown by ionic solids. The smaller ion (usually cation) is dislocated from its normal site to an interstitial site (Fig. 25). It creates a _vacancy defect_ at its original site and an interstitial defect at its new location. _Frenkel defect is also called dislocation defect. It does not change the density of the solid. Frenkel defect is shown by ionic substance in which there is a large difference in the size of ions, for example, ZnS, AgCl, AgBr and AgI due to small size of Zn\({}^{2*}\) and Ag\({}^{*}\) ions.
* _Schottky Defect:_ It is basically a vacancy defect in ionic solids. In order to maintain electrical neutrality, the number of missing cations and anions are equal (Fig. 26). _Likes simple vacancy defect. Schottky defect also decreases the density of the substance. Number of such defects in ionic solids is quite significant. For example, in NaCl there are approximately \(10^{6}\) Schottky pairs per cm\({}^{3}\) at room temperature. In \(1\) cm\({}^{3}\) there are about \(1\)\(\Omega^{2}\) ions. Thus, there is one Schottky defect per \(10^{16}\) ions. Schottky defect is shown by ionic substances in which the cation and anion are of almost similar sizes. For example, NaCl, KCl, CsCl and AgBr. It may be noted that AgBr shows both, Frenkel as well as Schottky defects. _Impurity Defects_ If molten NaCl containing a little amount of SrCl\({}_{2}\) is crystallised, some of the sites of Na\({}^{*}\) ions are occupied by Sr\({}^{2*}\) (Fig.1.27). Each Sr\({}^{2*}\) replaces two Na\({}^{*}\) ions. It occupies the site of one ion and the other site remains vacant. The cationic vacancies thus produced are equal in number to that of Sr\({}^{2*}\) ions. Another similar example is the solid solution of CdCl\({}_{2}\) and AgCl. _Frenkel Defect:_ This defect is shown by ionic solids.

* _Insulators_ : These are the solids with very low conductivities ranging between \(10^{20}\) to \(10^{10}\)ohm\({}^{-1}\)m\({}^{-1}\).
* _Semiconductors_ : These are the solids with conductivities in the intermediate range from \(10^{-6}\) to \(10^{1}\)ohm\({}^{-1}\)m\({}^{-1}\).

A conductor may conduct electricity through movement of electrons or ions. Metallic conductors belong to the former category and electrolytes to the latter.

Metals conduct electricity in solid as well as molten state. The conductivity of metals depend upon the number of valence electrons available per atom. The atomic orbitals of metal atoms form molecular orbitals which are so close in energy to each other as to form a band. If this band is partially filled or it overlaps with a higher energy unoccupied conduction band, then electrons can flow easily under an applied electric field and the metal shows conductivity (Fig. 29 a).

If the gap between filled valence band and the next higher unoccupied band (conduction band) is large, electrons cannot jump to it and such a substance has very small conductivity and it behaves as an insulator (Fig. 29 b).

* In case of semiconductors, the gap between the valence band and conduction band is small (Fig. 29c). Therefore, some electrons may **Electricity** jump to conduction band and show some conductivity. Electrical **Semiconductors** more electrons can jump to the conduction band. Substances like silicon and germanium show this type of behaviour and are called _intrinsic semiconductors_. The conductivity of these intrinsic semiconductors is too low to be of practical use. Their conductivity is increased by adding an appropriate amount of suitable impurity. This process is called

doping._ Doping can be done with an impurity which is electron rich or electron deficient as compared to the intrinsic semiconductor silicon or germanium. Such impurities introduce _electronic defects_ in them.

_(a) Electron - rich impurities_

Silicon and germanium belong to group 14 of the periodic table and have four valence electrons each. In their crystals each atom forms four covalent bonds with its neighbours (Fig. 1.30 a). When doped with a group 15 element like P or As, which contains five valence electrons, they occupy some of the lattice sites in silicon or germanium crystal (Fig. 1.30 b). Four out of five electrons are used in the formation of four covalent bonds with the four neighbouring silicon atoms. The fifth electron is extra and becomes delocalised. These delocalised electrons increase the conductivity of doped silicon (or germanium). Here the increase in conductivity is due to the _negatively_ charged electron, hence silicon doped with electron-rich impurity is called _n-_type semiconductor.

_(b) Electron - deficit impurities_

Silicon or germanium can also be doped with a group 13 element like B, Al or Ga which contains only three valence electrons. The place where the fourth valence electron is missing is called _electron hole_ or _electron vacancy_ (Fig. 1.30 c). An electron from a neighbouring atom can come and fill the electron hole, but in doing so it would leave an electron hole at its original position. If it happens, it would appear as if the electron hole has moved in the direction opposite to that of the electron that filled it. Under the influence of electric field, electrons would move towards the positively charged plate through electronic holes, but it would appear as if electron holes are positively charged and are moving towards negatively charged plate. This type of semi conductors are called _p-type_ semiconductors.

* _Diamagnetism_: Diamagnetic substances are weakly repelled by a magnetic field. H\({}_{2}\)O, NaCl and C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\) are some examples of such substances. They are weakly magnetised in a magnetic field in opposite direction. Diamagnetism is shown by those substances in which all the electrons are paired and there are no unpaired electrons. Pairing of electrons cancels their magnetic moments and they lose their magnetic character.
* _Ferromagnetism_: A few substances like iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium and CrO\({}_{2}\) are attracted very strongly by a magnetic field. Such substances are called ferromagnetic substances. Besides strong attractions, these substances can be permanently magnetised. In solid state, the metal ions of ferromagnetic substances are grouped together into small regions called _domains_. Thus, each domain acts as a tiny magnet. In an unmagnetised piece of a ferromagnetic substance the domains are randomly oriented and their magnetic moments get cancelled. When the substance is placed in a magnetic field all the domains get oriented in the direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 1.32 a) and a strong magnetic effect is produced. This ordering of domains persist even when the magnetic field is removed and the ferromagnetic substance becomes a permanent magnet.
* _Antiferromagnetism_: Substances like MnO showing antiferromagnetism have domain structure similar to ferromagnetic substance, but their domains are oppositely oriented and cancel out each other's magnetic moment (Fig. 1.32 b).
* _Ferromagnetism_: Ferrimagnetism is observed when the magnetic moments of the domains in the substance are aligned in parallel and anti-parallel directions in unequal numbers (Fig. 1.32 c). They are weakly attracted by magnetic field as compared to ferromagnetic substances. Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\) (magnetlte) and ferrites like MgFe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) and ZnFe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) are examples of such substances. These substances also lose ferrimagnetism on heating and become paramagnetic.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

* describe the formation of different types of solutions;

In normal life we rarely come across pure substances. Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while 1.5 ppm causes the tooth to become motied and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on.

In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This will be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution.

### Types of Solutions

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 2.1.

### 2.2. _Expressing Concentration of Solutions_

Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitattively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution.

There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively.

(1) _Mass percentage (w/w)_: The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as:

Mass % of a component

Mass of the component in the solution

Total mass of the solution

For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.

(2) _Volume percentage (v/v)_: The volume percentage is defined as:

Volume % of a component = Volume of the component \(\times\)100

Total volume of solution

#### 2.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid

Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like.

When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.

Solute + Solvent Solution (2.10)

At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.

Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon.

Effect of temperatureThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 2.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle, in general, if in a _nearly saturated solution_, the dissolution process is endothermic (\(\Delta_{\text{sol}}\) H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic (\(\Delta_{\text{sol}}\) H > 0) the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.

Effect of pressurePressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.

Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure andtemperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 2.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure \(p\) and temperature \(T\). Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 2.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases.

Henry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry's law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry's law states that "the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (\(p\)) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas (\(x\)) in the solution" and is expressed as:

\[p=K_{\text{H}}\ x \tag{2.11}\]

Here \(K_{\text{H}}\) is the Henry's law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 2.2.

Different gases have different \(K_{\text{H}}\) values at the same temperature [Table 2.2]. This suggests that \(K_{\text{H}}\) is a function of the nature of the gas.

It is obvious from equation (2.11) that higher the value of \(K_{\text{H}}\) at a given pressure. the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 2.2 that \(K_{\text{H}}\) values for both \(N_{\text{2}}\) and \(O_{\text{2}}\) increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases

the partial vapour pressure of each component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. Thus, for component 1 \[p_{1}\propto x_{1}\] and \[p_{1}=p_{1}^{0}x_{1}\] (2.12) where \(p_{1}^{0}\) is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same temperature. Similarly, for component 2 \[p_{2}=p_{2}^{\ 0}x_{2}\] (2.13) where \(p_{2}^{\ 0}\) represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure (\(p_{\rm total}\)) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: \[p_{\rm total}=p_{1}+p_{2}\] (2.14) Substituting the values of \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\), we get \[p_{\rm total}=x_{1}\,p_{1}^{\ 0}+x_{2}\,p_{2}^{\ 0}\] (2.15) \[=(1-x_{2})\,p_{1}^{\ 0}+x_{2}\,p_{2}^{\ 0}\] (2.16) \[=p_{1}^{\ 0}+(p_{2}^{\ 0}-p_{1}^{\ 0})x_{2}\] (2.16) Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (2.16).
* Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component.
* Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2.
* Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. A plot of \(p_{1}\) or \(p_{2}\) versus the mole fractions \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 2.3. These lines (I and II) pass through the points and respectively when \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) equal unity. Similarly the plot (line III) of \(p_{\rm total}\) versus \(x_{2}\) is also linear (Fig. 2.3). The minimum value of \(p_{\rm total}\) is \(p_{1}^{\ 0}\) and the maximum value is \(p_{2}^{\ 0}\), assuming that component 1 is less volatile than component 2, i.e., \(p_{1}^{\ 0}<p_{2}^{\ 0}\).

The composition of vapour phase in equilibrium with the solution is determined by the partial pressures of the components. If \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) are the mole fractions of the

**Note:** Since, CHCl3 is a more volatile component than CHCl3, [\(p_{\rm{CH_{2}Cl_{2}}=415\ mm\ Hg}\) and \(p_{\rm{CH_{3}}=200\ mm\ Hg}\) and the vapour phase is also richer in CH2Cl2 [\(y_{\rm{CH_{2}Cl_{2}}=0.82}\) and \(y_{\rm{CH_{3}}=0.18}\)]. it may thus be concluded that at equilibrium, vapour phase will be always rich in the component which is more volatile.

#### 2.4.2 Raoult's Law as a special case of Henry's Law

According to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component in a given solution is given by \(p_{i}=x_{i}p_{i}^{\,0}\). In the solution of a gas in a liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry's law which states that

\[p=K_{\mbox{\tiny H}}\,x.\]

If we compare the equations for Raoult's law and Henry's law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the proportionality constant \(K_{\mbox{\tiny H}}\) differs from \(p_{i}^{\,0}\). Thus, Raoult's law becomes a special case of Henry's law in which \(K_{\mbox{\tiny H}}\) becomes equal to \(p_{i}^{\,0}\).

Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and can sugar in water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. We have learnt in Unit 5, Class XI, that liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 2.4 (a)]. In a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 2.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced.

The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature.

Raoult's law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.

In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let \(p_{i}\) be

Figure 2.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the solvent on account of the presence of solute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the molecules of the solvent from its surface is denoted by \(\blacksquare\). (b) in a solution. solute particles have been denoted by\(\oplus\)a and they also occupy part of the surface area.

the vapour pressure of the solvent, \(x_{i}\) be its mole fraction, \(p_{i}^{0}\) be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult's law

\[p_{1}\propto x_{i} \tag{2.20}\]

and \(p_{1}=x_{i}\ p_{1}^{0}\)

The proportionality constant is equal to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, \(p_{1}^{0}\). A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 2.5).

Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult's law.

The solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as _ideal solutions_. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e.,

\[\Delta_{\text{max}}H=0,\hskip 28.452756pt\Delta_{\text{max}}V=0 \tag{2.21}\]

It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.

#### Non-ideal Solutions

When a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called _non-ideal solution_. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law (equation 2.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult's law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 2.6.

The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour

Figure 2.5: If a solution obeys Raoult’s law for all concentrations, its vapour pressure would turn linearly from zero to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent.

pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 2.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulfide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.

In case of negative deviations from Raoult's law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown.

This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 2.6. (b)].

Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult's law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:441]

The expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute. The above equation can be written as:

\[\frac{p_{1}^{0}-p_{1}}{p_{1}^{0}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}\cdot\left(\text{ since }x_{2}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}\right) \tag{2.26}\]

Here \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively present in the solution. For dilute solutions \(n_{2}<n_{1}\), hence neglecting \(n_{2}\) in the denominator we have

\[\frac{p_{1}^{0}-p_{1}}{p_{1}^{0}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \tag{2.27}\]

or \[\frac{p_{1}^{0}-p_{1}}{p_{1}^{0}}=\frac{\text{w}_{2}\times M_{1}}{M_{2}\times w _{1}}\] (2.28)

Here \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\) are the masses and \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\) are the molar masses of the solvent and solute respectively.

From this equation (2.28), knowing all other quantities, the molar mass of solute (\(M_{2}\)) can be calculated.

We have learnt in Unit 5, Class XI, that the vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373.15 K (100\({}^{\circ}\) C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non-volatile solute. Fig. 2.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 2.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at one atmospheric pressure.

Let \(T_{b}^{0}\) be the boiling point of pure solvent and \(T_{b}\) be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point \(\Delta T_{b}=T_{b}-T_{b}^{0}\) is known as elevation of boiling point.

Experiments have shown that for dilute solutions the elevation of boiling point (\(\Delta T_{b}\)) is directly proportional to the mol concentration of the solute in a solution. Thus

\[\Delta T_{b}\propto m \tag{2.29}\]

or \(\Delta T_{b}=K_{b}\)\(m\) (2.30)

Here \(m\) (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 kg of solvent and the constant of proportionality, \(K_{b}\) is called Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Modal Elevation Constant (Ebulloscopic Constant). The unit of \(K_{b}\) is K kg mol\({}^{-1}\). Values of \(K_{b}\) for some common solvents are given in Table 2.3. If \(w_{2}\) gram of solute of molar mass \(M_{2}\) is dissolved in \(w_{2}\) gram of solvent, then molality, \(m\) of the solution is given by the expression:

\[m =\frac{\cdot\,w_{2}/M_{2}}{w_{1}/1000}=\frac{\cdot\,1000\times w_{2}}{M_{2} \times w_{1}} \tag{2.31}\]

Substituting the value of molality in equation (2.30) we get

\[\Delta T_{b} =\frac{\cdot\,K_{b}\times 1000\times w_{2}}{M_{2}\times w_{1}} \tag{2.32}\] \[M_{2} =\frac{1\,000\times w_{2}\times K_{b}}{\Delta T_{b}\times w_{1}} \tag{2.33}\]

Thus, in order to determine \(M_{2}\), molar mass of the solute, known mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and \(\Delta T_{b}\) is determined experimentally for a known solvent whose \(K_{b}\) value is known.

18 g of glucose, \(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\), is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a saucepan.

At what temperature will water boil at 1.013 bar? \(K_{b}\) for water is 0.52

K kg mol\({}^{-1}\).

Moles of glucose = 18 g/ 180 g mol\({}^{-1}\) = 0.1 mol Solution

Number of kilograms of solvent = 1 kg

Thus molality of glucose solution = 0.1 mol kg\({}^{-1}\)

For water, change in boiling point

Figure 2.7: The vapour pressure curve for solutions below the antergourne water The diagram shows that \(\Delta T_{b}\) denotes the elevation of boiling point of a solvent in solution.

\(\mathbb{X}T_{b}=K_{b}\times m=0.52\) K kg mol\({}^{-1}\times 0.1\) mol kg\({}^{-1}\) = 0.052 K Since water boils at 373.15 K at 1.013 bar pressure, therefore, the boiling point of solution will be 373.15 + 0.052 = 373.202 K.

The boiling point of benzene is 353.23 K. When 1.80 \(g\) of a non-volatile solute was dissolved in 90 g of benzene, the boiling point is raised to 354.11 K, Calculate the molar mass of the solute, \(K_{b}\) for benzene is 2.53 K kg mol\({}^{-1}\)

The elevation \(\mathbb{(}\bar{\alpha}T_{b}\mathrm{)}\) in the boiling point = 354.11 K - 353.23 K = 0.88 K Substituting these values in expression (2.33) we get

\(M_{2}=\frac{2.53\) K kg mol\({}^{-1}\times 1.8\) g \(\times\) 1000 g kg\({}^{-1}\)

\(0.88\) K \(\times\) 90 g

Therefore, molar mass of the solute, \(M_{2}=58\) g mol\({}^{-1}\)

The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 28). We know that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 2.8. According to Raoult's law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases.

Let \(T_{t}^{0}\) be the freezing point of pure solvent and \(T_{t}\) be its freezing point when non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. The decrease in freezing point.

\(\Delta T_{t}=T_{t}^{0}-T_{t}\) is known as depression in freezing point.

Similar to elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point (\(\Delta T_{p}\) for dilute solution (ideal solution) is directly proportional to molalty, m of the solution. Thus,

\(\Delta T_{t}\approx m\) or \(\Delta T_{t}=K_{t}m\)

The proportionality constant, \(K_{t}\), which depends on the nature of the solvent is known as Freezing Point Depression Constant or M 

**Depression Constant or Cryoscopic Constant.** The unit of \(K_{t}\) is \(K\,kg\) mol\({}^{-1}\). Values of \(K_{t}\) for some common solvents are listed in Table 2.3.

If \(w_{2}\) gram of the solute having molar mass as \(M_{2}\), present in \(w_{1}\) gram of solvent, produces the depression in freezing point \(\Delta T_{t}\) of the solvent then modality of the solute is given by the equation (2.31).

\[m = \frac{w_{2}\ /\ M_{2}}{w_{1}/1000}\] (2.31) Substituting this value of modality in equation (2.34) we get:

\[\Delta T_{t} = \frac{K_{t}\ \times\ w_{2}\ /\ M_{2}}{w_{1}/1000}\] \[\Delta T_{t} = \frac{K_{t}\ \times\ w_{2}\ \times 1000}{M_{2}\ \times w_{1}} \tag{2.35}\] \[M_{2} = \frac{K_{t}\ \times\ w_{2}\ \times 1000}{\Delta T_{t}\ \times w_{1}} \tag{2.36}\]

Thus for determining the molar mass of the solute we should know the quantities \(w_{1}\), \(w_{2}\), \(\Delta T_{p}\), along with the molal freezing point depression constant.

The values of \(K_{t}\) and \(K_{b}\), which depend upon the nature of the solvent, can be ascertained from the following relations.

\[K_{t} = \frac{R\times M_{1}\times T_{t}^{2}}{1000\times\Delta_{\text{ins} }H} \tag{2.37}\] \[K_{0} = \frac{R\times M_{1}\times T_{b}^{2}}{1000\times\Delta_{\text{ unp}}H} \tag{2.38}\]

Here the symbols \(R\) and \(M_{1}\) stand for the gas constant and molar mass of the solvent, respectively and \(T_{t}\) and \(T_{b}\) denote the freezing point and the boiling point of the pure solvent respectively in kelvin. Further, \(\Delta_{\text{ins}}H\) and \(\Delta_{\text{ unp}}H\) represent the enthalpies for the fusion and vapourisation of the solvent, respectively.

macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility.

Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semippermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell.

The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into them through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/volume) salt, blood cells collapse due to loss of water by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candidid fruit loses water, shrivels and dles.

#### Reverse

The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 2.11. When pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose.

The pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use desalination plants to meet their potable water requirements.

#### Flow

We know that ionic compounds when dissolved in water dissociate into cations and anions. For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl (74.5 g) in water, we expect one mole each of K' and Cl' ions to be released in the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in one kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by 2 \(\times\) 0.52 K = 1.04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of

Electrochemistry is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations. The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:458]

As mentioned earlier (Class XI, Unit 8) a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc.

Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs.

Zn(s) + Cu\({}^{2*}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2*}\) (aq) + Cu(s)

This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction:

1. Cu\({}^{2*}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (3.2)
2. Zn(s) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2*}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) (oxidation half reaction) (3.3)

These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell.

We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 3.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we don't require a salt bridge.

Figure 3.2: Function of Daniell cell when external voltage \(E_{\text{ext}}\) opposing the cell potential is applied.

At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called **electrode potential**. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as **standard electrode potential**. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called **anode** and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called **cathode** and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the _on_ position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow.

The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the _cell potential_ and is measured in volts. The _cell potential_ is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the _cell electromagnetic force (emf)_ of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right - while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e.

\[E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{right}}\ -\ E_{\text{left}}\]

This is illustrated by the following example:

Cell reaction:

Cu(s) + 2Ag^(aq) - Cu^2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s)

Half-cell reactions:

Cathode (_reduction_): 2Ag^(aq) + 2e^- - 2Ag(s)

Anode (_oxidation_): Cu(s) - Cu^2+(aq) + 2e^- (3.6)

It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (3.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:

Cu(s) 1Cu^2*(aq) 1Ag^(aq) 1Ag(s)

and we have \(E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{right}}-E_{\text{left}}=E_{\text{Ag^{\prime}}\mid \text{Ag}}-E_{\text{Cu^{\prime}}\mid\text{Cu}}\)

The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (halfcell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by Pt(s) \(\mid\)H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\mid\)H\({}^{*}\)(aq), is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction

H\({}^{*}\) (aq) + e\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\frac{\cdot}{2}\) H\({}_{2}\)(g)

The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 3.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar.

At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode \(\mid\)\(\mid\) second half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential,E\({}_{{}_{\rm R}}^{\rm o}\) of the given half-cell.

E\({}^{\rm o}\) = E\({}_{{}_{\rm R}}^{\rm o}\)\(-\) E\({}_{{}_{\rm L}}^{\rm o}\)

As _B\({}_{{}_{\rm L}}^{\rm o}\)_ for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.

E\({}^{\rm o}\) = E\({}_{{}_{\rm R}}^{\rm o}\)\(-\) 0 = E\({}_{{}_{\rm R}}^{\rm o}\)

The measured emf of the cell :

Pt(s) \(\mid\) H\({}_{2}\)(g, 1 bar) \(\mid\) H\({}^{*}\) (aq, 1 M) \(\mid\) Cu\({}^{2*}\) (aq, 1 M) \(\mid\) Cu

is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction :

Cu\({}^{2*}\) (aq, 1M) + 2 e\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s)

Similarly, the measured emf of the cell :

Pt(s) \(\mid\) H\({}_{2}\)(g, 1 bar) \(\mid\) H\({}^{*}\) (aq, 1 M) \(\mid\) Zn\({}^{2*}\) (aq, 1M) \(\mid\) Zn

is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction:

Zn\({}^{2*}\) (aq, 1 M) + 2e\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\) Zn(s)

The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that Cu\({}^{2*}\) ions get reduced more easily than H\({}^{*}\) ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).

Figure 3.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).

In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 3.1 can be written as:

Left electrode : Zn(s) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2+}\) (aq, 1 M) + 2 e\({}^{-}\)

Right electrode: Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq, 1 M) + 2 e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s)

The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation:

Zn(s) + Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + Cu(s)

Emf of the cell = \(E_{\text{cell}}^{0}\) = \(E_{\text{R}}^{0}\) - \(E_{\text{L}}^{0}\)

= 0.34V - [-0.76]V = 1.10 V

Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions for the conduction of electrons. For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:

Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s) 1H\({}_{2}\)(g) 1 H\({}^{2}\)(aq)

With half-cell reaction: H\({}^{2}\)(aq)+ e \(\rightarrow\)\(\downarrow_{\text{Z}}\) H\({}_{2}\)(g)

Bromine electrode: Pt(s) 1Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) 1 Br\({}^{2}\)(aq)

With half-cell reaction: \(\downarrow_{\text{Z}}\) Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Br\({}^{\prime}\)(aq)

The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 3.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F\({}_{2}\)) has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F\({}^{\prime}\)) and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 3.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations.

\(\frac{[Zn^{2}\cdot]}{[Cu^{2}\cdot]}=K_{\rm c}\) for the reaction 3.1 and at T = 298K the above equation can be written as

\[E^{\rm a}_{\rm(cell)}=\frac{0.059\;{\rm V}}{2}\;\log\;K_{\rm C}=1.1\;{\rm V} \qquad\qquad(E^{\rm a}_{\rm(cell)}=1.1{\rm V})\]

\[\log\;K_{\rm C}=\frac{(1.1{\rm V}\times 2)}{0.059\;{\rm V}}-37.288\]

\(K_{\rm C}=2\;\times\;10^{37}\) at 298K.

In general,

\[E^{\rm a}_{\rm(cell)}=\frac{2.303RT}{nF}\;\log\;K_{\rm C} \tag{3.14}\]

Thus, Eq. (3.14) gives a relationship between equilibrium constant of the reaction and standard potential of the cell in which that reaction takes place. Thus, equilibrium constants of the reaction, difficult to measure otherwise, can be calculated from the corresponding \(E^{\rm o}\) value of the cell.

**Example 3.2**: Calculate the equilibrium constant of the reaction:

\(\rm Cu(s)+2Ag^{*}(aq)\to Cu^{2*}(aq)+2Ag(s)\)

\(E^{\rm o}_{\rm(cell)}=0.46\;{\rm V}\)

\(E^{\rm o}_{\rm(cell)}=\frac{0.059\;{\rm V}}{2}\;\log\;K_{\rm C}=0.46\;{\rm V}\) or

\(\log\;K_{\rm C}=\frac{0.46\;{\rm V}\times 2}{0.059\;{\rm V}}=15.6\)

\(K_{\rm C}=3.92\;\times\;10^{15}\)

Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is \(E\) and \(nF\) is the amount of charge passed and \(\Delta_{\rm r}G\) is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then

\(\Delta_{\rm r}G=-\;nF\!E_{\rm(cell)}\)

It may be remembered that \(E_{\rm(cell)}\) is an intensive parameter but \(\Delta_{\rm r}G\) is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on \(n\). Thus, if we write the reaction

\[\begin{array}{l}{\rm Zn(s)+Cu^{2*}(aq)\longrightarrow Zn^{2*}(aq)+Cu(s)}\\ \Delta_{\rm r}G=-2F\!E_{\rm(cell)}\end{array} \tag{3.1}\]

but when we write the reaction

from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, \(l\), and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, \(A\). That is,

\[R\approx\ \overset{\cdot}{\underset{A}{\cdot}}\ \text{or}\ R=\rho\ \overset{\cdot}{ \underset{A}{\cdot}} \tag{3.17}\]

The constant of proportionality, \(\rho\) (Greek, rho), is called **resistivity** (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (\(\Omega\) m) and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre (\(\Omega\) cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one m\({}^{2}\). It can be seen that:

1 \(\Omega\) m = 100 \(\Omega\) cm or 1 \(\Omega\) cm = 0.01 \(\Omega\) m

The inverse of resistance, \(R\), is called **conductance**, \(G\), and we have the relation:

\[G=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{A}{\cdot}}}{R}=\kappa\frac{A}{l} \tag{3.18}\]

The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol 'S' and is equal to ohm\({}^{-1}\) (also known as mho) or \(\Omega^{-1}\). The inverse of resistivity, called **conductivity** (specific conductance) is represented by the symbol, \(\kappa\) (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are S m\({}^{-1}\) but quite often, \(\kappa\) is expressed in S cm\({}^{-1}\). Conductivity of a material in S m\({}^{-1}\) is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area of cross section is 1 m\({}^{2}\). It may be noted that 1 S cm\({}^{-1}\) = 100 S m\({}^{-1}\).

It can be seen from Table 3.2 that the magnitude of conductivity varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurementsare made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers1 are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.

Footnote 1: _Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shtrakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be polymersted to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic insure and conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyantine, polyuprite and polythiophene. These organic metals, being composed wholly of elements like carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexolbity so that one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shtrakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000._

Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on

(i) the nature and structure of the metal

(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom

(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).

As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.

We already know (Class XI, Unit 7) that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (-10\({}^{7}\)M) which lend it very low conductivity (3.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) S m\({}^{-1}\)). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on:

(i) the nature of the electrolyte added

(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation

(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity

(iv) concentration of the electrolyte

(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).

Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions (Section 3.4.1).

We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called **conductivity cell**. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 3.4.

Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to 'A' and are separated by distance 'I'. Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length \(l\) and area of cross section \(A\). The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:

\[R=\rho\ \frac{l}{A}\ =\ \frac{\cdot}{\kappa A} \tag{3.17}\]

The quantity \(l\)/\(A\) is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, \(G^{\bullet}\). It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length[1] and can be calculated if we know \(l\) and \(A\). Measurement of \(l\) and \(A\) is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 3.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, \(G^{\bullet}\), is then given by the equation:

\[G^{\bullet}=\frac{l}{A}\ =\ R\ K \tag{3.18}\]

Figure 3.4: Two different types of conductivity cells.

Once the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 3.5.

It consists of two resistances \(R_{3}\) and \(R_{4}\), a variable resistance \(R_{1}\) and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance \(R_{2}\). The Wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions:

\[\text{Unknown resistance }R_{2}=\frac{\text{R}_{1}\text{R}_{4}}{\text{R}_{3}} \tag{3.19}\]

These days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation:

\[\text{k}=\frac{\text{cell constant}}{\text{R}}=\frac{\text{G}^{*}}{\text{R}} \tag{3.20}\]

The conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size of the ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called **molar conductivity** denoted by the symbol \(\lambda_{m}\) (Greek, lambda). It is related to the conductivity of the solution by the equation:

\[\text{Molar conductivity }=\lambda_{m}=\frac{\kappa}{\text{c}} \tag{3.21}\]

In the above equation, if x is expressed in S m-1 and the concentration,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:472]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:473]

platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation:

\(G=\frac{\kappa A}{l}=\kappa\) (both \(A\) and \(l\) are unity in their appropriate units in m or cm)

Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume \(V\) of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section \(A\) and distance of unit length. Therefore,

\(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}=\frac{\kappa A}{l}=\kappa\)

Since \(l=1\) and \(A=V\) ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)

\(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}=\kappa\)

Molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, \(V\), of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in \(\kappa\) on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, \(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}\) can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. When concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as **limiting molar conductivity** and is represented by the symbol \(E_{{}_{m}}^{{}^{*}}\). The variation in \(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}\) with concentration is different (Fig. 3.6) for strong and weak electrolytes.

For strong electrolytes, \(\Lambda\) increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation:

\(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}=E_{{}_{m}}^{{}^{*}}-A\) c\({}^{{}^{3}}\)

It can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 3.12) \(\Lambda_{{}_{m}}\) against \(c^{1/2}\), we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to \(E_{{}_{m}}^{{}^{*}}\)and slope equal to \(\ddots A\). The value of the constant \(\Lambda\)' for a given solvent and t emperature

depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in

Figure 3.6: _Molar conductivity versus c\({}^{1/2}\) for acetic acid (tweak electrolyte) and potassium chloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous solutions._

the solution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl\({}_{2}\), MgSO\({}_{4}\) are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the same value for 'A'.

There were no constant current sources available during Faraday's times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (\(\emptyset\)) sources available and the quantity of electricity \(\mathcal{G}\), passed is given by

\(\mathcal{G}=\mathit{It}\)

\(\mathcal{G}\) is in coloumbs when \(\mathit{I}\) is in ampere and \(\mathit{t}\) is in second.

The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction:

\[\mathrm{Ag}\ ^{*}(\mathrm{aq})\ +\ \mathrm{e}^{-}\rightarrow\mathrm{Ag}( \mathrm{s}) \tag{3.30}\]

One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021\(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\)C. Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:

\(N_{{}_{A}}\times 1.6021\times 10^{-19}\)\(\mathrm{C}=6.02\times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\times 1.6021\times 10^{-19}\)

\(\mathrm{C}=96487\)\(\mathrm{C}\)\(\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\)

This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol \(\mathbb{F}\).

For approximate calculations we use 1F = 96500 C mol\({}^{-1}\).

For the electrode reactions:

\[\mathrm{Mg}^{2*}(\mathrm{I})\ +\ 2\mathrm{e}^{-}\longrightarrow\mathrm{Mg}( \mathrm{s}) \tag{3.31}\]

\[\mathrm{Al}^{3*}(\mathrm{I})\ +\ 3\mathrm{e}^{-}\longrightarrow\mathrm{Al}( \mathrm{s}) \tag{3.32}\]

It is obvious that one mole of \(\mathrm{Mg}^{2*}\) and \(\mathrm{Al}^{3*}\) require 2 mol of electrons (2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolyte cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperees and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 F per second.

A solution of \(\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}\) is electrlysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?

\(\mathit{t}\) = 600 s charge = current \(\times\) time = 1.5 A \(\times\) 600 s = 900 C

\(\mathrm{Solution}\)

According to the reaction:

\(\mathrm{Cu}^{2*}(\mathrm{aq})\ +\ 2\mathrm{e}^{-}\) = Cu(s)

We require 2F or 2 \(\times\) 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu.

For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited = (63 g mol\({}^{-1}\)\(\times\) 900 C)/(2 \(\times\) 96487 C mol\({}^{-1}\))

= 0.2938 g.

Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being electrlysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these don't seem to take place and extra potential (called _overpotential_) has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.

For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and Cl2 gas. Here we have only one cation (Na*) which is reduced at the cathode (Na* + e- Na) and one anion (CI) which is oxidised at the anode (CI-> %2Cl2+e-). During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl2 and H2. In this case besides Na* and CI ions we also have H* and OH* ions along with the solvent molecules, H2O.

At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction reactions:

Na* (aq) + e- Na Na (s) \(E^{\alpha}_{\rm{cell}}\) = - 2.71 V

H* (aq) + e- \(\nu_{2}\) H2 (g) \(E^{\alpha}_{\rm{cell}}\) = 0.00 V

The reaction with higher value of E\({}^{\alpha}\) is preferred and, therefore, the reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:

H* (aq) + e- \(\nu_{2}\) H2 (g) but H* (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H2O, i.e., H2O (I) + H* (aq) + OH* (aq)

Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum of (3.33) and (3.34) and we have

H2O (I) + e- \(\nu_{2}\)H2(g) + OH* (3.35)

At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:

CI (aq) \(\rightarrow\) % Cl2 (g) + e- \(E^{\alpha}_{\rm{cell}}\) = 1.36 V

2H2O (I) \(\rightarrow\) O2 (g) + 4H*(aq) + 4e- \(E^{\alpha}_{\rm{cell}}\) = 1.23 V

The reaction at anode with lower value of E\({}^{\alpha}\) is preferred and therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to CI (aq). However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (3.36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as:

NaCl (aq) \(\stackrel{{\rm H_{O}}}{{\longrightarrow}}\) Na* (aq) + CI* (aq)

Cathode: \(\stackrel{{\rm H_{2}O(I)}}{{\longrightarrow}}\) + e- \(\nu_{2}\) H2(g) + OH* (aq)

Anode: \(\stackrel{{\rm CI}}{{\longrightarrow}}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) % Cl2(g) + e- \(\nu_{2}\)

Net reaction:

NaCl(aq) + H2O(I) \(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq) + OH*(aq) + %H2(g) + %Cl2(g)

The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation (Eq. 3.8) to take into account the concentration effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes are possible at the anode:

\[2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O(I)}\rightarrow\mbox{O}_{2}\mbox{g(g)}+4\mbox{H}^{*}\mbox {(aq)}+4\mbox{e}^{-}\stackrel{{\rm C^{0}}}{{\longrightarrow}}= +1.23\mbox{ V}, \tag{3.38}\]

A n o t h e r important secondary cell is the nickel-cadmium cell (Fig. 3.11) which has longer life than the lead storage cell but more expensive to manufacture. We shall not go into details of working of the cell and the electrode reactions during charging and discharging. The overall reaction during discharge is:

Cd (s)+2Ni[OH]3 (s) Cdo (s) +2Ni[OH]2 (s) +H2O(l) Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy (heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.

One of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water (Fig. 3.12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions. The electrode reactions are given below:

Cathode: O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e-> 4OH(aq)

Anode: 2H2 (g) + 4OH(aq) -> 4H2O(l) + 4e-

The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). \(\propto\) H\({}_{2}\)O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.

Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object.

#### 3.1.4 The Hydrogen Economy

At present the main source of energy that is drving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the 'Greenhouse Effect'. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth's surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldires face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.

#### 3.1.5 Summary

An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-spontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and anode (\(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{0}\) = \(E_{\mathrm{electrode}}^{0}\) - \(E_{\mathrm{electrode}}^{0}\) anode). The standard potential of the cells are related to standard Gibbs energy (\(\bar{A}_{\mathrm{r}}G^{\mathrm{a}}\) = \(-\)\(nF\)\(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{0}\)) and equilibrium constant (\(\bar{A}_{\mathrm{r}}G^{\mathrm{a}}\) = \(-\)\(RT\) ln \(R\)) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.

The conductivity, x, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, \(E_{\mathrm{age}}\), is defined by = \(\kappa\)\(/c\) where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.

It can be seen (Table 4.1) that the average rate falls from \(1.90\times\ 0^{4}\) molL's-1 to \(0.4\times 10^{-4}\) = mol L's-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt (i.e. when \(\Delta t\) approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally small dt instantaneous rate is given by

\[r_{\rm av}=\frac{-\Delta[R]}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta[P]}{\Delta t}\qquad. \tag{4.3}\]

The differential form of this rate expression is given as

\[-\frac{\mathsf{d}[R]}{\mathsf{d}t}=k[\mathbf{NO}\widehat{\mathsf{f}}\,[\,\mathsf{ O}_{2}\,]\]

Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.

Some other examples are given below:

Reaction

Experimental rate expression

1. CHCl3 + Cl2 \(\rightarrow\) CCl + HCl

Rate = \(k[\)CH3\({}_{3}\)\(]\)[Cl]1/2

2 CH5COOC2H5 + HQ \(\rightarrow\) CH3COOH + C2H5OH

Rate = \(k[\)CH3COOC2H5\(]\)1[H2O0\(]\)

In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:

_Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined experimentally._

#### 4.2.3 Order of a Reaction

In the rate equation (4.4)

Rate = \(k[\)A\(]^{\kappa}\)[B]Y

x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration of A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (4.4) gives the overall order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect to the reactants A and B respectively.

Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that chemical reaction.

Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of reactants.

Calculate the overall order of a reaction whkh has the rate expression

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\left[\,\mathsf{C}_{\text{X}\text{X}\text{X}\text{Y}}\right]\) & \(\mathsf{a}_{\text{R}}\) = \(k[\)A\(]^{1/2}\)[B]\({}^{3/2}\) \\ \(\left[\,\mathsf{O}_{\text{R}}\right]\) & Rate = \(k[\)A\(]^{\kappa}\)[B]Y \\  & order = x + y \\  & So order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order \\  & (b) order = 3/2 + [-1] = 1/2, i.e., half order. \\ \end{tabular}

A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one step. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary reactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism) gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.

These may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol, aldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions (e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol).

_Units of rate constant_

For a general reaction

aA + bB \(\rightarrow\) cC + dD

Rate = \(k\) [A]\({}^{*}\) [B]\({}^{\prime}\)

Where x + y = n = order of the reaction

\(k\) = \(\frac{\text{Rate}}{\text{[A]}^{*}\text{[B]}^{\prime}}\)

\(=\frac{\text{concentration}}{\text{time}}\) x \(\frac{1}{\text{(concentration)}^{n}}\)

Taking SI units of concentration, mol L\({}^{-1}\) and time, s, the units of \(k\) for different reaction order are listed in Table 4.3

#### 4.2.4 Molecularity

Another property of a reaction called molecularity helps in understanding its mechanism. The number of reacting species

**Reaction** (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction,

which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction. The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.

\(\frac{\text{10}_{\text{11}}}{\text{Chemical Kinetics}}\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Reaction & Order & Unit of rate constant \\ \hline Zero order reaction & 0 & \(\frac{\text{mol}^{-1}}{\text{s}}\times\frac{1}{\text{(mol}^{-1})^{0}}\) – molL\({}^{-1}\)s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline First order reaction & 1 & \(\frac{\text{mol}^{-1}}{\text{s}}\times\frac{1}{\text{(mol}^{-1})^{1}}=\text{s}^{ -1}\) \\ \hline Second order reaction & 2 & \(\frac{\text{mol}^{-1}}{\text{s}}\times\frac{1}{\text{(mol}^{-1})^{2}}=\text{mol}^ {-1}\text{L}\)s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4.3: Units of rate constant NH4NO2 \(\rightarrow\) N2 + 2H2O

Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.

2HI \(\rightarrow\) H2 + I2

Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example,

2NO + O2 \(\rightarrow\) 2NO2

The probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small. Hence, the molecularity greater than three is not observed.

It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step.

KClO3 + 6FeSO4 + 3H2SO4 \(\rightarrow\) KCl + 3Fe2(SO4)3 + 3H2O

This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.

2H2O2 \(\rightarrow\) 2H2O + O2

The rate equation for this reaction is found to be

\(\cdot\cdot\cdot\)

Rate = -d[H2O2] dt = k[H2O2][1\(\cdot\)]

This reaction is first order with respect to both H2O2 and \(\Gamma\). Evidences suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps

1. H2O2 + \(\Gamma\) \(\rightarrow\) H2O + 1O
2. H2O2 + 1O\(\cdot\) \(\rightarrow\) H2O + \(\Gamma\) + O2

Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO' is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.

Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:

1. Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.
2. Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions. For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.

* For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and generally, molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall reaction.

_Interval Questions_

* For a reaction, A + B \(\rightarrow\) Product; the rate law is given by, \(r=k\left[\left.\right.\right]^{1/2}\left[\left.\right]\right.\)What is the order of the reaction?
* The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics. If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y?

We have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination of slope of the tangent at point 'f in concentration vs time plot (Fig. 4.1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction, In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times and rate constant.

The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions.

* Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional

#### 4.3.3 Half-Life of a

The half-life of a reaction is the time in which the concentration of a reactant is reduced to one half of its initial concentration. It is represented as \(t_{{}_{1/2}}\).

For a zero order reaction, rate constant is given by equation 4.7.

\[k=\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}-\left[{\rm R}\right]}{t}\] \[\cdot\] At \[t=t_{{}_{1/2}},\;\;\left[{\rm R}\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left[{\rm R}\right]\]

The rate constant at \(t_{{}_{1/2}}\) becomes

\[k=\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}-1/2\left[{\rm R}\right]}{t_{{}_{1/2}}}\] \[\cdot\] \[t_{{}_{1/2}}=\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}}{2k}\]

It is clear that \(t_{{}_{1/2}}\) for a zero order reaction is directly proportional to the initial concentration of the reactants and inversely proportional to the rate constant.

For the first order reaction,

\[\cdot\] \[k=\frac{2.303}{t}\log\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}}{\left[{\rm R} \right]} \tag{4.15}\] \[\cdot\] at \[t_{{}_{1/2}}\;\;\left[{\rm R}\right]=\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}}{2} \tag{4.16}\]

So, the above equation becomes

\[k=\frac{2.303}{t_{{}_{1/2}}}\log\frac{\left[{\rm R}\right]_{0}}{\left[{\rm R} \right]/2}\] \[\cdot\] or \[t_{{}_{1/2}}=\frac{2.303}{k}\log 2\] \[\cdot\] \[t_{{}_{1/2}}=\frac{2.303}{k}\times 0.30\,1\] \[\cdot\] \[t_{{}_{1/2}}=\frac{0.693}{k} \tag{4.17}\]

proportion of molecules with much higher energies. The area under the curve must be constant since total probablilty must be one at all times. We can mark the position of \(E_{\text{a}}\) on Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve (Fig. 9).

Increasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction of molecules, which collide with energies greater than \(E_{\text{a}}\). It is clear from the diagram that in the curve at \((t+10)\), the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction.

In the Arrhenius equation (4.18) the factor \(\text{e}^{-\text{E}_{\text{a}}/RT}\) corresponds to the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than \(E_{\text{a}}\). Taking natural logarithm of both sides of equation (4.18)

\[\ln\ k=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT}+\ln\ A \tag{4.19}\]

The plot of \(\ln\ k\) vs 1/T gives a straight line according to the equation (4.19) as shown in Fig. 10.

Thus, it has been found from Arrhenius equation (4.18) that increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy will result in an increase in the rate of the reaction and an exponential increase in the rate constant.

In Fig. 10. slope \(=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R}\) and intercept \(=\ln\ A\). So we can calculate \(E_{\text{a}}\) and \(A\) using these values.

At temperature \(T_{\text{1}}\), equation (4.19) is

\[\ln\ k_{\text{1}}=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{\text{1}}}+\ln\ A \tag{4.20}\]

At temperature \(T_{\text{2}}\), equation (4.19) is

\[\ln\ k_{\text{2}}=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{\text{2}}}+\ln\ A \tag{4.21}\]

(since \(A\) is constant for a given reaction)

\(k_{\text{1}}\) and \(k_{\text{2}}\) are the values of rate constants at temperatures \(T_{\text{1}}\) and \(T_{\text{2}}\) respectively.

Subtracting equation (4.20) from (4.21), we obtain

\[\ln\ k_{\text{2}}-\ln\ k_{\text{1}}=\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{\text{1}}}-\frac {E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{\text{2}}}\]

\[\ln\ k_{\text{2}}=\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R}\bigg{[}\frac{1}{T_{\text{1}}}-\frac {1}{T_{\text{2}}}\bigg{]}\]

\[\log\frac{k_{\text{2}}}{k_{\text{1}}}=\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{2.303R}\bigg{[} \frac{1}{T_{\text{1}}}-\frac{1}{T_{\text{2}}}\bigg{]} \tag{4.22}\]

\[\log\frac{k_{\text{2}}}{k_{\text{1}}}=\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{2.303R}\bigg{[} \frac{T_{\text{2}}-T_{\text{1}}}{T_{\text{1}}T_{\text{2}}}\bigg{]}\]

\[\pm\frac{13}{3}\text{ Chemical Kinetics}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:510]

It is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing the activation energy between reactants and products and hence lowering the potential energy barrier as shown in Fig. 4.11.

It is clear from Arrhenius equation (4.18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction.

A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does not alter Gibbs energy, \(\Delta\Theta\) of a reaction. It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.

### Collision Theory of Chemical Reactions

Theoretical and experimental aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction

\[\text{A}+\text{B}\ \ \rightarrow\ \text{Products}\]

rate of reaction can be expressed as

\[\text{Rate}=Z_{\Delta\Theta}\text{e}^{-E_{\Delta\Theta}/RT} \tag{4.23}\]

where \(Z_{\Delta\Theta}\) represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B and \(\text{e}^{\Delta\Theta/RT}\) represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than \(E_{\Delta}\). Comparing (4.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that A is related to collision frequency.

Equation (4.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions.

Figure 4.11: Effect of catalyst on activation energy

For example, formation of methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 4.12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed.

To account for effective collisions, another factor \(P\), called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,

\[\text{Rate}=\text{PZ}_{\text{A}\text{B}}\text{e}^{-\text{e}_{\text{A}}/R \text{T}}\]

Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.

Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/ molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your higher classes.

_Summary_

Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of intermediates. The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to a

**4.9** 1.462 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\)There are several examples, which reveal that the surface of a solid has the tendency to attract and retain the molecules of the phase with which it comes into contact. These molecules remain only at the surface and do not go deeper into the bulk. The accumulation of molecular species at the surface rather than in the bulk of a solid or liquid is termed adsorption. The molecular species or substance, which concentrates or accumulates at the surface is termed adsorbate and the material on the surface of which the adsorption takes place is called adsorbent.

Adsorption is essentially a surface phenomenon, Solids, particularly in finely divided state, have large surface area and therefore, charcoal, silica gel, alumina gel, clay, colloids, metals in finely divided state, etc. act as good adsorbents.

#### Adsorption in action

1. If a gas like O\({}_{x}\), H\({}_{2}\), CO, Cl\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{3}\) or SO\({}_{2}\) is taken in a closed vessel containing powdered charcoal, it is observed that the pressure of the gas in the enclosed vessel decresses. The gas molecules concentrate at the surface of the charcoal, i.e., gases are adsorbed at the surface.
2. In a solution of an organic dye, say methylene blue, when animal charcoal is added and the solution is well shaken, it is observed that the filtrate turns colourless. The molecules of the dye, thus, accumulate on the surface of charcoal, i.e., are adsorbed.
3. Aqueous solution of raw sugar, when passed over beds of animal charcoal, becomes colourless as the colouring substances are adsorbed by the charcoal.
4. The air becomes dry in the presence of silica gel because the water molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the gel.

It is clear from the above examples that solid surfaces can hold the gas or liquid molecules by virtue of adsorption. The process of removing an adsorbed substance from a surface on which it is adsorbed is called desorption.

#### 5.1.1 Distinction between Adsorption Adsorption and Adsorption

The substance is concentrated only at the surface and does not penetrate through the surface to the bulk of the adsorbent, while in absorption, the substance is uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the solid. For example, when a chalk stick is dipped in ink, the surface retains the colour of the ink due to adsorption of coloured molecules while the solvent of the ink goes deeper into the stick due to absorption. On breaking the chalk stick, it is found to be white from inside. A distinction can be made between absorption and adsorption by taking an example of water vapour. Water vapours are absorbed by anhydrous calcium chloride but adsorbed by silica gel. In other words, in adsorption the concentration of the adsorbate increases only at the surface of the adsorbent, while in absorption the concentration is uniform throughout the bulk of the solid.

Both adsorption and absorption can take place simultaneously also, The term sorption is used to describe both the processes.

Adsorption arises due to the fact that the surface particles of the adsorbent are not in the same environment as the particles inside the bulk. Inside the adsorbent all the forces acting between the particles are mutually balanced but on the surface the particles are not surrounded by atoms or molecules of their kind on all sides, and hence they possess unbalanced or residual attractive forces. These forces of the adsorbent are responsible for attracting the adsorbate particles on its surface.The extent of adsorption increases with the increase of surface area per unit mass of the adsorbent at a given temperature and pressure.

Another important factor featuring adsorption is the heat of adsorption. During adsorption, there is always a decrease in residual forces of the surface, i.e., there is decrease in surface energy which appears as heat. Adsorption, therefore, is invariably an exothermic process. In other words, aH of adsorption is always negative. When a gas is adsorbed, the freedom of movement of its molecules become restricted. This amounts to decrease in the entropy of the gas after adsorption, i.e., AS is negative. Adsorption is thus accompanied by decrease in enthalpy as well as decrease in entropy of the system. For a process to be spontaneous, the thermodynamic requirement is that, at constant temperature and pressure. aG must be negative, i.e., there is a decrease in Gibbs energy. On the basis of equation, aG = aH -TAS, aG can be negative if aH has sufficiently high negative value as -TAS is positive. Thus, in an adsorption process, which is spontaneous, a combination of these two factors makes aG negative. As the adsorption proceeds, aH becomes less and less negative ultimately aH becomes equal to TAS and aG becomes zero. At this state equilibrium is attained.

#### 5.1.3 Types of Adsorption

There are mainly two types of adsorption of gases on solids. If accumulation of gas on the surface of a solid occurs on account of weak van der Waals' forces, the adsorption is termed as physical adsorption or physisorption. When the gas molecules or atoms are held to the solid surface by chemical bonds, the adsorption is termed chemical adsorption or chemisorption. The chemical bonds may be covalent or ionic in nature. Chemisorption involves a high energy of activation and is. therefore, often referred to as activated adsorption. Sometimes these two processes occur simultaneously and it is not easy to ascertain the type of adsorption. A physical adsorption at low temperature may pass into chemisorption as the temperature is increased. For example, dihydrogen is first adsorbed on nickel by van der Waals' forces. Molecules of hydrogen then dissociate to form hydrogen atoms which are held on the surface by chemisorption.

Some of the important characteristics of both types of adsorption are described below:

Characteristics of physisorption

* _Lack of specificity:_ A given surface of an adsorbent does not show any preference for a particular gas as the van der Waals' forces are universal.
* _Nature of adsorbate:_ The amount of gas adsorbed by a solid depends on the nature of gas. In general, easily liquefiable gases (i.e., with higher critical temperatures) are readily adsorbed as van der Waals' forces are stronger near the critical temperatures. Thus, 1g of activated charcoal adsorbs more sulphur dioxide (critical temperature 630K), than methane (critical temperature 190K) which is still more than 4.5 mL of dihydrogen (critical temperature 33K).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:520]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:521]

When \(\frac{1}{n}=0,\frac{X}{m}=\) constant, the adsorption is independent of pressure. When \(\frac{1}{n}=1,\frac{X}{m}=k\,P\), i.e. \(\frac{X}{m}\approx P\), the adsorption varies directly with pressure. Both the conditions are supported by experimental results. The experimental isotherms always seem to approach saturation at high pressure. This cannot be explained by Freundlich isotherm. Thus, it falls at high pressure.

#### 5.1.5 Adsorption from

Solids can adsorb solutes from solutions also. When a solution of acetic acid in water is shaken with charcoal, a part of the acid is adsorbed by the charcoal and the concentration of the acid decreases in the solution. Similarly, the litmus solution when shaken with charcoal becomes colourless. The precipitate of Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) attains blue colour when precipitated in presence of magneson reagent. The colour is due to adsorption of magneson. The following observations have been made in the case of adsorption from solution phase:

1. The extent of adsorption decreases with an increase in temperature.
2. The extent of adsorption increases with an increase of surface area of the adsorbent.
3. The extent of adsorption depends on the concentration of the solute in solution.
4. The extent of adsorption depends on the nature of the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The precise mechanism of adsorption from solution is not known. Freundlich's equation approximately describes the behavlour of adsorption from solution with a difference that instead of pressure, concentration of the solution is taken into account, i.e., \[\frac{X}{m}=k\,C^{1/n}\]... (5.3)

(\(C\) is the equilibrium concentration, i.e., when adsorption is complete). On taking logarithm of the above equation, we have

\[\log\frac{X}{m}=\log k+\frac{1}{n}\,\log C\]... (5.4)

Plotting \(\log\frac{X}{m}\) against \(\log C\) a straight line is obtained which shows the validity of Freundlich isotherm. This can be tested experimentally by taking solutions of different concentrations of acetic acid. Equal volumes of solutions are added to equal amounts of charcoal in different flasks. The final concentration is determined in each flask after adsorption. The difference in the initial and final concentrations give the value of \(X\). Using the above equation, validity of Freundlich isotherm can be established.

#### 5.1.6 Applications of

The phenomenon of adsorption finds a number of applications. Important ones are listed here:

1. _Production of high vacuum_: The remaining traces of air can be adsorbed by charcoal from a vessel evacuated by a vacuum pump to give a very high vacuum.

* _Gas masks_: Gas mask (a device which consists of activated charcoal or mixture of adsorbents) is usually used for breathing in coal mines to adsorb poisonous gases.
* _Control of humidity_: Silica and aluminium gels are used as adsorbents for removing moisture and controlling humidity.
* _Removal of colouring matter from solutions_: Animal charcoal removes colours of solutions by adsorbing coloured impurities.
* _Heterogeneous catalysis_: Adsorption of reactants on the solid surface of the catalysts increases the rate of reaction. There are many gaseous reactions of industrial importance involving solid catalysts. Manufacture of ammonia using iron as a catalyst, manufacture of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\) by contact process and use of finely divided nickel in the hydrogenation of oils are excellent examples of heterogeneous catalysis.
* _Separation of inert gases_: Due to the difference in degree of adsorption of gases by charcoal, a mixture of noble gases can be separated by adsorption on coconut charcoal at different temperatures.
* _In curing diseases_: A number of drugs are used to kill germs by getting adsorbed on them.
* _Froth floatation process_: A low grade sulphide ore is concentrated by separating it from silica and other earthy matter by this method using pine oil and frothing agent (see Unit 6).
* _Adsorption indicators_: Surfaces of certain precipitates such as silver halides have the property of adsorbing some dyes like eosin, fluorescein, etc. and thereby producing a characteristic colour at the end point.
* _Chromatographic analysis_: Chromatographic analysis based on the phenomenon of adsorption finds a number of applications in analytical and industrial fields.

_Interval Questions_

* Why are substances like platinum and palladium often used for carrying out electrolysis of aqueous solutions?
* Why does physisorption decrease with the increase of temperature?
* Why are powdered substances more effective adsorbents than their crystalline forms?

### Catalysis

Potassium chloride, when heated strongly decomposes slowly giving dloxygen. The decomposition occurs in the temperature range of 653-873K.

2KClO\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2KCl + 3O\({}_{2}\)

However, when a little of manganese dioxide is added, the decomposition takes place at a considerably lower temperature range, i.e., 473-633K and also at a much accelerated rate. The added manganese dioxide remains unchanged with respect to its mass and composition. In a similar manner, the rates of a number of chemical reactions can be altered by the mere presence of a foreign substance.
The systematic study of the effect of various foreign substances on the rates of chemical reactions was first made by Berzelius, in 1835. He suggested the term catalyst for such substances.

Substances, which alter the rate of a chemical reaction and themselves remain chemically and quantitatively unchanged after the reaction, are known as catalysts, and the phenomenon is known as catalysts. You have already studied about catalysts and its functioning in Section 4.5.

_Promoters and poisons_

Promoters are substances that enhance the activity of a catalyst while poisons decrease the activity of a catalyst. For example, in Haber's process for manufacture of ammonia. molybdenum acts as a promoter for iron which is used as a catalyst.

N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\frac{\text{Fe(g)}}{\text{Mo(g)}}\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)(g)

5.2.1

Catalysis can be broadly divided into two groups:

_(a) Homogeneous catalysis_

When the reactants and the catalyst are in the same phase (i.e., liquid or gas), the process is said to be homogeneous catalysis. The following are some of the examples of homogeneous catalysis:

_(i)_ Oxidation of sulphur dioxide into sulphur trioxide with dioxygen in the presence of oxides of nitrogen as the catalyst in the lead chamber process.

2SO\({}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\frac{\text{NO(g)}}{\text{NO(g)}}\) 2SO\({}_{3}\)(g)

The reactants, sulphur dioxide and oxygen, and the catalyst. nitric oxide, are all in the same phase.

_(ii)_ Hydrolysis of methyl acetate is catalysed by H' ions furnished by hydrochloric acid.

CH\({}_{3}\)COOCH\({}_{3}\)(l) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\frac{\text{HCl(q)}}{\text{CH}_{3}\)COOH(aq) + CH\({}_{3}\)OH(aq) Both the reactants and the catalyst are in the same phase.

_(iii)_ Hydrolysis of sugar is catalysed by H' ions furnished by sulphuric acid.

C\({}_{1x}\)H\({}_{2x}\)O\({}_{1}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\frac{\text{H}_{2}\)O(l) \(\frac{\text{H}_{2}\)O(l) \(\frac{\text{O}(q)}{\text{Clucose}}\)Fructose Solution

Both the reactants and the catalyst are in the same phase.

_(b)_ _Heterogeneous catalysis_

The catalytic process in which the reactants and the catalyst are in different phases is known as heterogeneous catalysis. Some of the examples of heterogeneous catalysis are given below:

_(i)_ Oxidation of sulphur dioxide into sulphur trioxide in the presence of Pt.

2SO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\frac{\text{Fe(g)}}{\text{Mo(g)}}\) 2SO\({}_{3}\)(g) The reactant is in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.

Chemistry \(\frac{\text{H}_{2}\text{H}_{2}}{\text{Mo(g)}}\) 2SO\({}_{3}\)(g)

The reactants and the catalyst are in the same phase.

_(ii)_ _Heterogeneous catalysis_

The catalytic process in which the reactants and the catalyst are in different phases is known as heterogeneous catalysis.

_(iii)_ Oxidation of sulphur dioxide into sulphur trioxide in the presence of Pt.

2SO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\frac{\text{Fe(g)}}{\text{Mo(g)}}\) 2SO\({}_{3}\)(g) The reactant is in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.

* Combination between dinitrogen and dihydrogen to form ammonia in the presence of finely divided iron in Haber's process. \(N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)\xrightarrow{Fe(g)}2NH_{2}(g)\) The reactants are in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.
* Oxidation of ammonia into nitric oxide in the presence of platinum gauze in Ostwald's process. \(4NH_{3}(g)+5O_{2}(g)\xrightarrow{Fe(g)}4NO(g)+6H_{2}O(g)\) The reactants are in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.
* Hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of finely divided nickel as catalyst. Vegetable oils[] + H_{2}(g)\xrightarrow{Ni(g)}Vegetable ghee(s) One of the reactants is in liquid state and the other in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.

#### 5.2.2 Adsorption Theory

This theory explains the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis. The old theory, known as adsorption theory of catalysis, was that the reactants in gaseous state or in solutions, are adsorbed on the surface of the solid catalyst. The increase in concentration of the reactants on the surface increases the rate of reaction. Adsorption being an exothermic process, the heat of adsorption is utilised in enhancing the rate of the reaction.

The catalytic action can be explained in terms of the intermediate compound formation, the theory of which you have already studied in Section 4.5.1

The modern adsorption theory is the combination of intermediate compound formation theory and the old adsorption theory. The catalytic activity is localised on the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism involves five steps:

* Diffusion of reactants to the surface of the catalyst.
* Adsorption of reactant molecules on the surface of the catalyst.
* Occurrence of chemical reaction on the catalyst's surface through formation of an intermediate (Fig. 5.3).
* Desorption of reaction products from the catalyst surface, and thereby, making the surface available again for more reaction to occur.
* Diffusion of reaction products away from the catalyst's surface. The surface of the catalyst unlike the inner part of the bulk, has free valencies which provide the seat for chemical forces of attraction. When a gas comes in contact with such a surface, its molecules are held up there due to loose chemical combination. If different molecules are adsorbed side by side, they may react with each other resulting in the formation of new molecules. Thus, formed molecules may evaporate leaving the surface for the fresh reactant molecules. This theory explains why the catalyst remains unchanged in mass and chemical composition at the end of the reaction and is effective 
#### 5.2.3 Shape-Selective

The catalytic reaction that depends upon the pore structure of the catalyst and the size of the reactant and product molecules is called shape-selective catalysis. Zeolites are good shape-selective catalysts because of their honeycomb-like structures. They are microporous aluminosilicates with three dimensional network of silicates in which some silicon atoms are replaced by aluminium atoms giving Al-O-Si framework. The reactions taking place in zeolites depend upon the size and shape of reactant and product molecules as well as upon the pores and cavities of the zeolites. They are found in nature as well as synthesised for catalytic selectivity.

Zeolites are being very widely used as catalysts in petrochemical industries for cracking of hydrocarbons and isomerisation. An important zeolite catalyst used in the petroleum industry is ZSM-5. It converts alcohols directly into gasoline (petrol) by dehydrating them to give a mixture of hydrocarbons.

#### 5.2.4 Enzyme Catalysis

Enzymes are complex nitrogenous organic compounds which are produced by living plants and animals. They are actually protein molecules of high molecular mass and form colloidal solutions in water. They are very effective catalysts; catalyse numerous reactions, especially those connected with natural processes. Numerous reactions that occur in the bodies of animals and plants to maintain the life process are catalysed by enzymes. The enzymes are, thus, termed as biochemical catalysts and the phenomenon is known as biochemical catalysis.

Many enzymes have been obtained in pure crystalline state from living cells. However, the first enzyme was synthesised in the laboratory in 1969. The following are some of the examples of enzyme-catalysed reactions:

1. _Inversion of cane sugar_: The invertase enzyme converts cane sugar into glucose and fructose. \(\mathrm{C_{{}_{1}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+H_{{}_{2}}O(0)}\xrightarrow{ \mathrm{Invertase}}\mathrm{C_{{}_{2}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+C_{{}_{1}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)}\) Cane sugar
2. _Conversion of glucose into ethyl alcohol_: The zymase enzyme converts glucose into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. \(\mathrm{C_{{}_{2}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+2C_{{}_{2}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+2C_{{}_{2}}(g)}\) Glucose
3. _Enversion of starch into maltose_: The blastase enzyme converts starch into maltose. \(\mathrm{2(C_{{}_{1}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+H_{{}_{2}}O(1))}\xrightarrow{ \mathrm{Distance}}\mathrm{nC_{{}_{1}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)}\) Starch
4. _Conversion of maltose into glucose_: The maltose enzyme converts maltose into glucose. \(\mathrm{C_{{}_{2}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)+H_{{}_{2}}O(1)}\xrightarrow{ \mathrm{Maluose}}\mathrm{2C_{{}_{3}}H_{{}_{2}}O_{{}_{1}}(aq)}\) Glucose
5. _Decomposition of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide_: The enzyme urease catalyses this decomposition. \(\mathrm{NH_{{}_{2}}CONH_{{}_{2}}(aq)+H_{{}_{2}}O(1)}\xrightarrow{ \mathrm{Urease}}\mathrm{2NH_{{}_{2}}(g)+CO_{{}_{2}}(g)}\)
6. In stomach, the pepsin enzyme converts proteins into peptides while in intestine, the pancreatic trypsin converts proteins into amino acids by hydrolysis.
7. _Conversion of milk into cured_: It is an enzymatic reaction brought about by lacto bacilli enzyme present in cured. \(\mathrm{\frac{133}{4}}\) Surface ChemistryTable 5.2 gives the summary of some important enzymatic reactions.

#### Characteristics of enzyme catalysis

Enzyme catalysis is unique in its efficiency and high degree of specificity. The following characteristics are exhibited by enzyme catalysts:

1. [label=()]
2. _Most highly efficient_: One molecule of an enzyme may transform one million molecules of the reactant per minute.
3. _Highly specific nature_: Each enzyme is specific for a given reaction, i.e., one catalyst cannot catalyse more than one reaction. For example, the enzyme urease catalyses the hydrolysis of urea only. It does not catalyse hydrolysis of any other amide.
4. _Highly active under optimum temperature_: The rate of an enzyme reaction becomes maximum at a definite temperature, called the optimum temperature. On either side of the optimum temperature, the enzyme activity decreases. The optimum temperature range for enzymatic activity is 298-310K. Human body temperature being 310 K is suited for enzyme-catalysed reactions.
5. _Highly active under optimum pH_: The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction is maximum at a particular pH called optimum pH, which is between pH values 5-7.
6. _Increasing activity in presence of activators and co-enzymes_: The enzymatic activity is increased in the presence of certain substances, known as co-enzymes. It has been observed that when a small non-protein (vitamin) is present along with an enzyme, the catalytic activity is enhanced considerably. Activators are generally metal ions such as Na\({}^{*}\), Mn\({}^{2*}\), Co\({}^{2*}\), Cu\({}^{2*}\), etc. These metal ions, when weakly bonded to enzyme molecules, increase their catalytic activity. Amylase in presence of sodium chloride i.e., Na\({}^{*}\) ions are catalytically very active.
7. _Influence of inhibitors and poisons_: Like ordinary catalysts, enzymes are also inhibited or poisoned by the presence of certain substances. The inhibitors or poisons interact with the active functional groups on the enzyme surface and often reduce or completely destroy the catalytic activity of the enzymes. The use of many drugs is related to their action as enzyme inhibitors in the body.

### Mechanism of enzyme catalysis

There are a number of cavities present on the surface of colloidal particles of enzymes. These cavlles are of characteristic shape and possess active groups such as -NH\({}_{2}\), -COOH, -SH, -OH, etc. These are actually the active 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:529]

We have learnt in Unit 2 that solutions are homogeneous systems. We also know that sand in water when stirred gives a suspension, which slowly settles down with time. Between the two extremes of suspensions and solutions we come across a large group of systems called colloidal dispersions or simply colloids.

A colloid is a heterogeneous system in which one substance is dispersed (dispersed phase) as very fine particles in another substance called dispersion medium.

The essential difference be tween a solution and a colloid is that of particle size. While in a solution, the constituent particles are ions or small molecules. In a colloid, the dispersed phase may consist of particles of a single macromolecule (such as protein or synthetic polymer) or an aggregate of many atoms, ions or molecules. Colloidal particles are larger than simple molecules but small enough to remain suspended. Their range of diameters is between 1 and 1000 nm (10\({}^{9}\) to 10\({}^{-6}\) m).

Colloidal particles have an enormous surface area per unit mass as a result of their small size. Consider a cube with 1 cm side. It has a total surface area of 6 cm\({}^{2}\). If it were divided equally into 10\({}^{2}\) cubes, the cubes would be the size of large colloidal particles and have a total surface area of 60,000 cm\({}^{2}\) or 6 m\({}^{2}\). This enormous surface area leads to some special properties of colloids to be discussed later in this Unit.

Colloids are classified on the basis of the following criteria:

* Physical state of dispersed phase and dispersion medium
* Nature of interaction between dispersed phase and dispersion medium
* Type of particles of the dispersed phase.
* Depending upon whether the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium are solids, liquids or gases, eight types of colloidal systems are possible. A gas mixed with another gas forms a homogeneous mixture and hence is not a colloidal system. The examples of the various types of colloids along with their typical names are listed in Table 5.4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Object & Directed & Type of & Example \\ \hline phase & medium & - cytosol & \\ \hline Solid & Solid & Solid sol & Some coloured glasses and gem stones \\ Solid & Liquid & Sol & Paints. cell fluids \\ Solid & Gas & Aerosol & Smoke. dust \\ Liquid & Solid & Gel & Cheese. butter. jellies \\ Liquid & Liquid & Emulsion & Milk. hair cream \\ Liquid & Gas & Aerosol & Fog. mist. cloud. insecticide sprays \\ Gas & Solid & Solid sol & Pumice stone, foam rubber \\ Gas & Liquid & Foam & Froth. whipped cream. soap lather \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:531]

* _Macromolecular colloids_: Macromolecules (Unit 15) in suitable solvents form solutions in which the size of the macromolecules may be in the colloidal range. Such systems are called macromolecular colloids. These colloids are quite stable and resemble true solutions in many respects. Examples of naturally occurring macromolecules are starch, cellulose, proteins and enzymes; and those of man-made macromolecules are polythene, nylon, polystyrene, synthetic rubber, etc.
* _Associated colloids (Micelles)_: There are some substances which at low concentrations behave as normal strong electrolytes, but at higher concentrations exhibit colloidal behaviour due to the formation of aggregates. The aggregated particles thus formed are called micelles. These are also known as associated colloids. The formation of micelles takes place only above a particular temperature called Kraft temperature (T\({}_{k}\)) and above a particular concentration called critical micelle concentration (CMC). On dilution, these colloids revert back to individual ions. Surface active agents such as soaps and synthetic detergents belong to this class. For soaps, the CMC is 10\({}^{+}\) to 10\({}^{+}\) mol L\({}^{-}\). These colloids have both lyopholc and lyopholc parts. Micelles may contain as many as 100 molecules or more.

### Mechanism of micelle formation

Let us take the example of soap solutions. Soap is sodium or potassium salt of a higher fatty acid and may be represented as RCOO'Na' (e.g., sodium stearate CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)COONNa', which is a major component of many bar soaps). When dissolved in water, it dissociates into RCOO' and Na' ions. The RCOO' ions, however, consist of two parts -- a long hydrocarbon chain R (also called non-polar 'tail') which is hydrophobic (water repelling), and a polar group COO' (also called polar-ionic 'head'), which is hydrophilic (water loving).

Figure 5: Hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of stearate ion

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:533]

by this method. In this method, electric arc is struck between electrodes of the metal immersed in the dispersion medium (Fig. 5.8). The intense heat produced vapourises the metal, which then condenses to form particles of colloidal size.

During peptization, the precipitate adsorbs one of the ions of the electrolyte on its surface. This causes the development of positive or negative charge on precipitates, which ultimately break up into smaller particles of the size of a colloid.

Colloidal solutions when prepared, generally contain excessive amount of electrolytes and some other soluble impurities. While the presence of traces of electrolyte is essential for the stability of the colloidal solution, larger quantities coagulate it. It is, therefore, necessary to reduce the concentration of these soluble impurities to a requisite minimum. The process used for reducing the amount of impurities to a requisite minimum is known as purification of colloidal solution. The purification of colloidal solution is carried out by the following methods:

Dialysis

It is a process of removing a dissolved substance from a colloidal solution by means of diffusion through a suitable membrane. Since particles (ions or smaller molecules) in a true solution can pass through animal membrane (bladder) or parchment paper or cellophane sheet but not the colloidal particles, the membrane can be used for dialysis. The apparatus used for this purpose is called **dilayer**. A bag of suitable membrane containing the colloidal solution is suspended in a vessel through which fresh water is continuously flowing (Fig. 5.9). The molecules and ions diffuse through membrane into the outer water and pure colloidal solution is left behind.

Dialysis

Ordinarily, the process of dialysis is quite slow. It can be made faster by applying an electric field if the dissolved substance in the impure colloidal solution is only an electrolyte. The process is then named electrodialysis. The colloidal solution is placed in a bag of suitable membrane while pure water is taken outside. Electrodes are fitted in the compartment as shown in Fig. 5.10. The ions present in the colloidal solution migrate out to the oppositely charged electrodes.

Figure 5.9: Dalysis solution is suspended in a vessel through which fresh water is continuously flowing (Fig. 5.9). The molecules and ions diffuse through membrane into the outer water and pure colloidal solution is left behind.

Figure 5.10: Elecro-dialopsis

* _Ultrafiltration_: Ultrafiltration is the process of separating the colloidal particles from the solvent and soluble solutes present in the colloidal solution by specially prepared filters, which are permeable to all substances except the colloidal particles. Colloidal particles can pass through ordinary filter paper because the pores are too large. However, the pores of filter paper can be reduced in size by impregnating with colloidion solution to stop the flow of colloidal particles. The usual colloidion is a 4% solution of nitrocellulose in a mixture of alcohol and ether. An ultra-filter paper may be prepared by soaking the filter paper in a colloidion solution, hardening by formaldehyde and then finally drying it. Thus, by using ultra-filter paper, the colloidal particles are separated from rest of the materials. Ultrafiltration is a slow process. To speed up the process, pressure or suction is applied. The colloidal particles left on the ultra-filter paper are then stirred with fresh dispersion medium (solvent) to get a pure colloidal solution.

#### 5.4.6. Properties of Colloidal Solutions

* _Colligative properties_: Colloidal particles being bigger aggregates, the number of particles in a colloidal solution is comparatively small as compared to a true solution. Hence, the values of colligative properties (osmotic pressure, lowering in vapour pressure, depression in freezing point and elevation in boiling point) are of small order as compared to values shown by true solutions at same concentrations.
* _Tyndall effect_: If a homogeneous solution placed in dark is observed in the direction of light, it appears clear and, if it is observed from a direction at right angles to the direction of light beam, it appears perfectly dark. Colloidal solutions viewed in the same way may also appear reasonably clear or transluct by the transmitted light but they show a mild to strong opalescence, when viewed at right angles to the passage of light, i.e., the path of the beam is illuminated by a bluish light. This effect was first observed by Faraday and later studied in detail by Tyndall and is termed as Tyndall effect. The bright cone of the light is called Tyndall cone (Fig. 5.11). The Tyndall effect is due to the fact that colloidal particles scatter light in all directions in space. This scattering of light illuminates the path of beam in the colloidal dispersion. Tyndall effect can be observed during the projection of picture in the cinema hall due to scattering of light by dust and smoke particles present there. Tyndall effect is observed only when the following two conditions are satisfied.
* The diameter of the dispersed particles is not much smaller than the wavelength of the light used; and
* The refractive indices of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium differ greatly in magnitude.

Tyndall effect is used to distinguish between a colloidal and true solution. Zsigmondy, in 1903, used Tyndall effect to set up an apparatus known as ultramicroscope. An intense beam of light is focussed on the colloidal solution contained in a glass vessel. The focus of the light is then observed with a microscope at right angles to the beam. Individual colloidal particles appear as bright stars against a dark background. Ultramicroscope does not render the actual colloidal particles visible but only observe the light scattered by them. Thus, ultramicroscope does not provide any information about the size and shape of colloidal particles.
* _Colour:_ The colour of colloidal solution depends on the wavelength of light scattered by the dispersed particles. The wavelength of light further depends on the size and nature of the particles. The colour of colloidal solution also changes with the manner in which the observer receives the light. For example, a mixture of milk and water appears blue when viewed by the reflected light and red when viewed by the transmitted light. Finesst gold sol is red in colour; as the ske of particles increases, it appears purple, then blue and finally golden.
* _Brownian movement:_ When colloidal solutions are viewed under a powerful ultramicroscope, the colloidal particles appear to be in a state of continuous zig-zag motion all over the field of view. This motion was first observed by the British botanist, Robert Brown, and is known as Brownian movement (Fig. 12). This motion is independent of the nature of the colloid but depends on the size of the particles and viscosity of the solution. Smaller the size and lesser the viscosity, faster is the motion. The Brownian movement has been explained to be due to the unbalanced bombardment of the particles by the molecules of the dispersion medium. The Brownian movement has a stirring effect which does not permit the particles to settle and thus, is responsible for the stability of sols.
* _Charge on colloidal particles_: Colloidal particles always carry an electric charge. The nature of this charge is the same on all the particles in a given colloidal solution and may be either positive or negative. A list of some common sols with the nature of charge on their particles is given below:

Figure 12: Brownian movement

The charge on the sol particles is due to one or more reasons, viz., due to electron capture by sol particles during electrodispersion of metals, due to preferential adsorption of ions from solution and/or due to formulation of electrical double layer.

Preferential adsorption of ions is the most accepted reason. The sol particles acquire positive or negative charge by preferential adsorption of +ve or -ve ions. When two or more ions are present in the dispersion medium, preferential adsorption of the ion common to the colloidal particle usually takes place. This can be explained by taking the following examples:

1. When silver nitrate solution is added to potassium iodide solution, the precipitated silver iodide adsorbs iodide ions from the dispersion medium and negatively charged colloidal solution results. However, when KI solution is added to AgNO\({}_{3}\) solution, positively charged sol results due to adsorption of Ag\({}^{*}\) ions from dispersion medium. \(\text{AgI/I}^{*}\) \(\text{AgI/Ag}^{*}\) Negatively charged \(\text{Positively charged}\)
2. If \(\text{FeCl}_{3}\) is added to excess of hot water, a positively charged sol of hydrated ferric oxide is formed due to adsorption of Fe\({}^{3*}\) ions. However, when ferric chloride is added to NaOH a negatively charged sol is obtained with adsorption of OH\({}^{*}\) ions. \(\text{Fe}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\).\(\text{ArH}_{2}\text{O}/\text{Fe}^{3*}\) \(\text{Fe}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\).\(\text{ArH}_{2}\text{O}/\text{OH}^{*}\) Positively charged Negatively charged

Having acquired a positive or a negative charge by selective adsorption on the surface of a colloidal particle as stated above, this layer attracts counter ions from the medium forming a second layer, as shown below. \(\text{AgI/I}^{*}\) \(\text{AgI/Ag}^{*}\)

The combination of the two layers of opposite charges around the colloidal particle is called Helmholtz electrical double layer. According to modern views, the first layer of ions is firmly held and is termed fixed layer while the second layer is mobile which is termed diffused layer. Since separation of charge is a seat of potential, the charges of opposite signs on the fixed and diffused parts of the double layer results in a difference in potential between the base layers. This potential difference between the fixed layer and the diffused layer of opposite charges is called the **electrokinetic potential or zeta potential**.

The presence of equal and similar charges on colloidal particles is largely responsible in providing stability to the colloidal solution, because the repulsive forces between charged particles having same charge prevent them from coalescing or aggregating when they come closer to one another.

1. [label=(vi)]
2. _Electrophoresis:_ The existence of charge on colloidal particles is confirmed by electrophoresis experiment. When electric potential is applied across two platinum electrodes dipping in a colloidal solution, the colloidal particles move towards one or the other electrode. The movement of colloidal particles under an applied electric potential is called electrophoresis. Positively charged particles move towards the cathode while negatively chargedparticles move towards the anode. This can be demonstrated by the following experimental set-up (Fig. 5.13).

When electrophoresis, i.e., movement of particles is prevented by some suitable means, it is observed that the dispersion medium begins to move in an electric field. This phenomenon is termed electroosmosis.

(vil) _Coagulation or precipitation_: The stability of the lyophobic sols is due to the presence of charge on colloidal particles. If, somehow, the charge is removed, the particles will come nearer to each other to form aggregates (or coagulate) and settle down under the force of gravity.

The process of settling of colloidal particles is called coagulation or precipitation of the sol.

The coagulation of the lyophobic sols can be carried out in the following ways:

1. _By electrophoresis_: The colloidal particles move towards oppositely charged electrodes, get discharged and precipitated.
2. _By mixing two oppositely charged sols_: Oppositely charged sols when mixed in almost equal proportions, neutralise their charges and get partially or completely precipitated. Mixing of hydrated ferric oxide (\(\nu\)e sol) and arsenolus sulphide [\(\nu\)e sol) bring them in the precipitated forms. This type of coagulation is called mutual coagulation.
3. _By boiling_: When a sol is boiled, the adsorbed layer is disturbed due to increased collisions with the molecules of dispersion medium. This reduces the charge on the particles and ultimately lead to settling down in the form of a precipitate.
4. _By persistent dialysis_: On prolonged dialysis, traces of the electrolyte present in the sol are removed almost completely and the colloids become unstable and ultimately coagulate.
5. _By addition of electrolytes_: When excess of an electrolyte is added, the colloidal particles are precipitated. The reason is that colloids interact with ions carrying charge opposite to that present on themselves. This causes neutralisation leading to their coagulation. The ion responsible for neutralisation of charge on the particles is called the coagulating ion. A negative ion causes the precipitation of positively charged sol and vice versa.

It has been observed that, generally, the greater the valence of the flocculating ion added, the greater is its power to cause precipitation. This is known as Hardy-Schulze rule. In the coagulation of a negative sol, the flocculating power is in the order: \(\mathrm{AF}^{*}\)>\(\mathrm{Ba}^{*}\)>\(\mathrm{Na}^{*}\)

Similarly, in the coagulation of a positive sol, the flocculating power is in the order: \(\mathrm{[Fe(CN)]}^{*}\) > \(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{*}\) > \(\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{*}\) > \(\mathrm{Cl}^{*}\)

The minimum concentration of an electrolyte in millimoles per litre required to cause precipitation of a sol in two hours is called coagulating value. The smaller the quantity needed, the higher will be the coagulating power of an ion.

Figure 5.13: Electrophoresis

#### Coagulation of lyophiEcols

There are two factors which are responsible for the stability of lyophilic sols. These factors are the charge and solvation of the colloidal particles. When these two factors are removed, a lyophilic sol can be coagulated. This is done (i) by adding an electrolyte and (ii) by adding a suitable solvent. When solvents such as alcohol and acetone are added to hydrophilic sols, the dehydration of dispersed phase occurs. Under this condition, a small quantity of electrolyte can bring about coagulation.

#### Protection of colloids

Lyophilic sols are more stable than lyophobic sols. This is due to the fact that lyophilic colloids are extensively solvated, i.e., colloidal particles are covered by a sheath of the liquid in which they are dispersed.

Lyophilic colloids have a unique property of protecting lyophobic colloids. When a lyophilic sol is added to the lyophobic sol, the lyophilic particles form a layer around lyophobic particles and thus protect the latter from electrolytes. Lyophilic colloids used for this purpose are called protective colloids.

### 5.5. _Cunlusions_

These are liquid-liquid colloidal systems, i.e., the dispersion of finely divided droplets in another liquid. If a mixture of two immiscible or partially miscible liquids is shaken, a coarse dispersion of one liquid in the other is obtained which is called emulsion. Generally, one of the two liquids is water. There are two types of emulsions.

(i) Oil dispersed in water (O/W type) and (ii) Water dispersed in oil (W/O type).

In the first system, water acts as dispersion medium. Examples of this type of emulsion are milk and vanishing cream. In milk, liquid fat is dispersed in water. In the second system, oil acts as dispersion medium. Common examples of this type are butter and cream.

Emulsions of oil in water are unstable and sometimes they separate into two layers on standing. For stabilisation of an emulsion, a third component called emulsifying agent is usually added. The emulsifying agent forms an interfacial film between suspended particles and the medium. The principal emulsifying agents for O/W emulsions are proteins, gums, natural and synthetic soaps, etc., and for W/O, heavy metal salts of fatty acids, long chain alcohols, lampblack, etc.

Emulsions can be diluted with any amount of the dispersion medium. On the other hand, the dispersed liquid when mixed, forms a separate layer. The droplets in emulsions are often negatively charged and can be precipitated by electrolytes. They also show Brownian movement and Tyndall effect. Emulsions can be broken into constituent liquids by heating, freezing, centrifuging, etc.

### 5.6. _Colloids_

Most of the substances, we come across in our daily life, are colloids. The meals we eat, the clothes we wear, the wooden furniture we use, the houses we live in, the newspapers we read, are largely composed of colloids.

[FIGURE:S5.F14][ENDFIG

Figure 5.14.: Types of emulsionsFollowing are the interesting and noteworthy examples of colloids:

1. _Blue colour of the sky:_ Dust particles along with water suspended in air scatter blue light which reaches our eyes and the sky looks blue to us.
2. _Fog. mist and rain:_ When a large mass of air containing dust particles, is cooled below its dewpoint, the moisture from the air condenses on the surfaces of these particles forming fine droplets. These droplets being colloidal in nature continue to float in air in the form of mist or fog. Clouds are aerosols having small droplets of water suspended in air. On account of condensation in the upper atmos sphere, the colloidal droplets of water grow bigger and bigger in size, till they come down in the form of rain. Sometimes, the rainfall occurs when two oppositely charged clouds meet. It is possible to cause artificial rain by throwing electrified sand or spraying a sol carrying charge opposite to the one on clouds from an aeroplane.
3. _Food articles:_ Milk, butter, halwa, ice creams, fruit juices, etc., are all colloids in one form or the other.
4. _Blood:_ It is a colloidal solution of an albuminoid substance. The styptic action of alum and ferric chloride solution is due to coagulation of blood forming a clot which stops further bleeding.
5. _Sols:_ Fertile soils are colloidal in nature in which humus acts as a protective colloid. On account of colloidal nature, soils adsorb moisture and nonwhsing materials.
6. _Formation of delta:_ River water is a colloidal solution of clay. Sea water contains a number of electrolytes. When river water meets the sea water, the electrolytes present in sea water coagulate the colloidal solution of clay resulting in its deposition with the formation of delta.

#### Applications of colloids

Colloids are widely used in the industry. Following are some examples:

1. _Electrical precipitation of smoke:_ Smoke is a colloidal solution of solid particles such as carbon, arsenic compounds, dust, etc., in air. The smoke, before it comes out from the chimney, is led through a chamber containing plates having a charge opposite to that carried by smoke particles. The particles on coming in contact with these plates lose their charge and get precipitated. The particles thus settle down on the floor of the chamber. The precipitator is called Cottrell precipitator (Fig.5.15).
2. _Purification of drinking water:_ The water obtained from natural sources often contains suspended impurities.
3. _Alum is added to such water to coagulate the suspended carbon_ impurities and make water fit for drinking purposes.
4. _Medicines:_ Most of the medicines are colloidal in nature. For example, argyrol is a silver sol used as an eye lottin. Colloidal antimony is used in curing kalaazar. Colloidal gold is used for intramuscular injection. Milk of magnesia, an emulsion, is used for stomach disorders. Colloidal medicines are more effective because they have large surface area and are therefore easily assimilated.

Figure 5.15: Cottrell smoke precipitator

* _Tanning_: Animal hides are colloidal in nature. When a hide, whch has positively charged particles, is soaked in tannin, which contains negatively charged colloidal particles, mutual coagulation takes place. This results in the hardening of leather. This process is termed as tannin. Chromlum salts are also used in place of tannin.
* _Cleansing action of soaps and detergents_: This has already been described in Section 5.4.3.
* _Photographic plates and films_: Photographic plates or films are prepared by coating an emulsion of the light sensitive silver bromide in gelatin over glass plates or celluloid films.
* _Rubber industry_: Latexls a colloidal solution of rubber particles which are negatively charged. Rubber is obtained by coagulation of latex.
* _Industrial products_: Paints, links, synthetic plastics, rubber, graphite lubricants, cement, etc., are all colloidal solutions.

_Summary_

**Adsorption** is the phenomenon of attracting and retaining the molecules of a substance on the surface of a solid resulting into a higher concentration on the surface than in the bulk. The substance adsorbed is known as adsorbate and the substance on which adsorption takes place is called adsorbent. In physisorption, adsorbate is held to the adsorbent by weak van der Waals forces, and in chemisorption. adsorbate is held to the adsorbent by strong chemical bond. Almost all solids adsorb gases. The extent of adsorption of a gas on a solid depends upon nature of gas nature of solid surface area of the solid. Pressure of gas and temperature of gas. The relationship between the extent of adsorption (x/ml and pressure of the gas at constant temperature is known as adsorption isotherm. A catalyst is a substance which enhances the rate of a chemical reaction without itself getting used up in the reaction. The phenomenon using catalyst is known as catalysis. In homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst is in the same phase as are the reactants, and in heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase from that of the reactants.

**Colloidal solutions** are intermediate between true solutions and suspensions. The size of the colloidal particles range from 1 to 1000 nm. A colloidal system consists of two phases - the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. Colloidal systems are classified in three ways depending upon (ii) physical states of the dispersed phase and dispersion medium (iii) nature of interaction between the dispersed phase and dispersion medium and (iii) nature of particles of dispersed phase. The colloidal systems show interesting optical, mechanical and electrical properties. The process of changing the colloidal particles in a sol into the insoluble precipitate by addition of some suitable electrolytes is known as coagulation. Emulsions are colloidal systems in which both dispersed phase and dispersion medium are liquids. These can be of (iii) **will** in water type and (iii) **water** in oil type. The process of making emulsion is known as emulsification. To stabilise an emulsion. an emulsifying agent or emulsifier is added. Soaps and detergents are most frequently used as emulsifiers. Colloids find several applications in industry as well as in daily life.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

* explain the terms minerals, ones, concentration, benefaction, calcination, roasting, refining, etc.;

A few elements like carbon, sulphur, gold and noble gases, occur in free state while others in combined forms in the earth's crust. The extraction and isolation of an element from its combined form involves various principles of chemistry. A particular element may occur in a variety of compounds, The process of metallurgy and isolation should be such that it is chemically feasible and commercially viable. Still, some general principles are common to all the extraction processes of metals. For obtaining a particular metal, first we look for minerals which are naturally occurring chemical substances in the earth's crust obtainable by mining. Out of many minerals in which a metal may be found, only a few are viable to be used as sources of that metal. Such minerals are known as ones.

Rarely, an ore contains only a desired substance. It is usually contaminated with earthly or undesired materials known as gangue. The extraction and isolation of metals from ores involve the following major steps:

* Concentration of the ore,
* Isolation of the metal from its concentrated ore, and
* Purification of the metal.

The entire scientific and technological process used for isolation of the metal from its ores is known as metallurgy.

In the present Unit, first we shall describe various steps for effective concentration of ones. After that we shall discuss the principles of some of the common metallurgical processes. Those principles shall include the thermodynamic and electrochemical aspects involved in the effective reduction of the concentrated ore to the metal.

Elements vary in abundance. Among metals, aluminum is the most abundant. It is the third most abundant element in earth's crust (8.3% approx. by weight). It is a major component of many igneous minerals including mica and clays. Many gemstones are impure forms of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and the impurities range from Cr (in 'ruby') to Co (in'sapphire'). Iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth's crust. It forms a variety of compounds and their various uses make it a very important element. It is one of the essential elements in biological systems as well.

The principal ones of aluminum, iron, copper and zinc have been given in Table 6.1.

For the purpose of extraction, banxtite is chosen for aluminium. For iron, usually the oxide ores which are abundant and do not produce polluting gases (like SO\({}_{2}\) that is produced in case iron pyritles) are taken. For copper and zinc, any of the listed ores (Table 6.1) may be used depending upon availability and other relevant factors. Before proceeding for concentration, ores are graded and crushed to reasonable size.

#### 6.2.1 Hydraulic Washing

This is based on the differences in gravities of the ore and the _gangue_ particles. It is therefore a type of _gravity separation_. In one such process,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Model & Ores & Ores & Ores \\ \hline Aluminium & Bauxite & AlO\({}_{3}\)[OH]\({}_{32}\)x \\  & Kaolinite [a form of clay] & [where O \(<\) x \(<\) 1] \\ Iron & Haematite & Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) \\  & Magnetite & Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) \\  & Sidreite & FeCO\({}_{3}\) \\  & Iron pyritles & FeS\({}_{2}\) \\ Copper & Copper pyritles & CuFeS\({}_{2}\) \\  & Malachite & CuCO\({}_{3}\).Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) \\  & Cuprite & Cu\({}_{2}\)O \\  & Copper glance & Cu\({}_{2}\)S \\ Zinc & Zinc blende or Sphalerite & ZnS \\  & Calamine & ZnCO\({}_{3}\) \\  & Zncite & ZnO \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6.1: Principal Ores of Some Important Metalsan upward stream of running water is used to wash the powdered ore. The lighter gangue particles are washed away and the heavier ores are left behind.

#### 6.2.2 Magnetic

This is based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore components. If either the ore or the gangue (one of these two) is capable of being attracted by a magnetic field, then such separations are carried out (e.g., in case of iron ores). The ground ore is carried on a conveyer belt which passes over a magnetic roller (Fig.6.1).

#### 6.2.3 Froth

This method has been in use for removing gauge from sulphide ores. In this process, a suspension of the powdered ore is made with water. To it, _collectors_ and _froth stabilisers_ are added. Collectors (e. g., pine oils, fatty acids, xanthates, etc.) enhance non-wetability of the mineral particles and froth stabilisers (e. g., cresols, aniline) stabilise the froth.

The mineral particles become wet by oils while the gangue particles by water. A rotating paddle agitates the mixture and draws air in it. As a result, froth is formed which carries the mineral particles. The froth is light and is skimmed off. It is then dried for recovery of the ore particles.

Sometimes, it is possible to separate two sulphide ores by adjusting proportion of oil to water or by using _'depressants'_. For example, in case of an ore containing ZnS and PBS, the depressant used is NaCl. It selectively prevents ZnS from coming to the froth but allows PBS to come with the froth.

### The Innovative Waslenoman

One can do wonders if he or she has a scientific temperament and is attentive to observations. A washerwoman had an innovative mind too. While washing a miner's overalls, he noticed that sand and similar dirt fell to the bottom of the washtub. What was peculiar, the copper bearing compounds that had come to the clothes from the mines, were caught in the soapsuds and so they came to the top. One of her clients was a chemist, Mrs, Carrie Everson, The washerwoman told her experience to Mrs, Everson. The latter thought that the idea could be used for separating copper compounds from rocky and earth materials on large scale. This way an invention was born. At that time only those ores were used for extraction of copper, which contained large amounts of the metal, Invention of the _Proth Flootation Method_ made copper mining profitable even from the low-grade ores. World production of copper soared and the metal became cheaper.

#### 6.2.4 Leaching

Leaching is often used if the ore is soluble in some suitable solvent. The following examples illustrate the procedure:

1. _Leaching of alumina from baucite_ The principal ore of aluminium, auxcite, usually contains SiO\({}_{2}\), iron oxides and titanium oxide (T\(\mathrm{O}_{2}\)) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at \(473-523\) K and \(35-36\) bar pressure. This way, Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is leached out as sodium aluminate (and SiO\({}_{2}\) too as sodium silicate) leaving the impurities behind: \[\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{s})+2\mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{aq})+3\mathrm{ H}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})\to 2\mathrm{NaAl}(\mathrm{OH})\,\mathrm{J}(\mathrm{aq})\] (6.1) The aluminate in solution is neutralised by passing CO\({}_{2}\) gas and hydrated Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is precipitated. At this stage, the solution is seeded with freshly prepared samples of hydrated Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) which induces the precipitation: \[2\mathrm{Na}[\mathrm{Al}\mathrm{OH}]_{3}[\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{CO}_{2}( \mathrm{g})\to\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{xH}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s })+2\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\,\mathrm{(aq)}\] (6.2) The sodium silicate remains in the solution and hydrated alumina is filtered, dried and heated to give back pure Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\): \[\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}.\mathrm{xH}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})\xrightarrow{ 1470.8}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{xH}_{2}\mathrm{O}( \mathrm{g})\] (6.3)
2. _Other examples_ In the metallurgy of silver and that of gold, the respective metal is leached with a dilute solution of NaCl or KCN in the presence of air (for O\({}_{2}\)) from which the metal is obtained later by replacement: \[4\mathrm{M}(\mathrm{s})+8\mathrm{C}\mathrm{N}^{\prime}(\mathrm{aq})+2\mathrm{ H}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{g})\to 4[\mathrm{M}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\Gamma( \mathrm{aq})+4\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{aq})(\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{Ag}\mathrm{or}\mathrm{ Au})\] (6.4) \[2\mathrm{[M}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}\Gamma(\mathrm{aq})+2\mathrm{ Zn}(\mathrm{s})\to\mathrm{[Zn}(\mathrm{CN})_{4}\Gamma^{2}-(\mathrm{aq})+2\mathrm{M}( \mathrm{s})\] (6.5)

1. _Calcination_: Calcinaton involves heating when the volatile matter escapes leaving behind the metal oxide: \[\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}.\mathrm{xH}_{2}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})\xrightarrow{ \mathrm{a}}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{xH}_{2}\mathrm{O }(\mathrm{g})\] (6.6) \[\mathrm{Zn}\mathrm{CO}_{3}(\mathrm{s})\xrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{Zn} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{g})\] (6.7) \[\mathrm{Ca}\mathrm{CO}_{3}.\mathrm{MgO}\mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{Ca}\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{MgO}( \mathrm{s})+2\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{g})\] (6.8)* _Roasting_: In roasting, the ore is heated in a regular supply of air in a furnace at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. Some of the reactions involving sulphide ores are: \[2ZnS+3O_{2}\to 2ZnO+2SO_{2}\] (6.9) \[2PbS+3O_{2}\to 2PbO+2SO_{2}\] (6.10) \[2Cu_{2}S+3O_{2}\to 2Cu_{2}O+2SO_{2}\] (6.11) The sulphide ores of copper are heated in reverberatory furnace. If the ore contains iron, it is mixed with silica before heating, Iron oxide'slags of' as iron silicate and copper is produced in the form of copper _mante_ which contains Cu\({}_{2}\)S and FeS. \[FeO+SiO_{2}\to FeSiO_{3}\] (6.12) \[\{\rm{slag}\}\] The SO\({}_{2}\) produced is utilised for manufacturing H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).
* _Reduction of oxide to the metal_ Reduction of the metal oxide usually involves heating it with some other substance acting as a reducing agent (C or CO or even another metal). The reducing agent (e.g., carbon) combines with the oxygen of the metal oxide. \[M_{\rm{s}}O_{\rm{y}}+{\rm{y}}C\to xM+yCO\] (6.13) Some metal oxides get reduced easily while others are very difficult to be reduced (reduction means electron gain or electronation). In any case, heating is required. To understand the variation in the temperature requirement for thermal reductions (_pyrometalurgy_) and to predict which element will suit as the reducing agent for a given metal oxide (M\({}_{\rm{s}}\)O), Gibbs energy interpretations are made.
* product' system at the temperature.T. A negative \(\Delta G\) implies a +ve K in equation 6.15. And this can happen only when reaction proceeds towards products. From these facts we can make the following conclusions: * _During metalurgy_. _Jlux is added which combines with 'yangue' to form'slag'. _Stag separates more easily from the ore than the garbage. This way, removal of garbage becomes easier._ * _General Principles and Processes of Isolation of Elements

Figure 6.3: A section of a modern reverberatory furnace

1. When the value of \(\Delta\)G is negative in equation 6.14, only then the reaction will proceed. If \(\Delta\)S is positive, on increasing the temperature (T), the value of TAS would increase (\(\Delta\)H < TAS) and then \(\Delta\)G will become -ve.
2. If reactants and products of two reactions are put together in a system and the net \(\Delta\)G of the two possible reactions is -ve, the overall reaction will occur. So the process of interpretation involves coupling of the two reactions, getting the sum of their \(\Delta\)G and looking for its magnitude and _sign_. Such coupling is easily understood through Gibbs energy (\(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\)) vs T plots for formation of the oxides (Fig. 6.4).

### Clilingham Diagram

The graphical representation of Gibbs energy was first used by H.J.T.Ellingham. This provides a sound basis for considering the choice of reducing agent in the reduction of oxides. This is known as Ellingham Diagram. Such diagrams help us in predicting the feasibility of thermal reduction of an ore. The criterion of feasibility is that at a given temperature. Gibbs energy of the reaction must be negative.

1. Ellingham diagram normally consists of plots of \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) vs T for formation of oxides of elements i.e., for the reaction. 2xM(s) + O,g[g] \(\to\) 2M,O[s] In this reaction, the gaseous amount (hence molecular randomness) is decreasing from left to right due to the consumption of gases leading to a -ve value of \(\Delta\)S which changes the sign of the second term in equation (6.14). Subsequently \(\Delta\)G shifts towards higher side despite rising T (normally, \(\Delta\)G decreases i.e., goes to lower side with increasing temperature). The result is +ve slope in the curve for most of the reactions shown above for formation of M,O[s].
2. Each plot is a straight line except when some change in phase (s\(\rightarrow\)liq or liq\(\rightarrow\)g takes place. The temperature at which such change occurs, is indicated by an increase in the slope on +ve side [e.g., in the Zn, ZnO plot, the melting is indicated by an abrupt change in the curve].
3. There is a point in a curve below which \(\Delta\)G is negative (So M,O is stable). Above this point, M,O will decompose on its own.
4. In an Ellingham diagram. the plots of \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) for oxidation (and therefore reduction of the corresponding species) of common metals and some reducing agents are given. The values of \(\Delta\),G\({}^{\circ}\), etc.(for formation of oxides) at different temperatures are depicted which make the interpretation easy.
5. Similar diagrams are also constructed for sulfides and halides and it becomes clear why reductions of M,S is difficult. There, the \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) of M,S is not compensated.

### Limitations of Ellingham Diagram

1. The graph simply indicates whether a reaction is possible or not i.e., the tendency of reduction with a reducing agent is indicated. This is so because it is based only on the thermodynamic concepts. It does not say about the kinetics of the reduction process (Cannot answer questions like how fast it could be?).
2. The interpretation of \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) is based on K (\(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) = - RT lnK). Thus it is presumed that the reactants and products are in equilibrium: M,O + A\({}_{\rm red}\) = XM + A\(\Omega_{\rm m}\) This is not always true because the reactant/product may be solid. [However it explains how the reactions are sluggish when every species is in solid state and smooth when Chemistry \(\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{ \underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{ \underline{\underline{ \underline{ \underline }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\) 152\({\)1}52\).

the ore melts down.It is interesting to note here that AH (enthalpy change) and the AS (entropy change) values for any chemical reaction remain nearly constant even on varying temperature. So the only dominant variable in equation(6.14) becomes T. However, AS depends much on the physical state of the compound. Since entropy depends on disorder or randomness in the system, it will increase if a compound melts [8\(\rightarrow\)I] or vapourises [I\(\rightarrow\)g] since molecular randomness increases on changing the phase from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas].

The reducing agent forms its oxide when the metal oxide is reduced. The role of reducing agent is to provide \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) negative and large enough to make the sum of \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) of the two reactions (oxidation of the reducing agent and reduction of the metal oxide) negative.

As we know, during reduction, the oxide of a metal decomposes:

M\({}_{\text{t}}\)O(s) \(\rightarrow\) xM (solid or liq) + \(\frac{1}{2}\,\text{O}_{2}\) (g)

The reducing agent takes away the oxygen. Equation 6.16 can be visualised as reverse of the oxidation of the metal. And then, the \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) value is written in the usual way:

xM(s or l) + \(\frac{1}{2}\,\text{O}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) M\({}_{\text{x}}\)O(s) [AG\({}^{\circ}\)\({}_{\text{M,MgO}}\)]

If reduction is being carried out through equation 6.16, the oxidation of the reducing agent (e.g., C or CO) will be there:

C(s) + \(\frac{1}{2}\,\text{O}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO(g) [AG\({}_{\text{C},\,\text{CO}_{2}}\)]

CO(g) + \(\frac{1}{2}\,\text{O}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) [AG\({}_{\text{C},\,\text{CO}_{2}}\)]

If carbon is taken, there may also be complete oxidation of the element to CO\({}_{2}\):

\[\frac{1}{2}\,\text{C}\text{(s) + }\frac{1}{2}\,\text{O}_{2}\text{(g) }\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}\,\text{CO}_{2}\text{(g) }\text{ }\

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:550]

(C,CO) goes downward. At temperatures above \(1\,073\)K (approx.), the C.CO line comes below the Fe.FeO line [\(\Delta G_{\rm{C,CO}}\)! \(\Delta G_{\rm{Fe,CO}}\)]. So in this range, coke will be reducing the FeO and will itself be oxidised to CO. In a similar way the reduction of Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\) and Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) at relatively lower temperatures by CO can be explained on the basis of lower lying points of intersection of their curves with the CO, CO\({}_{2}\) curve in Fig. 4.

In the Blast furnace, reduction of iron oxides takes place in different temperature ranges. Hot air is blown from the bottom of the furnace and coke is burnt to give temperature upto about \(220\)K in the lower portion itself. The burning of coke therefore supplies most of the heat required in the process. The CO and heat moves to upper part of the furnace. In upper part, the temperature is lower and the Iron oxides (Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\)) coming from the top are reduced in steps to FeO. Thus, the reduction reactions taking place in the lower temperature range and in the higher temperature range, depend on the points of corresponding intersections in the \(\Delta G^{0}\) vs T plots. These reactions can be summarised as follows:

At \(500-800\) K (lower temperature range in the blast furnace)-

\[3\;{\rm Fe_{2}O_{3}}+{\rm CO}\to 2\;{\rm Fe_{3}O_{4}}+{\rm CO_{2}} \tag{6.28}\] \[{\rm Fe_{3}O_{4}}+4\;{\rm CO}\to 3{\rm Fe}+4\;{\rm CO_{2}}\] (6.29) \[{\rm Fe_{2}O_{3}}+{\rm CO}\to 2{\rm FeO}+{\rm CO_{2}} \tag{6.30}\]

FeS\({}_{2}\), FeO and Cu\({}_{2}\)S/Cu\({}_{2}\)O to the metallic copper. Following reactions take place:

2FeS + 3O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2FeO + 2SO\({}_{2}\) (6.37) FeO + SiO\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) FeSO\({}_{3}\) (6.38) 2Cu\({}_{2}\)S + 3O\({}_{2}\) 2Cu\({}_{2}\)O + 2SO\({}_{2}\) (6.39) 2Cu\({}_{2}\)O + Cu\({}_{2}\)S \(\rightarrow\) 6Cu + SO\({}_{2}\) (6.40) The solidified copper obtained has blistered appearance due to the evolution of SO\({}_{2}\) and so it is called _blister copper_.
* _Extraction of zinc from zinc oxide_ The reduction of zinc oxide is done using coke. The temperature in this case is higher than that in case of copper.

* _Is it true that under certain conditions, Mg can reduce SiO\({}_{2}\) and Si can reduce MgO? What are those conditions?

### 6.5 _Electrochemical Principles of Hellallurgy_

We have seen how principles of thermodynamics are applied to pyrometallurgy. Similar principles are effective in the reductions of metal ions in solution or molten state. Here they are reduced by electrolysis or by adding some reducing element.

In the reduction of a molten metal salt, electrolysis is done. Such methods are based on electrochemical principles which could be understood through the equation,

\[\mathrm{\Delta G^{\circ}=-nE^{\circ}F} \tag{6.42}\]

here n is the number of electrons and E\({}^{\circ}\) is the electrode potential of the redox couple formed in the system. More reactive metals have large negative values of the electrode potential. So their reduction is difficult. If the difference of two E\({}^{\circ}\) values corresponds to a positive E\({}^{\circ}\) and consequently negative \(\mathrm{\Delta G^{\circ}}\) in equation 6.42, then the less reactive metal will come out of the solution and the more reactive metal will go to the solution, e.g.,

\[\mathrm{Cu^{2*}\ (aq)+Fe(s)\rightarrowCu(s)+Fe^{2*}\ (aq)} \tag{6.43}\]

In simple electrolysis, the M\({}^{\mathrm{m}}\) ions are discharged at negative electrodes (cathodes) and deposited there. Precautions are taken considering the reactivity of the metal produced and suitable materials are used as electrodes. Sometimes a flux is added for making the molten mass more conducting.

In the metallurgy of aluminium, purified Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is mixed with Na\({}_{6}\) or CaF\({}_{2}\) which lowers the melting point of the mix and brings conductivity. The fused matrix is electrolysed. Steel cathode and graphite anode are used. The graphite anode is useful here for reduction to the metal. The overall reaction may be taken as: 2Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) + 3C \(\rightarrow\) 4Al + 3CO\({}_{2}\) (6.44)

This process of electrolysis is widely known as _Hall-Heroult_ process.

The electrolysis of the molten mass is carried out in an electrolytic cell using carbon electrodes. The oxygen liberated at anode reacts with the carbon of anode producing CO and CO\({}_{2}\). This way for each kg of aluminium produced, about 0.5 kg of carbon anode is burnt away. The electrolytic reactions are: Cathode: Al\({}^{+}\) (melt) + 3e\({}^{-}\) Al(I) (6.45)

C(s) + O\({}^{2}\) (melt) \(\rightarrow\) CO(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\) (6.46)

C(s) + 2O\({}^{2}\) (melt) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 4e\({}^{-}\) (6.47)

_Copper from Low Grade Ores and Scraps_

Copper is extracted by _hydrometallurgy_ from low grade ores. It is leached out using acid or bacteria. The solution containing Cu\({}^{2+}\)is treated with scrap iron or H\({}_{2}\) (equations 6.42; 6.48).

Cu\({}^{2+}\)[aq] + H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) (6.48)

At a site, low grade copper ores are available and zinc and iron scraps are also available. Which of the two scraps would be more suitable for reducing the leached copper ore and why?

Since being above iron in the electrochemical series (more reactive metal is zinc), the reduction will be faster in case zinc scraps are used. But zinc is costlier metal than iron so using iron scraps will be advisable and advantageous.

### Oxidation Reduction

Besides reductions, some extractions are based on oxidation particularly for non-metals. A very common example of extraction based on oxidation is the extraction of chlorine from brine (chlorine is abundant in sea water as common salt).

2C[aq] + 2H\({}_{2}\)O[q] \(\rightarrow\) 2OH[aq] + H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Cl\({}_{2}\)(g)

The \(\Delta\)G\({}^{o}\) for this reaction is + 422 kJ. When it is converted to E\({}^{o}\) (using \(\Delta\)G\({}^{o}\) = - nE\({}^{o}\)F), we get E\({}^{o}\) = - 2.2 V. Naturally, it will require an external e.m.f. that is greater than 2.2 V. But the electrolysis requires an excess potential to overcome some other hindering reactions. Thus, Cl\({}_{2}\) is obtained by electrolysis giving out H\({}_{2}\) and aqueous NaOH as byproducts. Electrolysis of molten NaCl is also carried out. But in that case. Na metal is produced and not NaOH.

As studied earlier, extraction of gold and silver involves leaching the metal with CN. This is also an oxidation reaction (Ag \(\rightarrow\)Ag\({}^{\prime}\) or Au \(\rightarrow\) Au\({}^{\prime}\)). The metal is later recovered by displacement method.

\[4\text{Au(s) + }8\text{CN}^{*}\text{(aq) + }2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(aq) + O}_{2}\text{(g) }\rightarrow\] \[4\text{[Au(CN)}_{2}\text{[aq) + }4\text{OH}\text{(aq)} \tag{6.50}\]

\[2\text{[Au(CN)}_{2}\text{[aq) + Zn(s) \to 2\text{Au(s) + }[Zn(CN)}_{i}\text{]}^{2-}\text{(aq)} \tag{6.51}\]

In this reaction zinc acts as a reducing agent.

### 6.7 Refining

A metal extracted by any method is usually contaminated with some impurity. For obtaining metals of high purity, several techniques are used depending upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurity. Some of them are listed below.

* Distillation (b) Liquid (c) Electrolysis (d) Zone refining (e) Vapour phase refining (f) Chromatographic methods These are described in detail here.
* Distillation This is very useful for low boiling metals like zinc and mercury. The impure metal is evaporated to obtain the pure metal as distillate.
* Liquid In this method a low melting metal like tin can be made to flow on a sloping surface. In this way it is separated from higher melting impurities.
* Electrolytic refining In this method, the impure metal is made to act as anode. A strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. They are put in a suitable electrolytic bath containing soluble salt of the same metal. The more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud. This process is also explained using the concept of electrode potential, over potential, and Gibbs energy which you have seen in previous sections. The reactions are: Anode: \[\text{M}\rightarrow\text{M}^{n}\text{ + ne}^{-}\] (6.52) Cathode: \[\text{M}^{n}\text{ + ne}^{-}\to\text{M}\] (6.53) Copper is refined using an electrolytic method. Anodes are of impure copper and pure copper strips are taken as cathode. The electrolyte is acidified solution of copper sulphate and the net result of electrolysis is the transfer of copper in pure form from the anode to the cathode: Anode: \[\text{Cu}\rightarrow\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{ + }2\text{ e}^{-}\] (6.54) Cathode: \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{ + }2\text{ e}^{-}\rightarrow\text{Cu}\] (6.55) Impurites from the blister copper deposit as anode mud which contains antimony, selenium, tellurium, silver, gold and platinum; recovery of these elements may meet the cost of refining. Zinc may also be refined this way.
* _Zone refining_ This method is based on the principle that the impurities are more soluble in the melt than in the solid state of the metal. A circular mobile heater is fixed at one end of a rod of the impure metal (Fig. 6.7). The molten zone moves along with the heater which is moved forward. As the heater moves forward, the pure metal crystallises out of the melt and the impurities pass on into the adjacent molten zone. The process is repeated several times and the heater is moved in the same direction. At one end, impurities get concentrated. This end is cut off. This method is very useful for producing semiconductor and other metals of very high purity. e.g., germanium. silicon. boron. gallium and indium.
* _Vapour phase refining_ In this method, the metal is converted into its volatile compound and collected elsewhere. It is then decomposed to give pure metal. So, the two requirements are:
* the metal should form a volatile compound with an available reagent.
* the volatile compound should be easily decomposable. so that the recovery is easy. Following examples will illustrate this technique. _Mond Process for Refining Nickel:_ In this process. nickel is heated in a stream of carbon monoxide forming a volatile complex. nickel tetracarbonyl: \[\text{Ni}+4\text{CO}\xrightarrow{330-350\text{K}}\text{Ni}(\text{CO})_{4}\] (6.54) The carbonyl is subjected to higher temperature so that it is decomposed giving the pure metal: \[\text{Ni}(\text{CO})_{4}\xrightarrow{490-470\text{K}}\text{Ni}+4\text{CO}\] (6.55) _van Arkel Method for Refining Zirconium or Titanium_ This method is very useful for removing all the oxygen and nitrogen present in the form of impurity in certain metals like Zr and Ti. The crude metal is heated in an evacuated vessel with iodine. The metal iodide being more covalent, volatilises: \[\text{Zr}+2\text{I}_{2}\rightarrow\text{ZrI}_{4}\] (6.56) The metal iodide is decomposed on a tungsten filament, electrically heated to about 1800K. The pure metal is thus deposited on the filament. \[\text{ZrI}_{4}\rightarrow\text{Zr}+2\text{I}_{2}\] (6.57) _(H) Chromatographic methods_ This method is based on the principle that different components of a mixture are differently adsorbed on an adsorbent. The mixture is put in a liquid or gaseous medium which is moved through the adsorbent.

Figure 6.7: Zone refining process

Different components are adsorbed at different levels on the column. Later the adsorbed components are removed (eluted) by using suitable solvents (eluant). Depending upon the physical state of the moving medium and the adsorbent material and also on the process of passage of the moving medium, the chromatographic method+ is given the name. In one such method the column of Al2O3 is prepared in a glass tube and the moving medium containing a solution of the components is in liquid form. This is an example of _column chromatography_. This is very useful for purification of the elements which are available in minute quantities and the impurities are not very different in chemical properties from the element to be purified. There are several chromatographic techniques such as paper chromatography, column chromatography, gas chromatography, etc. Procedures followed in column chromatography have been depicted in Fig. 8.

Figure 8: Schematic diagrams showing column chromatography

Ahuminium fols are used as wrappers for chocolates. The fine dust of the metal is used in paints and lacquers. Ahuminium, being highly reactive, is also used in the extraction of chromium and manganese from their oxides. Wires of aluminium are used as electricity conductors. Alloys containing aluminum, being light, are very useful

Copper is used for making wires used in electrical industry and for water and steam pipes. It is also used in several alloys that are rather tougher than the metal itself, e.g., brass (with zinc), bronze (with tin) and coinage alloy (with nickel).

Zinc is used for galvanising iron. It is also used in large quantities in batteries, as a constituent of many alloys, e.g., brass. (Cu 60%, Zn 40%) and german silver (Cu 25-30%, Zn 25-30%, Ni 40-50%). Zinc dust is used as a reducing agent in the manufacture of dye-stuffs, paints. etc.

Cast iron, which is the most important form of iron. is used for casting stoves. railway sleepers. gutter pipes. toys. etc. It is used in the manufacture of wrought iron and steel. Wrought iron is used in making anchors, wires, bolts, chains and agricultural implements. Steel finds a number of uses. Alloy steel is obtained when other metals are added to it. Nickel steel is used for making cables, automobiles and aeroplane parts, pendulum, measuring tapes, chrome steel for cutting tools and crushing machines, and stainless steel for cycles. automobiles. utensils, pens, etc.

### Summary

Metals are required for a variety of purposes. For this, we need their extraction from the minerals in which they are present and from which their extraction is commercially feasible.These minerals are known as ores. Ores of the metal are associated with many impurities. Removal of these impurities to certain extent is achieved in concentration steps. The concentrated or is then treated chemically for obtaining the metal. Usually the metal compounds (e.g., oxides, sulphides) are reduced to the metal. The reducing agents used are carbon. CO or even some metals. In these reduction processes, the thermodynamic and electrochemical concepts are given due consideration. The metal oxide reacts with a reducing agent: the oxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions, the net Gibbs energy change is negative, which becomes more negative on raising the temperature. Conversion of the physical states from solid to liquid or to gas, and formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire system. This concept is graphically displayed in plots of \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) vs T (Ellin diagram) for such oxidation/reduction reactions at different temperatures. The concept of electrode potential is useful in the isolation of metals (e.g., Al. Ag. Au) where the sum of the two redox couples is \(\times\)e so that the Gibbs energy change is negative. The metals obtained by usual methods still contain minor impurities. Getting pure metals require refining. Refining process depends upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried out from its bauxtic ore by leaching it with NaOH. Sodium aluminate, thus formed, is separated and then neutralised to give back the hydrated oxide, which is then electrolysed using cryolite as a flux. Extraction of iron is done by reduction of its oxide ore in blast furnace. Copper is extracted by smelting and heating in a reverberatory furn ace. Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several methods are employed in refining the metal. Metals, in general, are very widely used and have contributed significantly in the development of a variety of industries.

### Answers to Some Intext Questions

* Ores in which one of the components (either the impurity or the actual ore) is magnetic can be concentrated, e.g., ores containing iron (haematite, magnetite, siderite and iron pyttes).
* Leaching is significant as it helps in removing the impurities like SiO\({}_{2}\), Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), etc. from the bauxite ore.

### Group 15

Group 15 includes nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth. As we go down the group, there is a shift from non-metallic to metallic through metallodic character. Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids and bismuth is a typical metal.

Molecular nitrogen comprises 78% by volume of the atmosphere. In the earth's crust, it occurs as sodium nitrate, NaNO\({}_{\text{a}}\) (called Chile saltpte) and potassium nitrate (Indian saltpte). It is found in the form of proteins in plants and animals. Phosphorus occurs in mineralsof the apatite family, Ca\({}_{9}\)(PO\({}_{4}\))\({}_{6}\). CaX\({}_{2}\) (X = F, Cl or OH) [e.g., fluorapatite Ca\({}_{9}\)(PO\({}_{4}\))\({}_{6}\). CaF\({}_{2}\)] which are the main components of phosphate rocks. Phosphorus is an essential constituent of animal and plant matter. It is present in bones as well as in living cells. Phosphoproteins are present in milk and eggs. Arsenic, antimony and bismuth are found mainly as sulphide minerals.

The important atomic and physical properties of this group elements along with their electronic configurations are given in Table 7.1.

Trends of some of the atomic, physical and chemical properties of the group are discussed below.

#### 7.1.2 Electronic

The valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is \(ns^{2}np^{3}\). Configuration

The s orbital in these elements is completely filled and \(p\) orbitals are half-filled, making ther electronic configuration extra stable.

#### 7.1.3 Atomic and

Covalent and ionic (in a particular state) radii increase in size Ionic Radii

down the group. There is a considerable increase in covalent radius from N to P. However, from As to BI only a small increase in covalent radius is observed. This is due to the presence of completely filled \(d\) and/or \(f\) orbitals in heavier members.

#### 7.1.4 Ionisation

Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group due to gradual increase in atomic size. Because of the extra stable half-filled \(p\) orbitals electronic configuration and smaller size, the ionisation enthalpy of the group 15 elements is much greater than that of group 14 elements in the corresponding periods. The order of successive ionisation enthalpies, as expected is \(\Delta\)H\({}_{1}\) < \(\Delta\)H\({}_{2}\) < \(\Delta\)H\({}_{3}\) (Table 7.1).

7.1.5

The electronegativity value, in general, decreases down the group with increasing atomic size. However, amongst the heavier elements, the difference is not that much pronounced.

7.1.6 Physical

All the elements of this group are polyatomic. Dmitrogen is a diatomic gas while all others are solids. Metallic character increases down the group. Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids and bismuth is a metal. This is due to decrease in ionisation enthalpy and increase in atomic size. The boiling points, in general, increase from top to bottom in the group but the melting point increases upto arsenic and then decreases upto bismuth. Except nitrogen, all the elements show allotropy.

7.1.7 Chemical

Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity

The common oxidation states of these elements are -3, +3 and +5. The tendency to exhibit -3 oxidation state decreases down the group due to increase in size and metallic character. In fact last member of the group, bismuth hardly forms any compound in -3 oxdstation state. The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group. The only well characterised Bi (V) compound is BiF\({}_{5}\). The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases and that of +3 state increases (due to inert pair effect) down the group. Nitrogen exhibits + 1, + 2, + 4 oxidation states also when it reacts with oxygen. Phosphorus also shows +1 and +4 oxidation states in some oxoacids.

In the case of nitrogen, all oxidation states from +1 to +4 tend to disproportionate in acid solution. For example,

3HNO\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) HNO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + 2NO

Similarly, in case of phosphorus nearly all intermediate oxidation states disproportionate into +5 and -3 both in alkali and acid. However +3 oxidation state in case of arsenic, antimony and bismuth become increasingly stable with respect to disproportionation.

Nitrogen is restricted to a maximum covalency of 4 since only four (one s and three \(p\)) orbitals are available for bonding. The heavier elements have vacant d orbitals in the outermost shell which can be used for bonding (coavancy) and hence, expand their covalence as in PF\({}_{6}^{*}\).

Anomalous properties of nitrogen

Nitrogen differs from the rest of the members of this group due to its smaller size, high electronegativity, high ionisation enthalpy and non-availability of \(d\) orbitals. Nitrogen has unique ability to form \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) multiple bonds with itself and with other elements having small size and high electronegativity (e.g., C, O). Heavier elements of this group do not form \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) bonds as their atomic orbitals are so large and diffuse that they cannot have effective overlapping. Thus, nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule with a triple bond (one s and two \(p\)) between the two atoms. Consequently, its bond enthalpy (941.4 kJ mol\({}^{+}\)) is very high. On the contrary, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony form single bonds as P-P, As-As and Sb-Sb while bismuth forms metallic bonds in elemental state. However, the single N-N bond is weaker than the single P-P bond because of high interelectronic repulsion of the non-bonding electrons, owing to the small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency is weaker in nitrogen. Another factor which affects the chemistry of nitrogen is the absence of \(d\) orbitals in its valence shell. Besides restricting its covalency to four, nitrogen cannot form \(d\pi-p\pi\) bond as the heavier elements can e.g., R\({}_{3}\)P = 0 or R\({}_{3}\)P = CH\({}_{2}\) (R = alkyl group). Phosphorus and arsenic can form \(d\pi-d\pi\) bond also with transition metals when their compounds like P(C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\) and As(C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\) act as ligands.

(i) _Reactivity towards hydrogen_: All the elements of Group 15 form hydrides of the type EH\({}_{3}\) where E = N, P, As, Sb or Bi. Some of the properties of these hydrides are shown in Table 7.2. The hydrides show regular gradation in their properties. The stability of hydrides decreases from NH\({}_{3}\) to BiH\({}_{3}\) which can be observed from their bond dissociation enthalpy. Consequently, the reducing character of the hydrides increases. Ammonia is only a mild reducing agent while BH\({}_{3}\) is the strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides. Basicity also decreases in the order NH\({}_{3}\) > PH\({}_{3}\) > AsH\({}_{3}\) > SbH\({}_{3}\) > SbH\({}_{3}\).

(ii) _Reactivity towards oxygen_: All these elements form two types of oxides: E\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and E\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). The oxide in the higher oxidation state of the element is more acidic than that of lower oxidation state. Their acidic character decreases down the group. The oxides of the type E\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) of nitrogen and phosphorus are purely acidic, that of arsenic and antimony amphoteric and those of bismuth is predominantly basic. (iii) _Reactivity towards halogens_: These elements react to form two series of halides: EX\({}_{3}\) and EX\({}_{6}\). Nitrogen does not form pentahalide due to non-availability of the \(d\) orbitals in its valence shell. Pentahalides are more covalent than trihalides. All the trihalides of these elements except those of nitrogen are stable. In case of nitrogen, only NF\({}_{3}\) is known to be stable. Trihalides except BiF\({}_{3}\) are predominantly covalent in nature. (iv) _Reactivity towards metals_: All these elements react with metals to form their binary compounds exhibiting -3 oxidation state, such as, Ca\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{2}\) (calcium nitride) Ca\({}_{3}\)P\({}_{2}\) (calcium phosphide), Na\({}_{3}\)As\({}_{2}\) (sodium arsenide), Zn\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{2}\) (zinc antimonide) and Mg\({}_{6}\)Sb\({}_{2}\) (magnesium bismuthide).

It combines with hydrogen at about 773 K in the presence of a catalyst (Haber's Process) to form ammonia:

Dmitrogen combines with dioxygen only at very high temperature (at about 2000 K) to form nitric oxide, NO.

Lose: The main use of dinitrogen is in the manufacture of ammonia and other industrial chemicals containing nitrogen, (e.g., calcium cyanamide). It also finds use where an inert atmosphere is required (e.g., in Iron and steel industry, inert diluent for reactive chemicals). Liquid dinitrogen is used as a refrigerant to preserve biological materials, food items and in cryosurgery.

Preparation

In the laboratory, nitric acid is prepared by heating \(\mathrm{KNO_{3}}\) or \(\mathrm{NaNO_{z}}\) and concentrated \(\mathrm{H_{2}SO_{4}}\) in a glass retort.

\(\mathrm{NaNO_{3}+H_{2}SO_{4}\to NaHSO_{4}+HNO_{3}}\)

On a large scale it is prepared mainly by Ostwald's process. This method is based upon catalytic oxidation of \(\mathrm{NH_{3}}\) by atmospheric oxygen.

\(\mathrm{NH_{3}}\left(g\right)+50\mathrm{O_{2}}\left(g\right)\)\(\mathrm{Pr\left(g\right)\mathrm{Baug\,catalyst}}\)\(\mathrm{500K,\,9bar}\)\(\mathrm{4NO\left(g\right)+6H_{2}O(g)}\)

N nitric oxide thus formed combines with oxygen giving \(\mathrm{NO_{2}}\).

\(\mathrm{2NO\left(g\right)+O_{2}\left(g\right)\rightleftharpoons\mathrm{2NO_{2} \left(g\right)}}\)

Nitrogen dioxide so formed, dissolves in water to give \(\mathrm{HNO_{3}}\).

\(\mathrm{3NO_{2}\left(g\right)+H_{2}O(1)\to 2HNO_{3}\left(aq\right)+NO(g)}\)

NO thus formed is recycled and the aqueous \(\mathrm{HNO_{3}}\) can be concentrated by distillation upto - 68% by mass. Further concentration to 98% can be achieved by dehydration with concentrated \(\mathrm{H_{2}SO_{4}}\).

Properties

It is a colourless liquid (f.p. 231.4 K and b.p. 355.6 K). Laboratory grade nitric acid contains - 68% of the \(\mathrm{HNO_{3}}\) by mass and has a specific gravity of 1.504.

In the gaseous state, \(\mathrm{HNO_{3}}\) exists as a planar molecule with the structure as shown.

In aqueous solution, nitric acid behaves as a strong acid giving hydronium and nitrate ions.

\(\mathrm{HNO_{3}(aq)+H_{2}O(1)\to H_{3}O^{\prime}(aq)+NO_{3}(aq)}\)

Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidising agent and attacks most metals except noble metals such as gold and platinum. The products of oxidation depend upon the concentration of the acid, temperature and the nature of the material undergoing oxidation.

\(\mathrm{3Cu+8\,HNO_{3}(dilute)\to 3Cu(NO_{3})_{2}+2NO+4H_{2}O}\)

\(\mathrm{Cu+4HNO_{3}(conc.)\to Cu(NO_{3})_{2}+2NO_{2}+2H_{2}O}\)

Zinc reacts with dilute nitric acid to give \(\mathrm{N_{2}O}\) and with concentrated acid to give \(\mathrm{NO_{2}}\).

\(\mathrm{4Zn+10HNO_{3}(dilute)\to 4\ Zn\ (\mathrm{NO_{3}})_{2}+5H_{2}O+N_{2}O}\)

\(\mathrm{Zn+4HNO_{3}(conc.)\to Zn\ (\mathrm{NO_{3}})_{2}+2H_{2}O+2NO_{2}}\)

Some metals (e.g., Cr, Al) do not dissolve in concentrated nitric acid because of the formation of a passive film of oxide on the surface.

Concentrated nitric acid also oxidises non-metals and their compounds. Iodine is oxidised to iodide acid, carbon to carbon dioxide, sulphur to \(\mathrm{H_{2}SO_{4}}\), and phosphorus to phosphoric acid.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:571]

It is polymeric, consisting of chains of P\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra linked together in the manner as shown in Fig. 7.3.

**Black phosphorus** has two forms \(\alpha\)-black phosphorus and \(\beta\)-black phosphorus. \(\alpha\)-Black phosphorus is formed when red phosphorus is heated in a sealed tube at 803K. It can be sublimed in air and has opaque monoclinic or rhombohedral crystals. It does not oxidles in air. \(\beta\)-Black phosphorus is prepared by heating white phosphorus at 473 K under high pressure. It does not burn in air upto 673 K.

_Preparation_

Phosphine is prepared by the reaction of calcium phosphide with water or dilute HCl.

Ca\({}_{3}\)P\({}_{2}\) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\) 3Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) + 2PH\({}_{3}\)

Ca\({}_{3}\)P\({}_{2}\) + 6HC1 \(\rightarrow\) 3CaCl\({}_{2}\) + 2PH\({}_{3}\)

In the laboratory, it is prepared by heating white phosphorus with concentrated NaOH solution in an inert atmosphere of CO\({}_{2}\).

\[\begin{split}\text{P}_{4}+3\text{NaOH}+3\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \rightarrow\text{PH}_{3}&+3\text{NaH}_{2}\text{PO}_{2}\\ &\text{(sodium hypophosphite)}\end{split}\]

When pure, it is non inflammable but becomes inflammable owing to the presence of P\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) or P\({}_{4}\) vapours. To purify it from the impurities, it is absorbed in HI to form phosphonium iodide (PH\({}_{4}\)) which on treating with KOH gives off phosphine.

\[\text{PH}_{4}\text{I}+\text{KOH}\rightarrow\text{KI}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}+ \text{PH}_{3}\]

_Properties_

It is a colourless gas with rotten fish smell and is highly poisonous. It explodes in contact with traces of oxidising agents like HNO\({}_{3}\), Cl\({}_{2}\) and Br\({}_{2}\) vapours.

It is slightly soluble in water. The solution of PH\({}_{3}\) in water decomposes in presence of light giving red phosphorus and H\({}_{2}\). When absorbed in copper sulphate or mercuric chloride solution, the corresponding phosphides are obtained.

\[\begin{split} 3\text{CuSO}_{4}+2\text{PH}_{3}\rightarrow\text{ Cu}_{3}\text{P}_{2}+3\text{H}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\\ 3\text{HgCl}_{2}+2\text{PH}_{3}\rightarrow\text{Hg}_{3}\text{P}_{2}+6 \text{HCl}\end{split}\]

Phosphine is weakly basic and like ammonia, gives phosphonium compounds with acids e.g.,

PH\({}_{3}+\text{HBr}\rightarrow\text{PH}_{4}\text{Br}\)

[_l_ loss: The spontaneous combustion of phosphine is technically used in _Holme's signals_. Containers containing calcium carbide and calcium phosphide are pierced and thrown in the sea when the gases evolved burn and serve as a signal. It is also used in _smoke screens_.

Chemistry \(\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{\phantom{\underline{\phantom{ \underline{\phantom{\underline{\phantom{\underline{\

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:573]

When heated, it sublimes but decomposes on stronger heating.

It reacts with organic compounds containing -OH group converting them to chloro derivatives.

\(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}OH+PCl_{5}\to C_{2}H_{5}Cl+POCl_{3}+HCl}\)

\(\mathrm{CH_{5}COOH+PCl_{5}\to CH_{3}COCl+POCl_{3}+HCl}\)

Finely divided metals on heating with \(\mathrm{PCL_{5}}\) give corresponding chlorodes.

\(\mathrm{2Ag+PCl_{5}\to 2AgCl+PCl_{3}}\)

\(\mathrm{Sn+2PCl_{3}\to SnCl_{4}+2PCl_{3}}\)

It is used in the synthesis of some organic compounds, e.g., \(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}Cl}\), \(\mathrm{CH_{3}COCl}\).

In gaseous and liquid phases, it has a trigonal bipyramidal structure as shown below. The three equatorial P-Cl bonds are equivalent, while the two axial bonds are longer than equatorial bonds. This is due to the fact that the axial bond pairs suffer more repulsion as compared to equatorial bond pairs.

In the solid state it exists as an ionic solid, \([\mathrm{PCL_{4}}]^{\prime}[\mathrm{PCl_{6}}]\) in which the cation, \([\mathrm{PCL_{4}}]^{\prime}\) is tetrahedral and the anion, \([\mathrm{PCL_{6}}]\) octahedral.

### 7.9 Oxacids of \(\mathcal{D}_{losphorus}\)

Phosphorus forms a number of oxacids. The important oxacids of phosphorus with their formulas, methods of preparation and the presence of some characteristic bonds in their structures are given in Table 7.5.

The compositions of the oxoacids are interrelated in terms of loss or gain of H\({}_{2}\)O molecule or O-atom.

The structures of some important oxoacids are given below:

Figure 7.4: Structures of some important oxoacids of phosphorus

In oxoacids phosphorus is tetrahedrally surrounded by other atoms. All these acids contain one P=O and at least one P-OH bond. The oxoacids in which phosphorus has lower oxidation state (less than +5) contain, in addition to P=O and P-OH bonds, either P-P (e.g., in H\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\)) or P-H (e.g., in H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{2}\)) bonds but not both. These acids in +3 oxidation state of phosphorus tend to disproportionate to higher and lower oxidation states. For example, orthophosphorous acid (or phosphorous acid) on heating disproportionates to give orthophosphoric acid (or phosphoric acid) and phosphine.

\(4\)H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(3\)H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)\(+\)PH\({}_{3}\)

The acids which contain P-H bond have strong reducing properties. Thus, hypophosphorous acid is a good reducing agent as it contains two P-H bonds and reduces, for example, AgNO\({}_{3}\) to metallic silver.

\(4\) AgNO\({}_{3}\) + \(2\)H\({}_{2}\)O + H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(4\)Ag + \(4\)HNO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)

These P-H bonds are not ionisable to give H\({}^{+}\) and do not play any role in baselity. Only those H atoms which are attached with oxygen in P-OH form are ionisable and cause the baselity. Thus, H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) are dibasel and tribasic, respectively as the structure of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\) has two P-OH bonds and H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) three.

Oxygen, sulphur, selenium, tellurium and polonium constitute Group 16 of the periodic table. This is sometimes known as group of _chalcogens_. The name is derived from the Greek word for brass and points to the association of sulphur and its congeners with copper. Most copper minerals contain either oxygen or sulphur and frequently the other members of the group.

Oxygen is the most abundant of all the elements on earth. Oxygen forms about 46.6% by mass of earth's crust. Dry air contains 20.946% oxygen by volume.

However, the abundance of sulphur in the earth's crust is only 0.03-0.1%. Combined sulphur exists primarily as sulphates such as gypsum CaSO\({}_{4}\),2H\({}_{3}\)O, _eppsom salt_ MgSO\({}_{4}\),7H\({}_{2}\)O, _bartye_ BaSO\({}_{4}\) and sulphides such as _galena_ PbS. _zinc blende_ ZnS, _copper purites_ CuFeS\({}_{2}\). Traces of sulphur occur as hydrogen sulphide in volcanoes. Organic materials such as eggs, proteins, garlic, onion, mustard, hair and wool contain sulphur.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:577]

in the case of OF\({}_{2}\) where its oxidation state is + 2. Other elements of the group exhibit + 2, + 4, + 6 oxidation states but + 4 and + 6 are more common. Suplhur, selenium and tellurium usually show + 4 oxidation state in their compounds with oxygen and + 6 with fluorine. The stability of + 6 oxidation state decreases down the group and stability of + 4 oxidation state increase (inert pair effect). Bonding in +4 and +6 oxidation states are primarily covalent.

_Anomalous behaviour of oxygen_

The anomalous behaviour of oxygen, like other members of _p_-block present in second period is due to its small size and high electronegativity. One typical example of effects of small size and high electronegativity is the presence of strong hydrogen bonding in H\({}_{2}\)O which is not found in H\({}_{2}\)S.

The absence of \(d\) orbitals in oxygen limits its covalency to four and in practice, rarely exceeds two. On the other hand, in case of other elements of the group, the valence shells can be expanded and covalence exceeds four.

_Reactivity with hydrogen_: All the elements of Group 16 form hydrides of the type H\({}_{2}\)E (E = S, Se, Te, Po). Some properties of hydrides are given in Table 7.7. Their acklic character increases from H\({}_{2}\)O to H\({}_{2}\)Te. The increase in acidic character can be explained in terms of decrease in bond (H-E) dissociation enthalpy down the group. Owing to the decrease in bond (H-E) dissociation enthalpy down the group, the thermal stability of hydrides also decreases from H\({}_{2}\)O to H\({}_{2}\)Po. All the hydrides except water possess reducing property and this character increases from H\({}_{2}\)S to H\({}_{2}\)Te.

_Use_. In addition to its importance in normal respiration and combustion processes, oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding, in the manufacture of many metals, particularly steel. Oxygen cylinders are widely used in hospitals, high altitude flying and in mountaineering. The combustion of fuels, e.g., hydrazines in liquid oxygen, provides tremendous thrust in rockets.

_Interval Questions_

**7.16**: Which of the following does not react with oxygen directly?

**7.17**: Complete the following reactions:

(I) C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)

**7.12**: _Simple Oxides_

A binary compound of oxygen with another element is called oxide. As already stated, oxygen reacts with most of the elements of the periodic table to form oxides. In many cases one element forms two or more oxides. The oxides vary widely in their nature and properties.

Oxides can be simple (e.g., MgO, Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) ) or mixed (Pb\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\), Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\)). Simple oxides can be classified on the basis of their acidic, basic or amphoteric character. An oxide that combines with water to give an acid is termed acidic oxide (e.g., SO\({}_{2}\), Cl\({}_{5}\)O\({}_{7}\), CO\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\)). For example, SO\({}_{2}\) combines with water to give H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\), an acid.

SO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\)

As a general rule, only non-metal oxides are acidic but oxides of some metals in high oxidation state also have acidic character (e.g., Mn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), CrO\({}_{8}\), V\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\)). The oxides which give a base with water are known as basic oxides (e.g., Na\({}_{2}\)O, CaO, BaO). For example, CaO combines with water to give Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\), a base.

CaO + H\({}_{2}\)O + Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\)

In general, metallic oxides are basic.

Some metallic oxides exhibit a dual behaviour. They show characteristics of both acidic as well as basic oxides. Such oxides are known as amphoteric oxides. They react with acids as well as alkalies. There are some oxides which are neither acidic nor basic. Such oxides are known as neutral oxides. Examples of neutral oxides are CO, NO and N\({}_{2}\)O. For example, Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) reacts with acids as well as alkalies.

Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (s) + 6HC1(aq) + 9H\({}_{2}\)O(1) \(\rightarrow\) 2[A[H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3}\) (aq) + 6C1(aq)] Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (s) + 6NaOH(aq) + 3H\({}_{2}\)O(1) \(\rightarrow\) 2Na\({}_{3}\)[Al(OH)\({}_{6}\)](aq)

### Ozone

Ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen. It is too reactive to remain for long in the atmosphere at sea level. At a height of about 20 kilometres, it is formed from atmospheric oxygen in the presence of sunlight. This ozone layer protects the earth's surface from an excesshev concentration of ultraviolet (UV) radiations.
Preparation

When a slow dry stream of oxygen is passed through a silent electrical discharge, conversion of oxygen to ozone (10%) occurs. The product is known as ozonised oxygen.

3O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2O\({}_{3}\) AH\({}^{\circ}\) (298 K) = +142 kJ mol\({}^{\uptau}\)

Since the formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic process, it is necessary to use a silent electrical discharge in its preparation to prevent its decomposition.

If concentrations of ozone greater than 10 per cent are required, a battery of ozonisers can be used, and pure ozone (b.p. 385 K) can be condensed in a vessel surrounded by liquid oxygen.

Properties

Pure ozone is a pale blue gas, dark blue liquid and violet-black solid. Ozone has a characteristic smell and in small concentrations it is harmless. However, if the concentration rises above about 100 parts per million, breathing becomes uncomfortable resulting in headache and nausea.

Ozone is thermodynamically unstable with respect to oxygen since its decomposition into oxygen results in the liberation of heat (\(\Delta\)H is negative) and an increase in entropy (aS is positive). These two effects reinforce each other, resulting in large negative Gibbs energy change (\(\Delta\)G) for its conversion into oxygen. It is not really surprising, therefore, high concentrations of ozone can be dangerously explosive.

Due to the ease with which it liberates atoms of nascent oxygen (O\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) O\({}_{2}\) + O), it acts as a powerful oxidizing agent. For e.g., it oxidises lead sulphide to lead sulphate and iodide ions to iodine.

PbS(s) + 4O\({}_{3}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) PbSO\({}_{4}\)(s) + 4O\({}_{2}\)(g)

2T(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + O\({}_{3}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2OH(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(s) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

When ozone reacts with an excess of potassium iodide solution buffered with a borate buffer (pH 9.2), iodine is liberated which can be titrated against a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate. This is a quantitative method for estimating O\({}_{3}\) gas.

Experiments have shown that nitrogen oxides (particularly nitric oxide) combine very rapidly with ozone and there is, thus, the possibility that nitrogen oxides emitted from the exhaust systems of supersonic jet aeroplanes might be slowly depleting the concentration of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.

\({}^{\circ}\)NO(g) + O\({}_{3}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) NO\({}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

Another threat to this ozone layer is probably posed by the use of frenons which are used in aerosol sprays and as refrigerants.

The two oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in the ozone molecule are identical (128 pm) and the molecule is angular as expected with a bond angle of about 117\({}^{\circ}\). It is a resonance hybrid of two main forms:

_(lse_ it is used as a germicide, disinfectant and for sterlisting water. It is also used for bleaching oils, ivory, flour, starch, etc. It acts as an oxidising agent in the manufacture of potassium permanganate.

#### 7.1.3 Coaxoids of \(\mathrm{Sulphhur}\)

Sulphuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals worldwide.

Sulphuric acid is manufactured by the Contact Process which involves three steps:

 burning of sulphur or sulphide ores in air to generate SO\({}_{2}\).

 conversion of SO\({}_{2}\) to SO\({}_{3}\) by the reaction with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst (V\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)), and

 absorption of SO\({}_{3}\) in H\({}_{3}\)SO\({}_{4}\) to give _Oleum_ (H\({}_{3}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)).

A flow diagram for the manufacture of sulphur acid is shown in (Fig. 7.7). The SO\({}_{2}\) produced is purified by removing dust and other impurities such as arsenic compounds.

The key step in the manufacture of H\({}_{3}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is the catalytic oxidation of SO\({}_{2}\) with O\({}_{2}\) to give SO\({}_{3}\) in the presence of V\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (catalyst).

\(2\mathrm{SO_{2}}\left(g\right)+\mathrm{O_{2}}\left(g\right)\)\(\xrightarrow{\mathrm{v,o}}\)\(\xrightarrow{\mathrm{2SO_{3}}\left(g\right)}\)\(\xrightarrow{\mathrm{A}}\)\(H^{\mathrm{o}}=-196.6\mathrm{k}\mathrm{Jmol^{-1}}\)

The reaction is exothermic, reversible and the forward reaction leads to a decrease in volume. Therefore, low temperature and high pressure are the favourable conditions for maximum yield. But the temperature should not be very low otherwise rate of reaction will become slow.

In practice, the plant is operated at a pressure of 2 bar and a temperature of 720 K. The SO\({}_{3}\) gas from the catalytic converter is

Figure 7.6: Structures of some important oxoadds of sulphur

absorbed in concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) to produce _oleum_. Dilution of oleum with water gives H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) of the desired concentration. In the industry two steps are carried out simultaneously to make the process a continuous one and also to reduce the cost.

SO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)

(Oleum)

The sulphuric acid obtained by Contact process is 96-98% pure.

#### Properties

Sulphuric acid is a colourless, dense, oily liquid with a specific gravity of 1.84 at 298 K. The acid freezes at 283 K and bolts at 611 K. It dissolves in water with the evolution of a large quantity of heat. Hence, care must be taken while preparing sulphuric acid solution from concentrated sulphuric acid. The concentrated acid must be added slowly into water with constant stirring.

The chemical reactions of sulphuric acid are as a result of the following characteristics: (a) low volatility (b) strong acidic character (c) strong affinity for water and d (d) ability to act as an oxidising agent. In aqueous solution, sulphuric acid ionises in two steps.

H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) + HSO\({}_{4}\)(aq):K\({}_{a}\) = very large (K\({}_{a_{i}}\) >10)

HSO\({}_{7}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) + SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)(aq) :K\({}_{a_{i}}\) = 1.2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{\prime 2}\)

The larger value of 'K\({}_{a_{i}}\) (K\({}_{a_{i}}\) >10) means that H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is largely dissociated into H\({}^{\prime}\) and HSO\({}_{4}\). Greater the value of dissociation constant (K\({}_{a}\)), the stronger is the acid.

The acid forms two series of salts: normal sulphates (such as sodium sulphate and copper sulphate) and acid sulphates (e.g., sodium hydrogen sulphate).

Sulphuric acid, because of its low volatility can be used to manufacture more volatile acids from their corresponding salts.

The trends of some of the atomic, physical and chemical properties are discussed below.

* All these elements have seven electrons in their outermost shell Configuration (\(ns^{2}n\bar{p}\)) which is one electron short of the next noble gas.
* The halogens have the smallest atomic radii in their respective periods and Ionic Radii like the other elements of second period is extremely small. Atomic and ionic radii increase from fluorine to iodine due to increasing number of quantum shells.
* They have little tendency to lose electron. Thus they have very high Enthalpy ionisation enthalpy. Due to increase in atomic size, ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group.
* Halogens have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy in the Gain corresponding periods. This is due to the fact that the atoms of these Enthalpy elements have only one electron less than stable noble gas configurations. Electron gain enthalpy of the elements of the group becomes less negative down the group. However, the negative electron gain enthalpy of fluorine is less than that of chlorine. It is due to small sze of fluorine atom. As a result, there are strong interelectronic repulsions in the relatively small \(2p\) orbitals of fluorine and thus, the incoming electron does not experience much attraction.
* They have very high electronegativity. The electronegativity decreases down the group. Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table.
* Halogens have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy in the _Example 7.14_ respective periods of the periodic table. Why? Halogens have the smallest sze in their respective periods and therefore _Solution_ high effective nuclear charge. As a consequence, they readily accept one electron to acquire noble gas electronic configuration.
* Halogens display smooth variations in their physical properties. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid. Their melting and boiling points steadily increase with atomic number. All halogens are coloured. This is due to absorption of radiations in visible region which results in the excitation of outer electrons to higher energy level. By absorbing different quanta of radiation, they display different colours. For example, F\({}_{2}\), has yellow, Cl\({}_{2}\), greenish yellow, Br\({}_{2}\), red and l\({}_{2}\), violet colour. Fluorine and chlorine react with water. Bromine and iodine are only sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in various organic solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulphide and hydrocarbons to give coloured solutions.

One curious anomaly we notice from Table 7.8 is the smaller enthalpy of dissociation of F\({}_{2}\) compared to that of Cl\({}_{2}\) whereas X-X bond dissociation enthalpies from chlorine onwards show the expectedtrend: Cl - Cl > Br - Br > I - I. A reason for this anomaly is the relattevely large electron-electron repulsion among the lone pairs in F\({}_{2}\) molecule where they are much closer to each other than in case of Cl\({}_{2}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline _Example 7.15_ & Although electron gain enthalpy of fluorine is less negative as compared to chlorine, fluorine is a stronger oxidising agent than chlorine.

are essentially oxygen fluorides because of the higher electronegativity of fluorine than oxygen. Both are strong fluorating agents. O\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{2}\) oxidises plutonium to PuF\({}_{6}\) and the reaction is used in removing plutonium as PuF\({}_{6}\) from spent nuclear fuel.

Chlorine, bromine and iodine form oxides in which the oxidation states of these halogens range from +1 to +7. A combination of kinetic and thermodynamic factors lead to the generally decreasing order of stability of oxides formed by halogens, I \(>\) Cl \(>\) Br. The higher oxides of halogens tend to be more stable than the lower ones.

Chlorine oxides, Cl\({}_{2}\)O, Cl\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and Cl\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) are highly reactive oxidising agents and tend to explode. Cl\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) is used as a bleaching agent for paper pulp and textiles and in water treatment.

The bromine oxides, Br\({}_{2}\)O, BrO\({}_{2}\), BrO\({}_{3}\) are the least stable halogen oxides (middle row anomally) and exist only at low temperatures. They are very powerful oxidising agents.

The iodine oxides, I\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\), I\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\), I\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) are insoluble solids and decompose on heating. I\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is a very good oxidising agent and is used in the estimation of carbon monoxide.

_Reactivity towards metals_: Halogens react with metals to form metal halides. For e.g., bromine reacts with magnesium to give magnesium bromide.

Mg(s) + Br\({}_{2}\)(i) \(\rightarrow\) MgBr\({}_{2}\)(s) The ionic character of the halides decreases in the order MF \(>\) MC1 \(>\) MBr \(>\) MI where M is a monovalent metal. If a metal exhibits more than one oxidation state, the halides in higher oxidation state will be more covalent than the one in lower oxidation state. For e.g., SnCl\({}_{4}\), PbCl\({}_{4}\), SbCl\({}_{5}\) and UF\({}_{6}\) are more covalent than SnCl\({}_{2}\), PbCl\({}_{2}\), SbCl\({}_{5}\) and UF\({}_{4}\) respectively.

_Reactivity of halogens towards other halogens_: Halogens combine amongst themselves to form a number of compounds known as interhalogens of the types XX, XX\({}_{3}\), XX\({}_{6}\) and XX\({}_{7}\); where X is a larger size halogen and X is smaller size halogen.

Fluorine exhibits only \(-1\) oxidation state whereas other halogens exhibit + 1, + 3, + 5 and + 7 oxidation states also. Explain.

Solution Fluorine is the most electronegative element and cannot exhibit any positive oxidation state. Other halogens have \(d\) orbitals and therefore, can expand their octets and show + 1, + 3, + 5 and + 7 oxidation states also.

The composition of bleaching powder is Ca(OCl)\({}_{2}\).CaCl\({}_{2}\).Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\).2H\({}_{2}\)O. Chlorine reacts with hydrocarbons and gives substitution products with saturated hydrocarbons and addition products with unsaturated hydrocarbons. For example,

Its aqueous solution is called hydrochloric acid. High value of dissociation constant (K\({}_{a}\)) indicates that it is a strong acid in water. It reacts with NH\({}_{3}\) and gives white fumes of NH\({}_{4}\)Cl.

When three parts of concentrated HCl and one part of concentrated HNO\({}_{3}\) are mixed, aqua regla is formed which is used for dissolving noble metals, e.g., gold, platinum.

Its reaction with iron produces H\({}_{2}\). Solution

7.21 Oxacids of Halogens Due to high electronegativity and small size, fluorine forms only one oxoacid, HOF known as fluoric (I) acid or hypofluorous acid. The other halogens form several oxoacids. Most of them cannot be isolated in pure state. They are stable only in aqueous solutions or in the form of their salts. The oxoacids of halogens are given in Table 7.10 and their structures are given in Fig. 7.8.

_Example 7.10_: Deduce the molecular shape of BrF\({}_{3}\) on the basis of VSEPR theory.

_Solution_: The central atom Br has seven electrons in the valence shell. Three of these will form electron-pair bonds with three fluorine atoms leaving behind four electrons. Thus, there are three bond pairs and two lone pairs. According to VSEPR theory, these will occupy the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. The two lone pairs will occupy the equatorial positions to minimise lone pair-lone pair and the bond pair-lone pair repulsions which are greater than the bond pair-bond pair repulsions. In addition, the axial fluorine atoms will be bent towards the equatorial fluorine in order to minimise the lone-pair-lone pair repulsions. The shape would be that of a slightly bent 'T'.

_Use_: These compounds can be used as non aqueous solvents. Interhalogen compounds are very useful fluorinating agents. ClF\({}_{3}\) and BrF\({}_{3}\) are used for the production of UF\({}_{6}\) in the enrichment of \({}^{285}\)U.

_Context_:

**7.23.1**: _Overcurence_: All the noble gases except radon occur in the atmosphere. Their atmospheric abundance in dry air is - 1% by volume of which argon is the major constituent. Helium and sometimes neon are found in minerals of radioactive origin e.g., pitchblende. monazite. cleveite. The main commercial source of helium is natural gas. Xenon and radon are the rarest elements of the group. Radon is obtained as a decay product of \({}^{228}\)Ra.

\({}^{226}_{88}\)Ra \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{222}_{86}\)Rn \(+^{4}_{2}\)He

_Example 7.20_: Why are the elements of Group 18 known as noble gases?

_Solution_: The elements present in Group 18 have their valence shell orbitals completely filled and, therefore, react with a few elements only under certain conditions. Therefore, they are now known as noble gases.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

* describe the properties of the \(f\)-block elements and give a comparative account of the lanthanoids and actinoids with respect to their electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical behaviour,

_Inn, copper silver and gold are among the transition elements that have played important roles in the development of human utilisation, The inner transition elements such as Th, Pa and U are proving excellent sources of nuclearerenergy in modern times._

The \(d\)-block of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the \(d\) orbitals are progressively filled in each of the four long periods. The elements constituting the \(f\) -block are those in which the \(4\)\(f\) and \(5\)\(f\) orbitals are progressively filled in the latter two long periods; these elements are formal members of group 3 from which they have been taken out to form a separate \(f\)-block of the periodic table. The names _transition metals_ and _inner transition_ metals are often used to refer to the elements of \(d\)-and \(f\)-blocks respectively.

There are mainly three series of the transition metals, \(3d\) series (Sc to Zn), \(4d\) series (Y to Cd) and \(5d\) series (La to Hg, omitting Ce to Lu). The fourth \(6d\) series which begins with Ac is still incomplete. The two series of the inner transition metals, (\(4f\) and \(5f\)) are known as _ lanthanoids_ and _ actinoids_ respectively.

Strcly speaking, a transition element is defined as the one which has incompletely filled \(d\) orbitals in its ground state or in any one of its oxidation states, Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full \(d^{10}\) configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the three transition series, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals.

The presence of partly filled \(d\) or \(f\) orbitals in their atoms sets the study of the transition elements and their compounds apart from that of the main group elements. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the main group elements can also be applied successfully to the transition elements.

Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium form part of the transition metals.

In this Unit, besides introduction, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of the transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals and the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals.

## 8 The Transition Elements (\(d\)-Block)

### Position in the Periodic Table

The \(d\)-block occupies the large middle section flanked by s- and \(p\)- blocks in the periodic table. The very name 'transition' given to the elements of \(d\)-block is only because of their position between s- and \(p\)- block elements. The \(d\)-orbitals of the penultimate energy level in their atoms receive electrons giving rise to the three rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d and 5d. The fourth row of 6d is still incomplete. These series of the transition elements are shown in Table 8.1.

In general the electronic configuration of these elements is (n-1)\(d^{1-10}\)ns'=2. The (n-1) stands for the inner \(d\) orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)\(d\) and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. Consider the case of Cr, for example, which has 3\(d^{6}\) 4s' instead of 3\(d^{4}\) 4s\({}^{2}\): the energy gap between the two sets (3\(d\) and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3\(d\) orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is 3\(d^{0}\)4s' and not 3\(d^{7}\)4s\({}^{2}\). The outer electronic configurations of the transition elements are given in Table 8.1.

The electronic configurations of Zn, Cd and Hg are represented by the general formula (n-1)\(d^{10}\)ns\({}^{2}\). The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements.

The \(d\) orbitals of the transition elements project to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., \(s\) and \(p\)), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affecting the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given \(d^{5}\) configuration (n = 1 - 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled \(d\) orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.

The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit.

There are greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the transition elements in contrast to the main group elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particulary 3\(d\) row) and then consider some group similarities.

On what ground can you say that scandum (Z = 21) is a transition _Example 81_ element but zinc (Z = 30) is not?

On the basis of incompletely filled 3\(d\) orbitals in case of scandum atom _Solution_ in its ground state (3\(d^{10}\)), it is regarded as a transition element. On the other hand, zinc atom has completely filled \(d\) orbitals (3\(d^{10}\)) in its ground state as well as in its oxidised state, hence it is not regarded as a transition element.

The \(d\)- and \(f\)- Block ElementsThe transition metals (with the exception of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very much hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high. Fig. 8.1 depicts the melting points of the 3\(d\). 4\(d\) and 5\(d\) transition metals. The high melting points of these metals are attributed to the involvement of greater number of electrons from (n-1)\(d\) in addition to the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at \(d^{*}\) except for anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall regularly as the atomic number increases. They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 8.2. The maxima at about the middle of each series indicate that one unpaired electron per \(d\) orbital is particularly

Figure 8.1: Trends in melting points of transition elements

favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials).

Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 8.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series: this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal - metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.

In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a \(d\) orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by up tiny. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a \(d\) electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 8.3 show an increase from the first (\(3d\)) to the second (\(4d\)) series of the elements but the radii of the third (\(5d\)) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the \(4f\) orbitals which must be filled before the \(5d\) series of elements begin. The filling of \(4f\) before \(5d\) orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called **Lanthanoid contraction** which essentially compensates for the expected

Figure 8.3: The \(d\)- and \(f\)- Block Elements

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:610]

Why do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of _Example 8.2_

Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation.

_Interval Question_

**8.2**: In the series Sc (_Z_ = 21) to Zn (_Z_ = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). Why?

**8.3.3 Ionisation**: Due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner \(d\) orbitals, there is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right. However, many small variations occur. Table 8.2 gives the values for the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first row elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements. Although the first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, in general, is much higher.

The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the \(3d\) metals. though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of \(4s\) and \(3d\) orbitals. So the unipositive ions have \(d^{n}\) configurations with no \(4s\) electrons. There is thus, a reorganisation energy accompanying ionisation with some gains in exchange energy as the number of electrons increases and from the transference of \(s\) electrons into \(d\) orbitals. There is the generally expected increasing trend in the values as the effective nuclear charge increases. However, the value of Cr is lower because of the absence of any change in the \(d\) configuration and the value for Zn higher because it represents an ionisation from the \(4s\) level. The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To form the M\({}^{2*}\) ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation energies is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation for each element. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where the \(d^{5}\) and \(d^{10}\) configurations of the M\({}^{*}\) ions are disrupted, with considerable loss of exchange energy. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation consists of the removal of an electron which allows the production of the stable \(d^{10}\) configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the \(4s\) orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the \(d^{5}\) (Mn\({}^{2*}\)) and \(d^{10}\) (Zn\({}^{2*}\)) ions superimposed upon the general increasing trend. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high and there is a marked break between the values for Mn\({}^{2*}\) and Fe\({}^{2*}\). Also the high values for copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.

Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amendable to ready generalisation.

#### 8.3.4 Oxidation States

One of the notable features of a transition element is the great variety of oxidation states it may show in its compounds. Table 8.3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements.

The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series Scandium[II] is virtually unknown and titanium [V] is more stable than Ti[II] or Ti[II]. At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no \(d\) electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the \(s\) and \(d\) electrons upto manganese (Ti\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}}}\)O\({}_{2}\), V\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}}}\)O\({}_{2}\), Cr\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}}}\)O\({}_{2}\), Mn\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}}}\)O\({}_{4}\)) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{min}}}}\), Co\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}},\text{\text{\tiny{N}}}^{\text{\text{\tiny{I}}}}}\), Ni\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}},\text{\text{\tiny{N}}}^{\text{\text{\tiny{I}}}}}\), Cu\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{N}}}^{\text{\text{\tiny{I}}}}}\), Zn\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{N}}}}\).

The variablilty of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of \(d\) orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{I}}}}\), V\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{I}}}}\), V\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{N}}}}\), V\({}^{\text{\text{\tiny{V}}}}\). This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two.

An interesting feature in the variablilty of oxidation states of the \(d\)-block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the \(p\)-block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of \(d\)-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and WVI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO\({}_{3}\) and WO\({}_{3}\) are not.

Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of \(\pi\)-acceptor character in addition to the \(\sigma\)-bonding. For example, in Ni(CO)\({}_{3}\) and Fe(CO)\({}_{6}\), the oxidation state of nickel and Iron is zero.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:616]

attracted very strongly are said to be _ferromagnetic_. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the transition metal ions are paramagnetic.

Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the'spin-only' formula, i.e.,

\[\mu=\sqrt{n(n+2)}\]

where n is the number of unpaired electrons and \(\mu\) is the magnetic moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).

The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom. molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the'spin-only' formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 8.7. The experimental data are mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

3d\({}^{\text{\sc a}}\dealt with in detail in Unit 9). The transition metals form a large number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the availability of \(d\) orbitals for bond formation.

#### 8.3.12 Catalytic Properties

The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber's Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3\(d\) and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, Iron(III) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.

\(2\ \Gamma+\mathrm{S_{2}O_{3}}^{2-}\to 1_{2}+2\ \mathrm{SO_{4}}^{2-}\)

An explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:

\(2\ \mathrm{Fe^{3+}}+2\ \Gamma\to 2\ \mathrm{Fe^{2+}}+1_{2}\)

\(2\ \mathrm{Fe^{2+}}+\mathrm{S_{2}O_{3}}^{2-}\to 2\ \mathrm{Fe^{3+}}+2\mathrm{SO_{4}}^{2-}\)

#### 8.3.13 Formation

Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent, for example, TiC, Mn\({}_{4}\)N, Fe\({}_{3}\)H, VH\({}_{0\text{-}56}\) and TiH\({}_{1,\text{-}7}\), etc. The formulas quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, the see compounds are referred to as _interstitial_ compounds. The principal physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:

1. They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.
2. They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.
3. They retain metallic conductivity.
4. They are chemically inert.

#### 8.3.14 Alloy

An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.

Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of considerable industrial importance.

[FIGURE:S_Example 8.Q_: What is meant by 'disproportionation' of an oxidation state? Give an example.

_Solution_: When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation. For example, manganese (VI) becomes unstable relative to manganese(VII) and manganese (IV) in acidic solution.

_Context 8.4 Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements_: The case of Mn, Mn2O, is a covalent green oil. Even CrO3 and V2O5 have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic character is predominant.

Thus, Mn2O, gives HMnO4 and CrO3 gives H2CrO4 and H2CrO5, V2O5 is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO4- as well as VO2 salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic V2O3 to less basic V2O4 and to amphoteric V2O5. V2O4 dissolves in acids to give VO2 salts. Similarly, V2O5 reacts with alkalies as well as acids to give VO3- and VO4 respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic but Cr2O3 is amphoteric.

_Potassium dichromate_: RxCr2O, Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained by the fusion of chromtte ore (FeCr2O4) with sodium or potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium carbonate occurs as follows:

_4 FeCr2O4 + 8 Na2CO3 + 7 O2 \(\rightarrow\) 8 Na2CrO4 + 2 Fe2O3 + 8 CO2_: The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, Na2Cr2O, 2H2O can be crystallised._

_2Na2CrO4 + 2 H \(\rightarrow\) Na2Cr2O7 + 2 Na' + H2O_: The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, Na2Cr2O, 2H2O can be crystallised._

_2Na2CrO4 + 2 H \(\rightarrow\) Na2Cr2O7 + 2 Na' + H2O_: The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, Na2Cr2O, 2H2O can be crystallised._

_2Na2CrO4 + 2 H \(\rightarrow\) Na2Cr2O7 + 2 Na' + H2O_: The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, Na2Cr2O, 2H2O can be crystallised._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:621]

In the laboratory, a manganese (II) ion salt is oxidised by peroxodsulphate to permanganate,

2Mn2* + 5S2O3^2 + 8H2O - 2MnO4 + 10SO4^2 + 16H*

Potassium permanganate forms dark purple [almost black] crystals which are isostructural with those of KClO4. The salt is not very soluble in water (6.4 g/100 g of water at 293 R), but when heated it decomposes at 513 K.

2KMnO4 - R3MnO4 + MnO2 + O2

It has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour and its weak temperature dependent paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital theory which is beyond the present scope. The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral: the green manganate is paramagnetic with one unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic.

The \(\pi\)-bonding takes place by overlap of \(p\) orbitals of oxygen with \(d\) orbitals of manganese.

Acdified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide, iron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine. The half-reactions of reductants are:

COO

5Fe2* - 5 Fe3* + 5e^5

5NO2 + 5H2O - 5NO3 + 1OH* + 10e^10

10T - 5I2 + 10e^

The full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for KMnO4 to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever necessary.

If we represent the reduction of permanganate to manganate, manganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,

MnO4 + e^5 - MnO2* (E^0 = + 0.56 V)

MnO4 + 4H^+ 3e^5 - MnO2 + 2H2O (E^0 = + 1.69 V)

MnO4 + 8H^+ 5e^5 - MnO2* + 4H2O (E^0 = + 1.52 V)

We can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential, knetles of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at [H^] - 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow unless either manganese(II) ions are present or the temperature is raised.

A few important oxidising reactions of KMnO4 are given below:

1. In acid solutions: 1. [label=()]
2. Iodine is liberated from potassium iodide : 10T + 2MnO4 + 16H* 2Mn2* + 8H2O + 5I2
3. Fe2* ion (green) is converted to Fe2* (yellow): 5Fe2* + MnO4 + 8H* 2Mn2* + 4H2O + 5Fe43. Oxalate ion or oxalle acid is oxidised at 333 K: 5C2O4^-+2MnO4^+16H^->2Mn^2^+8H_2O+10CO_2
4. Hydrogen sulphide is oxidised, sulphur being precipitated: H2S->2H^+S^-255^-+2MnO4+16H^->2Mn^2^+8H_2O+SS
5. Suplhurous acid or sulphite is oxidised to a sulphate or sulphuric acid: 5SO3^-+2MnO4^+6H^->2Mn^2^+3H_2O+5SO4^-+
6. Nitrite is oxidised to nitrate: 5NO2^+2MnO4^+6H^->2Mn^2^+5NO3^+3H_2O
2. In neutral or faintly alkaline solutions: 1. A notable reaction is the oxidation of iodide to locate: 2MnO4^+H2O+\Gamma->2MnO2+2OH^+1O3^-+ 2Thosulphate is oxidised almost quantitatively to sulphate: 8MnO4^+3S2O3^-+H_2O->8MnO2+6SO4^-+2OH
3. Manganous salt is oxidised to MnO2; the presence of zinc sulphate or zinc oxide catalyses the oxidation: 2MnO4^+3Mn^2+2H_2O->5MnO2+4H^+

_Note_: Permanganate titrations in presence of hydrochloric acid are unsatisfactory since hydrochloric acid is oxidised to chlorine.

_Use_: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.

## 6 The inner transition elements (_f_-block)

The _f_-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.

The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 9.

#### 8.5.1 Electronic Configurations

It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic configuration with 6s\({}^{2}\) common but with variable occupancy of 4\(f\) level (Table 8.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form 4_f\({}^{n}\)_ (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).

#### 8.5.2 Atomic and Ionic Sizes

The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in M\({}^{\text{\tiny{s}}}\) ions (Fig. 8.6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one 4\(f\) electron by another is less than one 4 electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number.

The cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as _ lanthanoid contraction_, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of Zr (160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their occurrence together in nature and for the difficulty faced in their separation.

#### 8.5.3 Oxidation States

In the lanthanoids, La[III] and Ln[III] compounds are predominant species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or filled \(f\) subshell. Thus, the formation of Ce\({}^{\text{\tiny{v}}}\) is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common +3 state. The E\({}^{\text{\tiny{s}}}\) value for Ce\({}^{\text{\tiny{s}}}\)+/ Ce\({}^{\text{\tiny{s}}}\) is + 1.74 V which suggests that it can oxidate water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence Ce[IV] is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO\({}_{2}\). Eu\({}^{\text{\tiny{2s}}}\) is formed by losing the two s electrons and its_f\({}^{\text{\tiny{i}}}\)_ configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, Eu\({}^{\text{\tiny{2s}}}\) is a strong reducing agent changing to the common +3 state. Similarly Yb\({}^{\text{\tiny{3s}}}\) which has _f\({}^{\text{\tiny{1s}}}\)_ configuration is a reductant. Tb\({}^{\text{\tiny{v}}}\) has half-filled _f_-orbitals and is an oxidant. The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both +2 and +3 oxidation states.

Figure 8.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids

#### 8.5.4 General

All the lanthanoids are slivery white soft metals and tamish rapidly in air. The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.

Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of _f_electrons. Neither La\({}^{3}\) nor Lu\({}^{3+}\) ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because of the excitation within \(f\) level. The lanthanoid ions other than the _f_\({}^{0}\) type (La\({}^{3+}\) and Ce\({}^{4+}\)) and the _f_\({}^{14}\) type (Yb\({}^{2+}\) and Lu\({}^{3+}\)) are all paramagnetic. The paramagnetism rises to maximum in neodymium.

The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around 600 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), the second about 1200 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in 3\(d\) orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals \(f\) level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.

In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminum. Values for _E\({}^{0}\)_ for the half-reaction:

###### Summary

The _d_-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner \(d\) orbitals are progressively filled. The _f_-block is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block. _4f_ and 5f orbitals are progressively filled.

Corresponding to the filling of 3\(d\). 4\(d\) and 5\(d\) orbitals. three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as -high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of \(\{n-1\}\)_d_ electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per \(d\) orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction.

**Successive ionisation enthalpies** do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from \(\{n-1\}\)_d_ orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of \(\{n-1\}\)_d_ electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus. in addition to variable oxidation states. they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions. interstitial compounds and complexes.

The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electrosoltive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'. Of the first series. with the exception of copper. all the metals are relatively reactive.

The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore (MnO\({}_{3}\)) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxiding agents.

The two series of inner transition elements. lanthanoids and actinoids constitute the _f_-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals. 4\(f\). there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series lanthanoid contraction. This has far reacting consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some \(\{233\}\). The _d_- and _f_- Block Elementsoccasionally. The chemistry of the **actinoids** is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult.

There are many useful applications of the \(d\)- and \(f\)-block elements and their compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes, organic syntheses, etc.

These observations, together with the results of conductivity measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all, either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to the cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated as shown in Table 9.1, where the atoms within the square brackets form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these examples the secondary valences are six.

Note that the last two compounds in Table 9.1 have identical empirical formula, CoCl\({}_{3}\).4NH\({}_{3}\), but distinct properties. Such compounds are termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are:

1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages (valences)-primary and secondary.
2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions.
3. The secondary valences are non lonisable. These are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.
4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers.

In modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called coordination _polbhedra_. The species within the square bracket are coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square bracket are called counter ions.

He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of transition metals. Thus, [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{\pi}\), [CoCl(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{\pi}\) and [CoCl\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{\pi}\) are octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\)] and [PicCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{\pi}\) are tetrahedral and square planar, respectively.

#### 9.3.1 Formulas of Mononuclear Coordination Entities

The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:

1. The central atom is listed first.
2. The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.
3. Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.
4. The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic, their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations are also enclosed in parentheses.
5. There should be no space between the ligands and the metal within a coordination sphere.
6. When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the sign. For example, [Co(CN)g]P, [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)g]P, etc.
7. The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).

The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multulpliers. The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:

1. The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged coordination entities.
2. The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).
3. Names of the anionic ligands end in -o, those of neutral and cationic ligands are the same except aqua for H\({}_{2}\)O, ammine for NH\({}_{3}\), carbonyl for CO and nitrosyl for NO. These are placed within enclosing marks {}.
4. Prefixes mono, dl, trt, etc., are used to indicate the number of the individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris, tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in parentheses. For example, [NiCl\({}_{2}\)(PPh\({}_{3}\))] is named as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)ickel(II).
5. Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parentheses.
6. If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of the metal ends with the suffix -ate. For example, Co in a complex anion, [Co(SCN)g] is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin names are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrite for Fe.

Figure 9.5: Geometrical isomers (ds and trans) of [CoNH\({}_{d}\)Cl\({}_{d}\)].

This type of isomerism also arises when didentate ligands L-L [_e.g._, NH\({}_{2}\) CH\({}_{2}\) NH\({}_{2}\) (en]) are present in complexes of formula [MX\({}_{2}\)(L-L)\({}_{2}\)] (Fig. 9.4).

Another type of geometrical isomerism occurs in octahedral coordination entities of the type [Ma\({}_{3}\)b\({}_{3}\)] like [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)(NO\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)]. If three donor atoms of the same ligands occupy adjacent positions at the corners of an octahedral face, we have the facial (fac) isomer. When the positions are around the meridian of the octahedron, we get the meridional (mer) isomer (Fig. 9.5).

#### 9.4.2 Optical Isomerism

Optical isomers are mirror images that cannot be superimposed on one another. These are called as _ enantiomers_. The molecules or ions that cannot be superimposed are called _chiral_. The two forms are called _dextro (d)_ and _laevo (l)_ depending upon the direction they rotate the plane of polarised light in a polarimeter (_d_ rotates to the right, \(l\) to the left). Optical isomerism is common in octahedral complexes involving _didentate ligands_ (Fig. 9.6).

In a coordination entity of the type [PtCl\({}_{2}\)(en)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2*}\), only the _cis_-isomer shows optical activity (Fig. 9.7).

A simple example is provided by complexes containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS, which may bind through the nitrogen to give M-NCS or through sulphur to give M-SCN. Jorgensen discovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(NO\({}_{2}\))]Cl\({}_{2}\), which is obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through oxygen (-ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through nitrogen (-NO\({}_{2}\)). \\
* & This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex. An example is provided by [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]Cr(CN)\({}_{6}\), in which the NH\({}_{3}\) ligands are bound to Co\({}^{3n}\) and the CN\({}^{3}\) ligands to Cr\({}^{3n}\). In its coordination isomer [Cr(NH\({}_{3}\))]Co(CN)\({}_{6}\)], the NH\({}_{3}\) ligands are bound to Cr\({}^{3n}\) and the CN\({}^{3}\) ligands to Co\({}^{3n}\). \\
* & This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation isomers [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))SO\({}_{4}\)]Br and [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))Br]SO\({}_{4}\). \\ \end{tabular}

It is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from the knowledge of its magnetic behaviour on the basis of the valence bond theory.

In the diamagnetic octane dual complex, [Co(NH\({}_{4}\))]\({}^{8*}\), the cobalt ion is in \(\pm 3\) oxidation state and has the electronic configuration \(3d^{6}\). The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram.

Six pairs of electrons, one from each NH\({}_{4}\) molecule, occupy the six hybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation of this complex, since the inner \(d\) orbital (\(3d\)) is used in hybridisation, the complex, [Co(NH\({}_{4}\))]\({}^{8*}\) is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin paired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, [CoF\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{8*}\) uses outer orbital (\(4d\)) in hybridisation (\(sp^{3}d^{6}\)). It is thus called outer orbital or high spin or spin free complex. Thus:

In tetrahedral complexes one \(s\) and three \(p\) orbitals are hybridised to form four equivalent orbitals oriented tetrahedrally. This is illustrated below for [NiCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{8*}\). Here nickel is in +2 oxidation state and the ion has the electronic configuration \(3d^{6}\). The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram.

Each CT ion donates a pair of electrons. The compound is paramagnetic since it contains two unpaired electrons. Similarly, [Ni(CO)] has tetrahedral geometry but is diamagnetic since nickel is in zero oxidation state and contains no unpaired electron.

In the square planar complexes, the hybridisation involved is \(dsp^{2}\). An example is [Ni(CN),f]\({}^{2}\)-. Here nickel is in +2 oxidation state and has the electronic configuration 3\(d^{6}\). The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram:

The spin only magnetic moment of [MnBr\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2^{*}}\) is 5.9 BM. Predict the geometry of the complex ion?

Since the coordination number of Mn\({}^{2*}\) ion in the complex ion is 4, it will be either tetrahedral (\(sp^{3}\) hybridisation) or square planar (\(dsp^{2}\) hybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex ion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the \(d\) orbitals.

#### 9.5.3 Limitations of Valence Bond

The spin only magnetic moment of [MnBr\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2^{*}}\) is 5.9 BM. Predict the geometry of the complex ion?

Since the coordination number of Mn\({}^{2*}\) ion in the complex ion is 4, it will be either tetrahedral (\(sp^{3}\) hybridisation) or square planar (\(dsp^{2}\) hybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex ion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the \(d\) orbitals.

#### 9.5.4 Crystal Field Theory

The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated as point charges in case of anions or dipoles in case of neutral molecules. The five \(d\) orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have same energy, _i.e._, they are degenerate. This degeneracy is maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the degeneracy of the \(d\) orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the \(d\) orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.

1. Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities

In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal \(d\) orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal \(d\) orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the \(\hat{d}_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) and \(\hat{d}_{x^{2}}\) orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in energy; and the \(d_{y}\), \(d_{yz}\) and \(d_{xz}\) orbitals which are directed between the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the \(d\) orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, \(t_{26}\) set and two orbitals of higher energy, \(e_{6}\) set. This splitting of the general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below:

\(\Gamma\) < Br^ < SCN^ < CT < S^2 < F ^ < OH^ < C2O4^2 < H2O < NCS^ < eedia^4 < NH3 < en < CN^ < CO

Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the \(d\) orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single \(d\) electron occupies one of the lower energy \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}\) orbitals. In \(d^{2}\) and \(d^{3}\) coordination entities, the \(d\) electrons occupy the \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}\) orbitals singly in accordance with the Hund's rule. For \(d^{4}\) ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could either enter the \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}\) level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the \(e_{\mathrm{g}}\) level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting, \(\Delta_{\mathrm{o}}\) and the pairing energy, P (P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single orbital). The two options are:

* If \(\Delta_{\mathrm{o}}<\) P, the fourth electron enters one of the \(e_{\mathrm{g}}\) orbitals giving the configuration \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}^{\mathrm{2g}}e_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{1}}\). Ligands for which \(\Delta_{\mathrm{o}}<\) P are known as _weak field ligands_ and form high spin complexes.
* If \(\Delta_{\mathrm{o}}>\) P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth electron to occupy a \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}\) orbital with configuration \(t_{\mathrm{2g}}^{\mathrm{2g}}e_{\mathrm{g}}^{\mathrm{0}}\). Ligands which produce this effect are known as _strong field ligands_ and form low spin complexes.

Calculations show that \(d^{4}\) to \(d^{\mathrm{r}}\) coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.

#### 9.5.5 Colour in

In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours. This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the complex, it appears red, Table 9.3 gives the relationship of the different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.

The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex \(\left[\Gamma\mathrm{i}\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}\right]^{3^{\mathrm{+}}}\), which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex where the single electron (\(\Gamma\mathrm{i}^{3+}\) is a \(3d^{1}\) system) in the metal \(d\) orbital is in the \(t_{2g}\) level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state available for the electron is the empty \(e_{g}\) level. If light corresponding to the energy of yellow-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite the electron from \(t_{2g}\) level to the \(e_{g}\) level (\(t_{2g}\,e_{g}^{o}\to t_{2g}e_{g}\)). Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 9.10). The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to \(d\)-\(d\) transition of the electron.

The crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation, structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the electrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are beyond the scope of the present study.

The homoleptic carbonyls (compounds containing carbonyl ligands only) are formed by most of the transition metals. These carbonyls have simple, well defined structures. TetracarbonyllikeI(0) is tetrahedral, pentacarbonyliron(0) is trigonalbipy pyramidal while hexacarbonyl chromium(0) is octahedral.

Decacarbonyldimanganese(0) is made up of two square pyramidal Mn(CO)\({}_{6}\) units joined by a Mn - Mn bond. Octacarbonyldicobalt(0) has a Co - Co bond bridged by two CO groups (Fig.9.13).

### Stability of Coordination Compounds

The stability of a complex in solution refers to the degree of association between the two species involved in the state of equilibrium. The magnitude of the (stability or formation) equilibrium constant for the association, quantitatively expresses the stability. Thus, if we have a reaction of the type:

M + 4L \(\rightleftharpoons\) ML\({}_{4}\)

then the larger the stability constant, the higher the proportion of ML\({}_{4}\) that exists in solution. Free metal ions rarely exist in the solution so that M will usually be surrounded by solvent molecules which will compete with the ligand molecules, L and be successively replaced by them. For simplicity, we generally ignore these solvent molecules and write four stability constants as follows:

M + L ML \(\rightleftharpoons\) ML\({}_{4}\) K\({}_{1}\) = [ML]/[ML][L] ML\({}_{4}\) ML\({}_{2}\) + L \(\rightleftharpoons\) ML\({}_{2}\) K\({}_{2}\) = [ML\({}_{2}\)]/[ML][L] ML\({}_{2}\) + L \(\rightleftharpoons\) ML\({}_{3}\) K\({}_{3}\) = [ML\({}_{3}\)]/[ML\({}_{2}\)][L] ML\({}_{3}\) + L \(\rightleftharpoons\) ML\({}_{4}\) K\({}_{4}\) = [ML\({}_{4}\)]/[ML\({}_{3}\)][L]

where \(K_{1}\), \(K_{2}\), etc., are referred to as stepwise stability constants. Alternatively, we can write the overall stability constant thus:

M + 4L ML\({}_{4}\) \(\beta_{4}\) = [ML\({}_{4}\)]/[M][L]\({}^{4}\)

The stepwise and overall stability constant are therefore related as follows:

\(\beta_{4}\) = \(K_{1}\times K_{2}\times K_{3}\times K_{4}\) or more generally,

\(\beta_{4}\) = [ML\({}_{4}\)]/[ML\({}_{4}\)][L]

Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination compound of iron. Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamine, the anti-pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among the other compounds of biological importance with coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxy peptidase A and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).
* Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes. Examples include rhodium complex, [(Ph2P)3RhCl], a Wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes.
* Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more smoothly and evenly from solutions of the complexes, [Ag(CN)2] and [Au(CN)2]- than from a solution of simple metal ions.
* In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by washing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed AgBr to form a complex ion, [Ag(S2O3)2]-.
* There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems. Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands D-penkillamine and deserrioxime B via the formation of coordination compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth of tumours. Examples are: cis-platin and related compounds.

Summary

The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years. advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.

The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism. Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.

The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success. the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.

The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges), on the degeneracy of \(d\) orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The splitting of the \(d\) orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability

highlight the environmental effects of polyhalogen compounds.

The replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic or aromatic, by halogen atom(s) results in the formation of alkyl halide (haloalkane) and aryl halide (haloaren), respectively. Haloalkanes contain halogen atom(s) attached to the \(sp^{3}\) hybridised carbon atom of an alkyl group whereas haloarenes contain halogen atom(s) attached to \(sp^{2}\) hybridised carbon atom(s) of an aryl group. Many halogen containing organic compounds occur in nature and some of these are clinically useful. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as well as in day-to-day life. They are used as solvents for relatively non-polar compounds and as starting materials for the synthesis of wide range of organic compounds. Chlorine containing antibiotic, _chloramphenicol_, produced by soil microorganisms is very effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. Our body produces iodine containing hormone, _throroxine_, the deficiency of which causes a disease called _goiter_. Synthetic halogen compounds, _viz._ chloroquine is used for the treatment of malaria; halothane is used as an anaesthetic during surgery. Certain fully fluorinated compounds are being considered as potential blood substitutes in surgery.

In this Unit, you will study the important methods of preparation, physical and chemical properties and uses of organohalogen compounds.

Melting and boiling pointsMethyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals) are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.

The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different halides is depicted in Fig. 10.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RD\(>\) RB\(>\) RCl\(>\) RF. This is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the magnitude of van der Waal forces increases.

The boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase in branching (Unit 12, Class XI). For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest boiling point among the three isomers.

\[\begin{array}{cc}\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}Br}&\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}CHCH_{ 3}}&\mathrm{H_{3}C-C-CH_{3}}\\ &\mathrm{Br}&\mathrm{Br}\\ \mathrm{b.p./K}&375&364&346\end{array}\]

Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same. However, the _para_-isomers are high melting as compared to their _ortho_- and _meta_-isomers. It is due to symmetry of _para_-isomers that fits in crystal lattice better as compared to _ortho_- and _meta_-isomers.

optical activity was associated with the three dimensional arrangements of atoms (configurations) in two types of crystals. Dutch scientist, _J. Van't Hoff_ and French scientist, _C. Le Bel_ in the same year (1874), independently argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies) around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents attached to that carbon are different, such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule is responsible for the optical activity in such organic compounds.

The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to their mirror images and can be superimposed. However, many objects are non superimposable on their mirror images. For example, your left and right hand look similar but if you put your left hand on your right hand, they do not coincide. The objects which are non-superimposable on their mirror image (like a pair of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is known as chirality. While the objects, which are, superimposable on their mirror images are called achiral.

The above test of molecular chirality can be applied to organic molecules by constructing models and its mirror images or by drawing three dimensional structures and attempting to superimpose them in our minds. There are other aids, however, that can assist us in recognising chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of a single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider two simple molecules propan-2-ol and butan-2-ol and their mirror images.

As you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol does not contain an asymmetric carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not different. Thus it is an achiral molecule.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:678]

In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken, the product will have the same general configuration of groups around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an example, the reaction that takes place when (-)-2-methylbutanan-1-ol is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.

If (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention of configuration.

If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion of configuration.

If a 50:50 mixture of the above two is obtained then the process is called racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will rotate light in the direction opposite to another.

[FIGURE:SNow let us have a fresh look at S\({}_{x}\)1 and S\({}_{x}\)2 mechanisms by taking examples of optically active alkyl halides.

In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a result of S\({}_{x}\)2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When (-)-2-bromoate is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide, (+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the -OH group occupying the position opposite to what bromide had occupied.

Thus, S\({}_{x}\)2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by inversion of configuration.

In case of optically active alkyl halides, S\({}_{x}\)1 reactions are accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being \(sp^{2}\) hybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be accomplished from either side resulting in a mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the -OH attaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having opposite configuration (the -OH attaching on the side opposite to halide ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (\(\ddagger\))-butanol-2-ol.

### 2. Elimination reactions

When a haloalkane with \(\beta\)-hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen atom from \(\beta\)-carbon and a halogen atom from the \(\alpha\)-carbon atom. As a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since \(\beta\)-hydrogen atom is involved in elimination, it is often called \(\beta\)-elimination.

C:\(\backslash\)Chemistry-12Unit-10.pmd 28.02.07If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to the availability of more than one \(\alpha\)-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as _"in dehydrodiagonalization reactions, the preferred product is that alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms."_ Thus, 2-bromopentane gives pent-2-ene as the major product.

* _Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C--X bond:_ In haloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp\({}^{2}\)-hybridised.

The sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C--X bond more tightly than sp\({}^{3}\)-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with less s-character. Thus, C--Cl bond length in haloalkane is 177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution reaction.
* _Instability of phenyl cation:_ In case of haloarenes, the phenyl cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised by resonance and therefore, S\({}_{\rm N}\)1 mechanism is ruled out.
* Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.

_Replacement by hydroxyl group_Chlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure of 300 atmospheres.

The presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO\({}_{\rm J}\)) at _ortho_- and _para_-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes.

The effect is pronounced when (-NO_2 group is introduced at _ortho_- and _para_- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is observed by the presence of electron withdrawing group at _meta_-position. Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted:

Can you think why does NO2 group show its effect only at _ortho_- and _para_- positions and not at _meta_- position?

As shown, the presence of nitro group at _ortho_- and _para_-positions withdraws the electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile on haloarene. The carbonation thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative charge appeared at _ortho_- and _para_- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is stabilised by -NO2 group while in case of _meta_-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating structures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the -NO2 group. Therefore, the presence of nitro group at _meta_- position does not stabilise the negative charge and no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of -NO2 group at _meta_-position.

The chemical may irritate the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air, it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the ozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays, leading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and possible disruption of the immune system.
* 10.7.5 **Freons**: The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non-corrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CC\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{3}\)) is one of the most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By 1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance (Unit 14, Class XI).
* 10.7.6 **p.p'-Dichlo-**: DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973, although it is still in use in some other parts of the world.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

_Alcohols, phenols and ethers are the basic compounds for the formation of detergents, antiseptics and fragrances, respectively._

You have learnt that substitution of one or more hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely new compound having altogether different properties and applications. **Aleohols** and **phenols** are formed when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and aromatic respectively, is replaced by -OH group. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all made up of compounds containing -OH groups. Just think of life without paper; no note-books, books, newspapers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The magazines carrying beautiful photographs and interesting stories would disappear from our life. It would have been really a different world.

An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH) group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an aliphatic system (CH\({}_{3}\)OH) while a phenol contains -OH group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an aromatic system (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH).

The substitution of a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group (R-O/Ar-O) yields another class of compounds known as 'ethers', for example, CH\({}_{3}\)OCH\({}_{3}\) (dimethyl ether). You may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by

Table 1.2: Common and IUPAC names of some EthersIf both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix 'di' is added before the alkyl group. For example, C2H5O2H5 is diethyl ether.

According to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an -OR or -OAr group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups, respectively. The larger (R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon.

The names of a few ethers are given as examples in Table 1.2.

In alcohols, the oxygen of the -OH group is attached to carbon by a sigma (\(\sigma\) ) bond formed by the overlap of a \(sp^{3}\) hybridised orbital of carbon with a \(sp^{3}\) hybridised orbital of oxygen. Fig. 1.1 depicts structural aspects of methanol, phenol and methoxymethane.

11.4.3 Physical Properties

Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply modify these properties.

Boiling Points

The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols, the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain (because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface area).

The -OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding as shown below:

It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.

The reaction with carboxylic acid and acid anhydride is carried out in the presence of a small amount of concentrated sulphuric acid. The reaction is reversible, and therefore, water is removed as soon as it is formed. The reaction with acid chloride is carried out in the presence of a base (pyridine) so as to neutralise HCl which is formed during the reaction. It shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side. The introduction of acetyl (CH\({}_{3}\)CO) group in alcohols or phenols is known as acetylation. Acetylation of salicylic acid produces aspirin.

The difference in reactivity of three classes of alcohols with HCl distinguishes them from one another (Lucas test). Alcohols are soluble in Lucas reagent (conc. HCl and ZnCl\({}_{2}\)) while their halides are immiscible and produce turbidity in solution. In case of tertiary alcohols, turbidity is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature.
2. _Reaction with phosphorus trihalides:_ Alcohols are converted to alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer Unit 10, Class XII).

1. _Electrophilic aromatic substitution_

In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are electrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 13, Class XI). The -OH group attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to _ortho_ and _para_ positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to the resonance effect caused by -OH group. The resonance structures are shown under acidity of phenols.

Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place in phenol are as follows:

_(0) Nituration:_ With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K), phenol yields a mixture of _ortho_ and _para_ introphenols.

The _ortho_ and _para_ isomers can be separated by steam distillation. \(o\)-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding while \(p\)-nitrophenol is less volatile due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association of molecules.

_2, 4, 6 - Trintrophenol is a strong acid due to the presence of three electron withdrawing -NO\({}_{x}\)groups which facilitate the release of hydrogen ion._

With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to 2,4,6-trintrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor.

Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric acid to get 2,4,6-trintrophenol. Can you write the equations of the reactions involved?

The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their boiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of comparable molecular masses but are much lower than the boiling points of alcohols as shown in the following cases:

Alkyl aryl ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl halide molecules.

Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl halide.

Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same manner.

The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows: HI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated HI or HBr at high temperature.

**Alcohols and phenols are classified (i) on the basis of the number of hydroxyl groups and (ii) according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom, \(sp^{3}\) or \(sp^{2}\) to which the -OH group is attached. Ethers are classified on the basis of groups attached to the oxygen atom.**

**Alcohols may be prepared (1) by hydration of alkenes (i) in presence of an acid and (ii) by hydrocarbon-oxidation reaction (2) from carbonyl compounds by (i) catalytic reduction and (ii) the action of Grignard reagents. Phenols may be prepared by (1) substitution of (i) halogen atom in haloarenes and (ii) sulphonic acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by -OH group (2) by hydrolysis of diazont salts and (3) industrially from cumene.**

**Alcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses. The ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water makes them solubility in it.**

**Alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it. Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are resistant to oxidation.**

**The presence of -OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions due to resonance effect. Reimer-Tiemann reaction of phenol yields salicaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol undergoes Kolbe's reaction.**

**Ethers may be prepared by (i) dehydration of alcohols and (ii) Williamson synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass. The C-O bond in ethers can be cleaved by hydrogen halides.

In the previous Unit, you have studied organic compounds with functional groups containing carbon-oxygen single bond. In this Unit, we will study about the organic compounds containing carbon-oxygen double bond (>C=O) called carboxyl group, which is one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry.

In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to a carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded to two carbon atoms. The carbonyl compounds in which carbonyl group is bonded to oxygen are known as carboxylic acids, and their derivatives (e.g. esters, anhydrides) while in compounds where carbon is attached to nitrogen and to halogens are called amides and acyl halides respectively. The general formulas of these classes of compounds are given below:

Table 12.1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Aldehydes and KetonesThe carbonyl carbon atom is sp\({}^{2}\)-hybridised and forms three sigma (\(\bullet\)) bonds. The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its \(p\)-orbital and forms a \(\pi\)-bond with oxygen by overlap with \(p\)-orbital of an oxygen. In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs. Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the same plane and the \(\pi\)-electron cloud is above and below this plane. The bond angles are approximately 120 as expected of a trigonal coplanar structure (Figure 12.1).

The carbon-oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl carbon is an electrophilic (Lewis acid), and carbonyl oxygen, a nucleophilic (Lewis base) centre. Carbonyl compounds have substantial dipole moments and are polar than ethers. The high polarity of the carbonyl group is explained on the basis of resonance involving a neutral (A) and a dipolar (B) structures as shown.

### Preparation of Aldehydes

Some important methods for the preparation of aldehydes and \(\langle\)_cstones_ and ketones are as follows:

1. _By oxidation of alcohols_

Aldehydes and ketones are generally prepared by oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols, respectvely (Unit 11, Class XII).
2. _By dehydrogenation of alcohols_

This method is suitable for volatile alcohols and is of industrial application. In this method alcohol vapours are passed over heavy metal catalysts (Ag or Cu). Primary and secondary alcohols give aldehydes and ketones, respectively (Unit 11, Class XII).
3. _From hydrocarbons_

(\(\bullet\)) _By ozonolysis of alkenes_: As we know, ozonolysis of alkenes followed by reaction with zinc dust and water gives aldehydes,

Since aldehydes and ketones both possess the carbonyl functional group, they undergo similar chemical reactions.

1. _Nucleophilic addition reactions_

Contrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes (refer Unit 13, Class XI), the aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.

(i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions

A nucleophilic attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar carbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular to the plane of \(sp^{2}\) hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig. 12.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from \(sp^{2}\) to \(sp^{3}\) in this process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is produced. This intermediate captures a proton from the reaction medium to give the electrically neutral product. The net result is addition of Nu~ and H~ across the carbon oxygen double bond as shown in Fig. 12.2.

(ii) Reactivity

Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic reasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large substituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to carbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such substituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of the carbonyl more effectively than in former.

(iii) Reactivity

Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in nucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer.

The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl group is reduced in benzaldehyde due to resonance as shown below and hence it is less reactive than propanal.

* _Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions:_
* _Addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN):_ Aldehydes and ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very slowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed by a base and the generated cyanide ion (CN) being a stronger nucleophilic readily adds to carbonyl compounds to yield corresponding cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are useful synthetic intermediates.
* _Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite:_ Sodium hydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and ketones due to ferric reasons. The position of the equilibrium signal carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral acid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and purification of aldehydes.
* _Addition of Grignard reagents:_ (refer Unit 11, Class XII).
* _Addition of alcohols:_ Aldehydes react with one equivalent of monohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride to yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemicatels, which further react with one more molecule of alcohol to give \(a\)\(gem\)-dialkoxy compound known as acetal as shown in the reaction.
* _Kotones react with ethylene glycol under similar conditions to form cyclic products known as ethylene glycol ketals. Dry hydrogen chloride protonated the oxygen of the carbonyl compounds and therefore, increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon facilitating_
the nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol. Acetals and ketals are hydrolys with aqueous mineral acids to yield corresponding aldehydes and ketones respectively.
* _Addition of ammonia and its derivatives_: Nucleophiles, such as ammonia and its derivatives H\({}_{x}\)N-Z add to the carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones. The reaction is reversible and catalysed by acid. The equilibrium favours the product formation due to rapid dehydration of the intermediate to form >C=N-Z.

## 2 Reduction

1. Reduction to alcohols: Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to primary and secondary alcohols respectively by sodium borohydride (NaBH\({}_{4}\)) or lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH\({}_{4}\)) as well as by catalytic hydrogenation (Unit 11, Class XII).
2. Reduction to hydrocarbons: The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones is reduced to CH\({}_{2}\) group on treatment with zinc-amalgam and concentrated hydrochloric acid [Clemmensen

* _Hint_: Consider steric effect and electronic effect.
* _Predict the products of the following reactions:_
* _Lidehydes and Ketones_ In chemical industry aldehydes and ketones are used as solvents, starting materials and reagents for the synthesis of other products. Formaldehyde is well known as formalin (40%) solution used to preserve biological specimens and to prepare bakelite (a phenol-formaldehyde resin), urea-formaldehyde glues and other polymeric products. Acetaldehyde is used primarily as a starting material in the manufacture of acetic acid, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, polymers and drugs. Benzaldehyde is used in perfumery and in dye industries. Acetone and ethyl methyl ketone are common industrial solvents. Many aldehydes and ketones, e.g., butyraldehyde, vanillin, acetophenone, camphor, etc. are well known for their odours and flavours.
* _Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids_

#### Carboxylic Acids

Carbon compounds containing a carboxyl functional group, -COOH are called carboxylic acids. The carboxyl group, consists of a _carbonyl_ group attached to a _hydroxxyl_ group, hence its name _carboxyl_. Carboxylic acids may be aliphatic (RCOOH) or aromatic (ArCOOH) depending on the group, alkyl or aryl, attached to carboxylic carbon. Large number of carboxylic acids are found in nature. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic acids (C\({}_{12}-\) C\({}_{18}\)) known as **fatty acids,** occur in natural fats as esters of glycerol. Carboxylic acids serve as starting material for several other important organic compounds such as anhydrides, esters, acid chlorides, amides, etc.

#### 12.6.1 Ionenclature and Structure of Carboxyl Group

\begin{tabular}{c p{142.3pt}}
**12.6.1** & \\
**Nomenclature** & Since carboxylic acids are amongst the earliest organic compounds to be isolated from nature, a large number of them are known by their common names. The common names end with the suffix -_ic_ acid and have been derived from Latin or Greek names of their natural sources. For example, formic acid (HCOOH) was first obtained from red ants (Latin: _formica_ means ant), acetic acid (CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) from vinegar (Latin: _acetum_, means vinegar), butyric acid (CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)COOH) from rancid butter (Latin: _buttyrum_, means butter). \\ \end{tabular}

In the IUPAC system, aliphatic carboxylic acids are named by replacing the ending -_e_ in the name of the corresponding alkane with - _oic acid_. In numbering the carbon chain, the carboxylic carbon is numbered one. For naming compounds containing more than one carboxyl group, the ending -_e_ of the alkane is retained. The number of carboxyl groups are indicated by adding the multiplicative prefix, _di, tri_, etc. to the term **oi**. The position of -COOH groups are indicated by the arabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix. Some of the carboxylic acids along with their common and IUPAC names are listed in Table 12.3.

Carboxylic acids are also prepared from aldehydes by the use of mild oxidising agents (Section 12.4).
2. _From alkylbenzenes_ Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of alkyl benzenes with chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group irrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl groups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected. Suitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids with these oxidising reagents (refer Unit 13, Class XI).

3. _From nitriles and amides_ Nitriles are hydrolys to amides and then to acids in the presence of H\({}^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}\) or OH as catalyst. Mild reaction conditions are used to stop the reaction at the amide stage.

4. _From Grignard reagents_ Grignard reagents react with carbon dioxide (dry ice) to form salts of carboxylic acids which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acids after acidification with mineral acid.

R-Mg-X + O=C=O \(\xrightarrow{\text{Dry ether}}\) R \(\leftarrow\)\(\xrightarrow{\text{O}}\)\(\xrightarrow{\text{H,O'}}\) RCOOH

As we know, the Grignard reagents and nitriles can be prepared from alkyl halides (refer Unit 10, Class XII). The above methods

\begin{tabular}{c c} _12.8 Physical Properties_ & Aliphatic carboxylic acids upto nine carbon atoms are colourless liquids at room temperature with unpleasant odours. The higher acids are wax like solids and are practically odourless due to their low volatility. Carboxylic acids are higher boiling liquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of comparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive association of carboxylic acid molecules through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are not broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact, most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase or in the aprotic solvents. \\ \end{tabular}

Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four carbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases with increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher carboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to the increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon part. Benzoic acid, the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid is nearly insoluble in cold water. Carboxylic acids are also soluble in less polar organic solvents like benzene, ether, alcohol, chloroform, etc.

\begin{tabular}{c c} _12.9 Chemical Reactions_ & The reaction of carboxylic acids are classified as follows: \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} _12.9.1 Reactions_ & _Acidity_ \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} _12.

For the above reaction:

\[K_{\alpha}=\frac{\left[\text{H},\text{O}\right]\left[\text{RCOO}\right]}{\left[ \text{H},\text{O}\right]\left[\text{RCOOH}\right]}\qquad\qquad K_{\alpha}=K_{ \alpha\gamma}\left[\text{H}_{\text{z}}\text{O}\right]=\frac{\left[\text{H}, \text{O}\right]\left[\text{RCOO}\right]}{\left[\text{RCOOH}\right]}\]

where \(K_{\alpha\gamma}\) is equilibrium constant and \(K_{\alpha}\) is the acid dissociation constant.

For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by its \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) value rather than its \(K_{\alpha}\) value.

\[\text{p}K_{\alpha}=-\text{ log }K_{\alpha}\]

The \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) of hydrochloric acid is -7.0, where as \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) of trifluoroacetic acid (the strongest organic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are 0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively.

Smaller the \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\), the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton donor). Strong acids have \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) values < 1, the acids with \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) values between 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak acids have \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids have \(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) values >15.

Carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger acids than alcohols and many simple phenols (\(\text{p}K_{\alpha}\) is -16 for ethanol and 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic organic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why phenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic acids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate base of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabllised by two equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more electronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide ion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in phenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the negative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in carboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen atom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 11, Class XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide ion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.

_Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:_ Substituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus, also affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the conjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by inductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups decrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.

**Mechanism of esterification of carboxylic acids:** The esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols is a kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the alcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group into \(\neg\)OH\({}_{2}\)group, which, being a better leaving group, is elliminated as neutral water molecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester.

## 3 Reactions with PCL\({}_{8}\), PCI\({}_{3}\) and SOC\({}_{2}\)

The hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols and is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCI\({}_{8}\), PCI\({}_{3}\) or SOCI\({}_{2}\). Thionyl chloride (SOCI\({}_{2}\)) is preferred because the other two products are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the purification of the products easier.

## 4 Reaction with ammonia

Carboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which on further heating at high temperature give amides. For example:

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{CH}_{5}\text{COOH}+\text{NH}_{3}&\text{CH}_{3} \text{COONH}_{i}&\text{\Delta}&\text{CH}_{5}\text{CONH}_{2}\\ \text{Ammonium acetate}&-\text{H}_{2}\text{O}&\text{Acetamide}\\ \text{COOH}&+&\text{NH}_{3}&\text{COONH}_{i}&\text{CONH}_{2}\\ \text{Ammonium benzoate}&\text{Benzamide}\end{array}\]

2. _Ring substitution_

Aromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions in which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta-directing group. They however, do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (because the carboxyl group is deactivating and the catalyst aluminium chloride (Lewis acid) gets bonded to the carboxyl group).

**12.8** & Which acid of each pair shown here would you expect to be stronger?ammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The \(\alpha\)-hydrogens in aldehydes and ketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one \(\alpha\)-hydrogen, undergo **Aldol** condensation in the presence of a base to give \(\alpha\)-hydroxyaldehydes (alolol) and \(\alpha\)-hydroxyalcones(kectol), respectively. Aldehydes having no \(\alpha\)-hydrogen undergo **Cannizzaro** reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH\({}_{4}\), LiAlH\({}_{4}\), or by catalytic hydrogenation. The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group by **Clemmensen reduction** or **Wolf-Kishner reduction**. Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as **Tolles**' reagent and **Fehling's reagent**. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from ketons. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes and alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with carbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation of alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH\({}_{4}\), or better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo \(\alpha\)-halogenation with Cl\({}_{2}\) and Br\({}_{2}\) in the presence of red phosphorus (**Heill-Volhard Zelinsky reaction**).

## 13.1 Structure of Antines

### 13.1 Structure of Antines

Ames constitute an important class of organic compounds derived by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of ammonia molecule by alkyl/aryl group(s). In nature, they occur among proteins, vitamins, alkaloids and hormones. Synthetic examples include polymers, dyestuffs and drugs. Two biologically active compounds, namely adrenaline and ephedrine, both containing secondary amino group, are used to increase blood pressure. Novocain, a synthetic amino compound, is used as an anaesthetic in dentistry. Benadryl, a well known antihistamine drug also contains tertiary amino group. Quaternary ammonium salts are used as surfactants. Diazoium salts are intermediates in the preparation of a variety of aromatic compounds including dyes. In this Unit, you will learn about amines and diazonium salts.

## 1.1 Amines

Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia, obtained by replacement of one, two or all the three hydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups.

For example:

Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and carries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals in amines are therefore, sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised and the geometry of amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or carbon depending upon the composition of the amines. The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an unshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of unshared pair of electrons, the angle C-N-E, (where E is

It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming arylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix 'e' of arena is replaced by 'amine'. Thus in IUPAC system, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)-NH\({}_{2}\) is named as benzemamine. Common and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are given in Table 13.1.

### Gabriel phthalimide synthesis

Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines. Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide followed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary amine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide.

You may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the \(K_{\!s}\) values of amines on the basis of +I or -I effect of the substituents present in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like solvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength of amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following paragraphs.

_Structure-basicity relationship of amines_

Basicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of an amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by accepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is relative to the amine, more basic is the amine.

_(a) Alkanamines versus ammonia_

Let us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with a proton to compare their basicity.

Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it (R) pushes electrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron pair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover, the substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised due to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl group. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia. Thus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with increase in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in the gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous phase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine > primary amine > NH\({}_{\!s}\). The trend is not regular in the aqueous state as evident by their pK\({}_{\!s}\) values given in Table 13.3. In the aqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised not only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The order of stability of ions are as follows:Greater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger should be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity of aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which is opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the alkyl group is small, like -CH3 group, there is no steric hindrance to H-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH3 group, there will be steric hindrance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of the alkyl group, e.g., from -CH3 to -C2H3 results in change of the order of basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive effect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which decides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The order of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl substituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:

(C2H3)J2NH > (C2H3)J3N > C2H3NH2 > NH3 (CH3H3NH2 > CH3H3N > NH3 (_b_) _Arplamines versus ammonia_

pK3 value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in aniline or other arylamines, the -NH2 group is attached directly to the benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen atom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making it less available for protonation. If you write different resonating structures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance hybrid of the following five structures.

On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton can have only two resonating structures (kekule).

We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater is the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating structures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton acceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines would be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it is observed that electron releasing groups like -OCH3, -CH3 increase basic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like -NO2, -SO3, -COOH, -X decrease it.

## 4 _Carbylamine reaction_

Aliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform and ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines which are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines do not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine reaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines.

## 5 _Reaction with nitrous acid_

Three classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is prepared _in situ_ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.

1. Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic diazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas quantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is used in estimation of amino acids and proteins.

R\(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) + HNO\({}_{2}\) \(\frac{\text{NaNO}_{2}+\text{HCl}}{\text{R}-\)N\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) + 3KCl + 3H\({}_{2}\)O
2. Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures (273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of compounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds discussed in Section 13.7.

C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\) - NH\({}_{2}\) \(\frac{\text{NaNO}_{2}+\text{HCl}}{273-278\text{K}}\) \(C_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\) - \(\stackrel{{\text{N}}}{{\text{N}}}{{\text{C}}}\) + NaCl + 2H\({}_{2}\)O

Aniline

Enzenediazonium

chloride

Secondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a different manner.

## 6 _Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride_

Benzenesulphonyl chloride (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)SO\({}_{2}\)Cl), which is also known as Hinsberg's reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to form sulphonamides.

(a) The reaction of benzenesulfphonyl chloride with primary amine yields N\(-\)CHlylbenzenesulphonyl amide.

(b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N\(-\)diethylbenzenesulfphonamide is formed.

(c):Chemistry-12Unit-13.pmd 28.02.07Since N, N-diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence insoluble in alkali.
3. Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride. This property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride in a different manner is used for the distinction of primary, secondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a mixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl chloride is replaced by \(p\)-toluenesulfphonyl chloride.
7. _Electrophilic substitution_ You have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five structures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in these structures? _Ortho_- and _para_-positions to the -NH2 group become centres of high electron density. Thus -NH2 group is _ortho_ and _para_ directing and a powerful activating group.

_(a) Bromination:_ Aniline reacts with bromine water at room temperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline.

The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution reactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity. Substitution tends to occur at _ortho_- and _para_-positions. If we have to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can the activating effect of -NH2 group be controlled? This can be done by protecting the -NH2 group by acetylation with acetic anhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed by hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine.

## II. Diazonium salts

The diazonium salts have the general formula \(\rm R\,\dot{N}_{2}\,\,\ddot{X}\) where R stands for an aryl group and \(\rm\ddot{X}\) ion may be \(\rm C\,\dot{Cl}\) Br, \(\rm\ddot{ISO}_{4}^{-}\). \(\rm\,\dot{BF}_{4}^{-}\), etc. They are named by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon from which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as chloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The \(\rm\dot{N}_{2}\) group is called diazonium group. For example, \(\rm C_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)\(\rm\dot{N}_{2}\,\,\ddot{Cl}\) is named as benzenediazonium chloride and \(\rm C_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)N\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\)H\({}_{5}\)SO\({}_{4}^{-}\) is known as benzenediazonium hydrogensulphate.

Primary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts (refer to Section 13.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazoonium salts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures (273-278 K). The stability of arenediazoonium ion is explained on the basis of resonance.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

* define the biomolecules like carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids;
* classify carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and vitamins on the basis of their structures;
* explain the difference between DNA and RNA;
* appreciate the role of biomolecules in biosystem.

_"It is the harmonious and synchronous progress of chemical reactions in body which leads to life"._

A living system grows, sustains and reproduces itself. The most amazing thing about a living system is that it is composed of non-living atoms and molecules. The pursuit of knowledge of what goes on chemically within a living system falls in the domain of _biochemistry_. Living systems are made up of various complex biomolecules like carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, etc. Proteins and carbohydrates are essential constituents of our food. These biomolecules interact with each other and constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In addition, some simple molecules like vitamins and mineral salts also play an important role in the functions of organisms. Structures and functions of some of these biomolecules are discussed in this Unit.

### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large group of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common examples are came sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of them have a general formula, C\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{\mathrm{y}}\), and were considered as hydrates of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example, the molecular formula of glucose (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)) fits into this general formula, C\({}_{6}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{\mathrm{6}}\). But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be classified as carbohydrates. Acetic acid (CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) fits into this general formula, C\({}_{2}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\) but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly, rhamnose, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{\mathrm{5}}\) is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition. A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific functional groups. Chemically, _the carbohydrates may be defined as optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds which produce such units on hydrolysis_. Some of the carbohydrates,

5. Acetylation of glucose with acetic anhydride gives glucose pentaacetate which confirms the presence of five -OH groups. Since it exists as a stable compound, five -OH groups should be attached to different carbon atoms.
6. On oxidation with nitric acid, glucose as well as gluconic acid both yield a dicarboxylic acid, saccharic acid. This indicates the presence of a primary alcoholic (-OH) group in glucose.

The exact spatial arrangement of different --OH groups was given by Fischer after studying many other properties. Its configuration is correctly represented as I. So gluconic acid is represented as II and saccharic acid as III.

Glucose is correctly named as D(+)-glucose. 'D' before the name of glucose represents the configuration whereas '(+)' represents dextrorotatory nature of the molecule. It may be remembered that 'D' and 'L' have no relation with the optical activity of the compound. The meaning of D- and L- notations is given as follows.

The letters 'D' or 'L' before the name of any compound indicate the relative configuration of a particular stereoisomer. This refers to their relation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric forms as shown below.

C:\(\backslash\)Chemistry-12\(\backslash\)Unit-14.pmd 28.02.07All those compounds which can be chemically correlated to (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D-configuration whereas those which can be correlated to (-) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have L--configuration. For assigning the configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon atom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) _glucose_, --OH on the lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable to (+) glyceraldehyde, so it is assigned D-configuration. For this comparison, the structure is written in a way that most oxidised carbon is at the top.

#### 14.1.5 Cyclic Structure of Glucose

The structure (I) of glucose explained most of its properties but the following reactions and facts could not be explained by this structure.

1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give 2,4-DNP test, Schiff's test and it does not form the hydrogenesisulphite addition product with NaHSO3.
2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine indicating the absence of free --CHO group.
3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are named as \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). The \(\alpha\)-form glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by crystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while the \(\beta\)-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and saturated aqueous solution at 371 K.

This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure (I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the --OH groups may add to the --CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was found that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which --OH at C-5 is involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of --CHO group and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below. These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:788]

You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different monosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an oxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage between two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called _glycosidic linkage_.

1. _Sucrose_: One of the common disaccharides is **sucrose** which on hydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose. \(\mathrm{C_{i2}\,H_{22}\,O_{1}\,+\,H_{2}O}\)\(\mathrm{C_{o}\,H_{2}\,O_{o}}\)\(\mathrm{D_{-(+)-Glucose}}\)\(\mathrm{D_{-(-)-Fructose}}\) These two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic linkage between C1 of \(\alpha\)-glucose and C2 of \(\beta\)-fructose. Since the reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar.

\(\alpha\)-D - Glucose

Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives dextrorotatory glucose and leavorotatory fructose. Since the leavorotation of fructose (-92.4 ) is more than dextrorotation of glucose (+ 52.5 ), the mixture is leavorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro (+) to laevo (-) and the product is named as **invert sugar**.
2. _Maltose_: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two \(\alpha\)-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4 of another glucose unit (II). The free aldehyde group can be produced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing properties so it is a reducing sugar.

_Lactose_: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this disaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of \(\beta\)-D-galactose and \(\beta\)-D-glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of glucose. Hence it is also a reducing sugar.

It is the most important dietary source for human beings. High content of starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It is a polymer of \(\alpha\)-glucose and consists of two components--**Amylose** and **Amylopectin**. Amylose is water soluble component which constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is a long unbranched chain with 200-1000 \(\alpha\)-D-(+)-glucose units held by C1- C4 glycosidic linkage.

Amylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80-85% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of \(\alpha\)-D-glucose

Amino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are water-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than simple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence of both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino group) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous solution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton and amino group can accept a proton, giving rise to a dipolar ion known as _zwitter ion_. This is neutral but contains both positive and negative charges.

In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as they react both with acids and bases.

Except glycine, all other naturally occurring \(\alpha\)-amino acids are optically active, since the \(\alpha\)-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist both in 'D' and 'L' forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have L-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the -NH\({}_{2}\) group on left hand side.

#### Structure of Proteins

You have already read that proteins are the polymers of \(\alpha\)-amino acids and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide linkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between -COOH group and -NH\({}_{2}\) group. The reaction between two molecules of similar or different amino acids, proceeds through the combination of the amino group of one molecule with the carboxyl group of the other. This results in the elimination of a water molecule and formation of a peptide bond -CO-NH-. The product of the reaction is called a dipeptide because it is made up of two amino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of glycine combines with the amino group of alanine we get a dipeptide. glycyclalanine.

If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a **tripeptide**. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide linkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective products are known as **tetrapeptide**, pentapeptide or hexapeptide, respectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then the products are called **polypeptides**. A polypeptide with more than hundred amino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called a protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is not very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called proteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such as insulin which contains 51 amino acids.

**Proteins** can be classified into two types on the basis of their molecular shape.

1. _Fibrous proteins_ When the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by hydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre- like structure is formed. Such proteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are keratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.

2. _Globular proteins_ This structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around to give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin and albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.

Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different levels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level being more complex than the previous one.

(1) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a protein has amino acids linked with each other in a specific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids that is said to be the primary structure of that protein. Any change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence of amino acids creates a different protein.

(2) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary structure of protein refers to the shape in which a long polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in two different types of structures viz. \(\alpha\)-helix and \(\beta\)-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due to the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide chain due to hydrogen bonding between \(\begin{array}{c}\mbox{O}\\ -\mbox{CN}-\end{array}\) and \(\begin{array}{c}\mbox{-NH}-\mbox{groups of the peptide bond.}\end{array}\)

\(\alpha\)-Helix is one of the most common ways in which a polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds by twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.14.1.

In \(\beta\)-structure all peptide chains are stretched out to nearly maximum extension and then laid side by side which are held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles the pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as \(\beta\)-pleated sheet.

(3) Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary structure of proteins represents overall folding of the polypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary structure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes viz. fibrous and globular. The main forces which stabilise the 2 and 3 structures of proteins are hydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals and electrostatic forces of attraction.

(4) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains referred to as sub-units. The spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quaternary structure.

A simplified version of nucleic acid chain is as shown below.

Information regarding the sequence of nucleotides in the chain of a nucleic acid is called its primary structure. Nucleic acids have a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick gave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 14.7). Two nucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are complementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are formed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds with guanine.

In secondary structure of RNA, helices are present which are only single stranded. Sometimes they fold back on themselves to form a double helix structure. RNA molecules are of three types and they perform different functions. They are named as messenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer RNA (t-RNA).

Har Gobind Khorana, was born in 1922. He obtained his M.Sc. degree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor Vladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana's thought and philosophy towards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in 1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor G.W. Kenner and Professor A.R.Todd. It was at Cambridge, U.K. that he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert Holley for cracking the genetic code.

## DNA Fingerprinting

It is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of the fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be altered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and information regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and cannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used

(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.

(ii) to determine maternity of an individual.

(iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA's of parents or children.

(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution.

DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important function of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the proteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA.

They are broadly classified into three groups -- monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important source of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides are held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.

**Proteins** are the polymers of about twenty different \(\alpha\)-amino acids which are linked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because they cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins perform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which contain only \(\alpha\)-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary structure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not able to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are biocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and selective in their action and chemically all enzymes are proteins.

**Viamins** are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as fat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins leads to many diseases.

Nucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base, a pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer of characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids -- DNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2-deoxyribose whereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and cytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of DNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule. DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and have the coded message for proteins to be synthesised in the cell. There are three types of RNA -- mRNA, rRNA and tRNA which actually carry out the protein synthesis in the cell.

After studying this Unit, you will be able to

* monomer, polymer and polymerisation and appreciate their importance;
* distinguish between various classes of polymers and different types of polymerisation processes;
* appreciate the formation of polymers from mono- and bifunctional monomer molecules;
* describe the preparation of some important synthetic polymers and their properties;
* appreciate the importance of polymers in daily life.

Do you think that daily life would have been easier and colourful without the discovery and varied applications of polymers? The use of polymers in the manufacture of plastic buckets, cups and saucers, children's toys, packaging bags, synthetic clothing materials, automobile tyres, gears and seals, electrical insulating materials and machine parts has completely revolutionised the daily life as well as the industrial scenario. Indeed, the polymers are the backbone of four major industries viz. plastics, elastomers, fibres and paints and varnishes.

The word 'polymer' is coined from two Greek words: _poly_ means many and _mer_ means unit or part. The term polymer is defined as very large molecules having high molecular mass (10deg-10degu). These are also referred to as **macromolecules**, which are formed by joining of repeating structural units on a large scale. The repeating structural units are derived from some simple and reactive molecules known as monomers and are linked to each other by covalent bonds. This process of formation of polymers from respective monomers is called **polymerisation**. The transformation of ethene to polythene and interaction of hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid leading to the formation of Nylon 6, 6 are examples of two different types of polymerisation reactions.

Figure 1: _“Copolymerisation has been used by nature in polypeptides which may contain as many as 20 different amino acids. Chemists are still far behind”_.

There are several ways of classification of polymers based on some special considerations. The following are some of the common classifications of polymers:

Under this type of classification, there are three sub categories.

1. _Natural polymers_

These polymers are found in plants and animals. Examples are proteins, cellulose, starch, resins and rubber.
2. _Semi-synthetic polymers_

Cellulose derivatives as cellulose acetate (rayon) and cellulose nitrate, etc. are the usual examples of this sub category.
3. _Synthetic polymers_

A variety of synthetic polymers as plastic (polythene), synthetic fibres (nylon 6,6) and synthetic rubbers (Buna - S) are examples of - mande polymers extensively used in daily life as well as in industry.

There are three different types based on the structure of the polymers.

1. _Linear polymers_

These polymers consist of long and straight chains. The examples are high density polythene, polyvinyl chloride, etc. These are represented as:

2. _Branched chain polymers_

These polymers contain linear chains having some branches, _e.g._, low density polythene. These are depicted as follows:

3. _Cross linked or Network polymers_

These are usually formed from bi-functional and tri-functional monomers and contain strong covalent bonds between various linear polymer chains, e.g. bakelite, melamine, etc. These polymers are depicted as follows:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:807]

elastomeric polymers, the polymer chains are held together by the weakest intermolecular forces. These weak binding forces permit the polymer to be stretched. A few 'crosslinks' are introduced in between the chains, which help the polymer to retract to its original position after the force is released as in vulcanised rubber. The examples are buna-S, buna-N, neoprene, etc.
2. _Fibres_:

Fibres are the thread forming solids which possess high tensile strength and high modulus. These characteristics can be attributed to the strong intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding. These strong forces also lead to close packing of chains and thus impart crystalline nature. The examples are polyamides (hylon 6, 6), polyesters (terylene), etc.
3. _Thermoplastic polymers_:

These are the linear or slightly branched long chain molecules capable of repeatedly softening on heating and hardening on cooling. These polymers possess intermolecular forces of attraction intermediate between elastomers and fibres. Some common thermoplastics are polythene, polystyrene, polyvinyl, etc.
4. _Thermosetting polymers_:

These polymers are cross linked or heavily branched molecules, which on heating undergo extensive cross linking in moulds and again become infusible. These cannot be reused. Some common examples are bakelite, urea-formaldehyde resins, etc.

The addition and condensation polymers are nowadays also referred as chain growth polymers and step growth polymers depending on the type of polymerisation mechanism they undergo during their formation.

### 15.2 Types of Polymerisation Reactions

There are two broad types of polymerisation reactions, _i.e._, the addition or chain growth polymerisation and condensation or step growth polymerisation.

In this type of polymerisation, the molecules of the same monomer or different monomers add together on a large scale to form a polymer. The monomers used are unsaturated compounds, _e.g._, alkenes, alkadienes and their derivatives. This mode of polymerisation leading to an increase in chain length or chain growth can take place through the formation of either free radicals or ionic species. However, the free radical governed addition or chain growth polymerisation is the most common mode.

1. _Free radical mechanism_

A variety of alkenes or dienes and their derivatives are polymerised in the presence of a free radical generating initiator (catalyst) like benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, etc. For example, the polymerisation of ethene to polythene consists of heating or exposing to light a mixture of ethene with a small amount of benzoyl peroxide initiator. The process starts with the addition of phenyl free radical formed by the peroxide to the ethene double bond thus generating a new and larger free radical. This step is called chain initiating step. As this radical reacts with another molecule of ethene, another bigger sized radical is formed. The repetition of this sequence with new and bigger radicals carries the reaction forward and the step is termed as chain propagating step. Ultimately, at some stage the product radical thus formed reacts with another radical to form the polymerised product. This step is called the chain terminating step. The sequence of steps may be depicted as follows:

_Chain initiation steps_

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:810]

Some important condensation polymerisation reactions characterised by their linking units are described below:

1. _Polyamides_ These polymers possessing amide linkages are important examples of synthetic fibres and are termed as nylons. The general method of preparation consists of the condensation polymerisation of diamines with dicarboxylic acids and also of amino acids and their lactams.

(a) Preparation of nylons (i)Nylon 6,6: It is prepared by the condensation polymerisation of hexamethylenediamine with adip acid under high pressure and at high temperature.

Nylon 6,6 is used in making sheets, bristles for brushes and in textile industry.

(ii)Nylon 6: It is obtained by heating caprolacatum with water at a high temperature.

Nylon 6 is used for the manufacture of tyre cords, fabrics and ropes.

2. _Polyesters_ These are the polycondensation products of dicarboxylic acids and diols. Dacron or terylene is the best known example of polyesters. It is manufactured by heating a mixture of ethylene glycol and terephthalalic acid at 420 to 460 K in the presence of zinc acetate-antimony trioxide catalyst as per the reaction given earlier. Dacron fibre (terylene) is crease resistant and is used in blending with cotton and wool fibres and also as glass reinforcing materials in safety helmets, etc.

3 Phenol - formaldehyde polymer (Bakelite and related polymers)

 Phenol - formaldehyde polymers are the oldest synthetic polymers. These are obtained by the condensation reaction of phenol with formaldehyde in the presence of either an acid or a base catalyst. The reaction starts with the initial formation of \(o\)-and/or \(p\)-hydroxymethylphenol derivatives, which further react with phenol to form compounds having rings joined to each other through -CH\({}_{2}\) groups. The initial product could be a linear product - Novolac used in paints.

## 4 Melanine - formaldehyde polymer

Melamine formaldehyde polymer is formed by the condensation polymerisation of melamine and formaldehyde.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:813]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:814]

2. _Buna - N_

You have already studied about Buna-S, in Section 15.1.3. Buna -N is obtained by the copolymerisation of 1, 3 - butadiene and acrylonitrile in the presence of a peroxide catalyst.

It is resistant to the action of petrol, lubricating oil and organic solvents. It is used in making oil seals, tank lining, etc.

Polymer properties are closely related to their molecular mass, size and structure. The growth of the polymer chain during their synthesis is dependent upon the availability of the monomers in the reaction mixture. Thus, the polymer sample contains chains of varying lengths and hence its molecular mass is always expressed as an average. The molecular mass of polymers can be determined by chemical and physical methods.

A large number of polymers are quite resistant to the environmental degradation processes and are thus responsible for the accumulation of polymeric solid waste materials. These solid wastes cause acute environmental problems and remain undegraded for quite a long time. In view of the general awareness and concern for the problems created by the polymeric solid wastes, certain new biodegradable synthetic polymers have been designed and developed. These polymers contain functional groups similar to the functional groups present in biopolymers.

Aliphatic polyesters are one of the important classes of biodegradable polymers. Some important examples are given below:

1. _Poly \(\beta\)-hydroxybutyrateate - co-\(\beta\)-hydroxy valerate (PHBV)_

It is obtained by the copolymerisation of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3 - hydroxopentanoic acid. PHBV is used in speciality packaging, orthopaedic devices and in controlled release of drugs. PHBV undergoes bacterial degradation in the environment.

C:\(\backslash\)Chemistry-12Unit:15.pmd 28.02.07

## Chapter 2 Nylon 2-nylon 6

It is an alternating polyamide copolymer of glycine (H\({}_{2}\)N-CH\({}_{2}\)-COOH) and amino caproic acid [H\({}_{2}\)N (CH)\({}_{3}\)COOH] and is biodegradable. Can you write the structure of this copolymer?

### 2.1.1.1.2.3 Polymers of Commercial Importance

Besides, the polymers already discussed, some other commercially important polymers along with their structures and uses are given below in Table 15.1.

### 2.2.4.1 Polymers

Polymers are defined as high molecular mass macromolecules, which consist of repeating structural units derived from the corresponding monomers. These polymers may be of natural or synthetic origin and are classified in a number of ways.

In the presence of an organic peroxide initiator, the alkenes and their derivatives undergo addition polymerisation or chain growth polymerisation through a free radical mechanism. Polythene, teflon, orlon, etc. are formed by addition polymerisation of an appropriate alkene or its derivative. Condensation polymerisation reactions are

This type of polymerisation proceeds through the elimination of certain simple molecules as H\({}_{2}\)O, CH\({}_{3}\)OH, etc. Formaldehyde reacts with phenol and melamine to form the corresponding condensation polymer products. The condensation polymerisation progresses through step by step and is also called as step growth polymerisation. Nylon, bakelite and dacron are some of the important examples of condensation polymers. However, a mixture of two unsaturated monomers exhibits copolymerisation and forms a co-polymer containing multiple units of each monomer. Natural rubber is a _cis_ 1, 4-polysiporene and can be made more tough by the process of vulcanisation with sulphur. Synthetic rubbers are usually obtained by copolymerisation of alkene and 1, 3 butadiene derivatives.

In view of the potential environmental hazards of synthetic polymeric wastes, certain biodegradable polymers such as PHBV and Nylon-2- Nylon-6 are developed as alternatives.

After studying this Unit you will be able to visualise the importance of Chemistry in daily life; explain the term 'chemotherapy'; describe the basis of classification of drugs; explain drug-target interaction of enzymes and receptors; explain how various types of drugs function in the body; know about artificial sweetening agents and food preservatives; discuss the chemistry of cleansing agents.

By now, you have learnt the basic principles of chemistry and also realised that it influences every sphere of human life. The principles of chemistry have been used for the benefit of mankind. Think of cleanliness -- the materials like soaps, detergents, household bleaches, tooth pastes, etc. will come to your mind. Look towards the beautiful clothes -- immediately chemicals of the synthetic fibres used for making clothes and chemicals giving colours to them will come to your mind. Food materials -- again a number of chemicals about which you have learnt in the previous Unit will appear in your mind. Of course, sickness and diseases remind us of medicines -- again chemicals. Explosives, fuels, rocket propellents, building and electronic materials, etc., are all chemicals. Chemistry has influenced our life so much that we do not even realise that we come across chemicals at every moment; that we ourselves are beautiful chemical reactions and all our activities are controlled by chemicals. In this Unit, we shall learn the application of Chemistry in three important and interesting areas, namely - medicines, food materials and cleansing agents.

**Drugs and their**

_(Classification)_

**Drugs** are chemicals of low molecular masses (~100 - 500u). These interact with macromolecular targets and produce a biological response. When the biological response is therapeutic and useful, these chemicals are called **medicines** and are used in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. If taken in doses higher than those recommended, most of the drugs used as medicines are potential poisons. Use of chemicals for therapeutic effect is called **chemotherapy**,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:820]

Substrates bind to the active site of the enzyme through a variety of interactions such as ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interaction or dipole-dipole interaction (Fig. 16.1).

**(ii)** The second function of an enzyme is to provide functional groups that will attack the substrate and carry out chemical reaction.

**(b)** _Drug-enzyme interaction_

Drugs inhibit any of the above mentioned activities of enzymes. These can block the binding site of the enzyme and prevent the binding of substrate, or can inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such drugs are called enzyme inhibitors.

Drugs inhibit the attachment of substrate on active site of enzymes in two different ways;

**(i)** Drugs compete with the natural substrate for their attachment on the active sites of enzymes. Such drugs are called competitive inhibitors (Fig. 16.2).

**(ii)** Some drugs do not bind to the enzyme's active site. These bind to a different site of enzyme which is called allosteric site. This binding of inhibitor at allosteric site (Fig. 16.3) changes the shape of the active site in such a way that substrate cannot recognise it.

If the bond formed between an enzyme and an inhibitor is a strong covalent bond and

**(iii)** Chemistry in Everyday Life

Figure 16.3: Non-competitive inhibitor changes the active site of enzyme after binding at allosteric site.

Figure 16.2: Drug and substrate competing for active site

cannot be broken easily, then the enzyme is blocked permanently. The body then degrades the enzyme-inhibitor complex and synthesises the new enzyme.

#### Receptors

Receptors are proteins that are crucial to body's communication process. Majority of these are embedded in cell membranes (Fig. 16.4). Receptor proteins are embedded in the cell membrane in such a way that their small part possessing active site projects out of the surface of the membrane and opens on the outside region of the cell membrane (Fig. 16.4).

In the body, message between two neurons and that between neurons to muscles is communicated through certain chemicals. These chemicals, known as **chemical messengers** are received at the binding sites of receptor proteins. To accommodate a messenger, shape of the receptor site changes. This brings about the transfer of message into the cell. Thus, chemical messenger gives message to the cell without entering the cell (Fig. 16.5).

There are a large number of different receptors in the body that interact with different chemical messengers. These receptors show selectivity for one chemical messenger over the other because their binding sites have different shape, structure and amino acid composition.

Figure 16.5: (a) Receptor receiving chemical messenger (b) Shape of the receptor changed after attachment of messenger (c) Receptor regains structure after removal of chemical messenger.

Figure 16.4: Receptor protein embedded in the cell membrane, the active site of the receptor opens on the outside region of the cell.

Drugs that bind to the receptor site and inhibit its natural function are called antagonists. These are useful when blocking of message is required. There are other types of drugs that mimic the natural messenger by switching on the receptor, these are called agonists. These are useful when there is lack of natural chemical messenger.

### Therapeutic Action of Different Classes of Drugs

In this Section, we shall discuss the therapeutic action of a few important classes of drugs.

**16.3.1 Antacids**: Over production of acid in the stomach causes irritation and pain. In severe cases, ulcers are developed in the stomach. Until 1970, only treatment for acidity was administration of antacids, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate or a mixture of aluminium and magnesium hydroxide. However, excessive hydrogencarbonate can make the stomach alkaline and trigger the production of even more acid. Metal hydroxides are better alternatives because of being insoluble, these do not increase the pH above neutrality. These treatments control only symptoms, and not the cause. Therefore, with these metal salts, the patients cannot be treated easily. In advanced stages, ulcers become life threatening and its only treatment is removal of the affected part of the stomach.
**16.3.2**: A major breakthrough in the treatment of hyperacidity came through the discovery according to which a chemical, histamine, stimulates the secretion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The drug cimetidine (Tegamet), was designed to prevent the interaction of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach wall. This resulted in release of lesser amount of acid. The importance of the drug was so much that it remained the largest selling drug in the world until another drug, ranitidine (Zantac), was discovered.

Histamine is a potent vasodilator. It has various functions. It contracts the smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut and relaxes other muscles, such as those in the walls of fine blood vessels. Histamine is also responsible for the nasal congestion associated with common cold and allergic response to pollen.

Synthetic drugs, brompheniramine (Dimetapp) and terfenadine (Seldane), act as antihistamines. They interfere with the natural action of histamine by competing with histamine for binding sites of receptor where histamine exerts its effect.

Now the question that arises is, "Why do above mentioned antihistamines not affect the secretion of acid in stomach?" The reason is that antiallergic and antacid drugs work on different receptors.

#### 16.3.3 (a) Tranquilizers

Tranquilizers and analogies are neurologically active drugs. These affect the message transfer mechanism from nerve to receptor.

Tranquilizers are a class of chemical compounds used for the treatment of stress, and mild or even severe mental diseases. These relieve anxiety, stress, irritability or excitement by inducing a sense of well-being. They form an essential component of sleeping pills. There are various types of tranquilizers. They function by different mechanisms. For example, noradrenaline is one of the neurotransmitters that plays a role in mood changes. If the level of noradrenaline is low for some reason, then the signal-sending activity becomes low, and the person suffers from depression. In such situations, antidepressant drugs are required. These drugs inhibit the enzymes which catalyse the degradation of noradrenaline. If the enzyme is inhibited, this important neurotransmitter is slowly metabolised and can activate its receptor for longer periods of time, thus counteracting the effect of depression. Ipronazid and phenelazine are two such drugs.

Some tranquilizers namely, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate, are relatively mild tranquilizers suitable for relieving tension. Equanil is used in controlling depression and hypertension.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:825]

#### 16.3.4 Antimicrobials

Diseases in human beings and animals may be caused by a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, virus, fungi and other pathogens. An antimicrobial tends to destroy/prevent development or inhibit the pathogenic action of microbes such as bacteria (antibacterial drugs), fungi (antifungal agents), virus (antiviral agents), or other parasites (antiparasitic drugs) selectively. Antibiotics, antiseptics and disinfectants are antimicrobial drugs.

#### (a) Antibiotics

Antibiotics are used as drugs to treat infections because of their low toxicity for humans and animals. Initially antibiotics were classified as chemical substances produced by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and molds) that inhibit the growth or even destroy microorganisms. The development of synthetic methods has helped in synthesising some of the compounds that were originally discovered as products of microorganisms. Also, some purely synthetic compounds have antibacterial activity, and therefore, definition of antibiotic has been modified. An antibiotic now refers to a substance produced wholly or partly by chemical synthesis, which in low concentrations inhibits the growth or destroys microorganisms by intervening in their metabolic processes.

The search for chemicals that would adversely affect invading bacteria but not the host began in the nineteenth century. Paul Ehrlich, a German bacteriologist, conceived this idea. He investigated arsenic based structures in order to produce less toxic substances for the treatment of syphilis. He developed the medicine, arsphenamine, known as salvarsan. Paul Ehrlich got Nobel prize for Medicine in 1908 for this discovery. It was the first effective treatment discovered for syphilis. Although salvarsan is toxic to human beings, its effect on the bacteria, approchete, which causes syphilis is much greater than on human beings. At the same time, Ehrlich was working on azodyes also. He noted that there is similarity in structures of salvarsan andazodyes. The -As = As- linkage present in arsphenamine resembles the -N = N - linkage present in azodyes in the sense that arsenic atom is present in place of nitrogen. He also noted tissues getting coloured by dyes selectively. Therefore, Ehrlich began to search for the compounds which resemble in structure to azodyes and selectively bind to bacteria. In 1932, he succeeded in preparing the first effective antibacterial agent, prontosil, which resembles in structure to the compound, salvarsan. Soon it was discovered that in the body prontsol is converted to a compound called **sulphanilamide**, which is the real active compound. Thus the sulpha drugs were discovered. A large range of sulphonamide analogues was synthesised. One of the most effective is sulphaphydidine.

Despite the success of sulfonamides, the real revolution in antibacterial therapy began with the discovery of Alexander Fleming in 1929, of the antibacterial properties of a _Penicillium_ fungus. Isolation and purification of active compound to accumulate sufficient material for clinical trials took thirteen years.

Antibiotics have either cidal (killing) effect or a static (inhibitory) effect on microbes. A few examples of the two types of antibiotics are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
**Bactericidal** & **Bacteriostatic** \\ Penicillin & Erythromycin \\ Aminoglycos & Tetracycline \\ Ofloxacin & Chloramphenicol \\ \end{tabular}

The range of bacteria or other microorganisms that are affected by a certain antibiotic is expressed as its spectrum of action. Antibiotics which kill or inhibit a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are said to be broad spectrum antibiotics. Those effective mainly against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria are **narrow spectrum antibiotics**. If effective against a single organism or disease, they are referred to as **limited spectrum antibiotics**. Penicillin G has a narrow spectrum. Ampicillin and Amoxycillin are synthetic modifications of penicillins. These have broad spectrum. It is absolutely essential to test the patients for sensitivity (allergy) to penicillin before it is administered. In India, penicillin is manufactured at the Hindustan Antibiotics in Pimpri and in private sector industry.

_Chloramphenicol_, isolated in 1947, is a broad spectrum antibiotic. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hence can be given orally in case of typhoid, dysentery, acute fever, certain form of urinary infections, meningitis and pneumonia. _Vancomycin_ and _ofloxacin_ are the other important broad spectrum antibiotics. The antibiotic _dystidaezitne_ is supposed to be toxic towards certain strains of cancer cells.

10.4 Chemicals in Food

Chemicals are added to food for (i) their preservation, (ii) enhancing their appeal, and (iii) adding nutritive value in them. Main categories of food additives are as follows:

1. Food colours
2. Flavours and sweeteners
3. Fat emulsifiers and stabilising agents
4. Flour improvers - antistaling agents and bleaches
5. Antioxidants
6. Preservatives
7. Nutritional supplements such as minerals, vitamins and amino acids.

Except for chemicals of category (vii), none of the above additives have nutritive value. These are added either to increase the shelf life of stored food or for cosmetic purposes. In this Section we will discuss only sweeteners and food preservatives.

16.4.1 Artificial

Sweetenings

Natural sweeteners, e.g., sucrose add to calorie intake and therefore many people prefer to use artificial sweeteners. Ortho-sulphobenzimide, also called saccharin, is the first popular artificial sweetening agent. It has been used as a sweetening agent ever since it was discovered in 1879. It is about 550 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is excreted from the body in urine unchanged. It appears to be entirely inert and harmless when taken. Its use is of great value to diabetic persons and people who need to control intake of calories. Some other commonly marketed artificial sweeteners are given in Table 16.1.

**Aspartame** is the most successful and widely used artificial sweetener. It is roughly 100 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is methyl ester of dipeptide formed from aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Use of aspartame is limited to cold foods and soft drinks because it is unstable at cooking temperature.

**Alitame** is high potency sweetener, although it is more stable than aspartame, the control of sweetness of food is difficult while using it.

**Suerclose** is trichloro derivative of sucrose. Its appearance and taste are like sugar. It is stable at cooking temperature. It does not provide calories.

**Food**:
**Food**:
**preservatives**:
**The most commonly used preservatives include table salt, sugar, vegetable oils and sodium benzoate, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)COONa. Sodium benzoate is used in limited quantities and is metabolised in the body. Salts of sorbic acid and propanoic acid are also used as preservatives.

**In**:
**Why do we require artificial sweetening agents?**

**In this Section, we will learn about detergents. Two types of detergents are used as cleansing agents. These are soaps and synthetic detergents. These improve cleansing properties of water. These help in removal of fats which bind other materials to the fabric or skin.

**Soaps**:

**Soaps are the detergents used since long. Soaps used for cleaning purpose are sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids, e.g., stearic, oleic and palmitic acids. Soaps containing sodium salts are formed by heating fat (_i.e._, glyceryl ester of fatty acid) with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. This reaction is known as saponification.**In this reaction, esters of fatty acids are hydrolys and the soap obtained remains in colloidal form. It is precipitated from the solution by adding sodium chloride. The solution left after removing the soap contains glycerol, which can be recovered by fractional distillation. Only sodium and potassium soaps are soluble in water and are used for cleaning purposes. Generally potassium soaps are soft to the skin than sodium soaps. These can be prepared by using potassium hydroxide solution in place of sodium hydroxide.

_Types of soaps_

Basically all soaps are made by boiling fats or oils with suitable soluble hydroxide. Variations are made by using different raw materials.

_Tollet soaps_ are prepared by using better grades of fats and oils and care is taken to remove excess alkali. Colour and perfumes are added to make these more attractive.

_Soaps that float_ in water are made by beating tiny air bubbles before their hardening. _Transparent soaps_ are made by dissolving the soap in ethanol and then evaporating the excess solvent.

In _medicated soaps_, substances of medicinal value are added. In some soaps, deodorants are added. _Shaving soaps_ contain glycerol to prevent rapid drying. A gum called, rosin is added while making them. It forms sodium rosinate which lathers well. _Laundry soaps_ contain fillers like sodium rosinate, sodium silicate, borax and sodium carbonate.

Soap chips are made by running a thin sheet of melted soap onto a cool cylinder and scraping off the soaps in small broken pieces. _Soap granules_ are dried miniature soap bubbles. _Soap powders_ and _scouring soaps_ contain some soap, a scouring agent (abrasive) such as powdered pumice or finely divided sand, and builders like sodium carbonate and trisodium phosphate. Builders make the soaps act more rapidly. The cleansing action of soap has been discussed in Unit 5.

_Why do soaps not work in hard water?_

Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions. These ions form insoluble calcium and magnesium soaps respectively when sodium or potassium soaps are dissolved in hard water.

\(\text{2C}_{1j}\text{H}_{35}\text{COONa}\)\(+\)\(\text{CaCl}_{2}\)\(+\)\(\text{(C}_{1r}\text{H}_{35}\text{COON)}_{2}\text{Ca}\)

Insoluble calcium

stearate (Soap)

These insoluble soaps separate as scum in water and are useless as cleansing agent. In fact these are hinderance to good washing, because the precipitate adheres onto the fibre of the cloth as gummy mass. Hair washed with hard water looks dull because of this sticky precipitate. Dye does not absorb evenly on cloth washed with soap using hard water, because of this gummy mass.

**16.5.2 Synthetic**:

\(\text{{\bf 16.5.2}}\) **Synthetic detergents are cleansing agents which have all the properties of soaps, but which actually do not contain any soap. These can be used both in soft and hard water as they give foam even in hard water. Some of the detergents give foam even in ice cold water.**Synthetic detergents are mainly classified into three categories: (i) Anionic detergents (ii) Cationic detergents and (iii) Non-ionic detergents (ii) _Anionic Detergents:_ Anionic detergents are sodium salts of sulphonated long chain alcohols or hydrocarbons. Alkyl hydrogensulphates formed by treating long chain alcohols with concentrated sulphuric acid are neutralised with alkali to form anionic detergents. Similarly alkyl benzene sulphonates are obtained by neutralising alkyl benzene sulphononic acids with alkali.

In anionic detergents, the anionic part of the molecule is involved in the cleansing action. Sodium salts of alkylbenzenesulfphonates are an important class of anionic detergents.

They are mostly used for household work. Anionic detergents are also used in toothpastes.

_(ii) Cationic Detergents_: Cationic detergents are quarternary ammonium salts of amines with acetates, chlorides or bromides as anions. Cationic part possess a long hydrocarbon chain and a positive charge on nitrogen atom. Hence, these are called cationic detergents.

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is a popular cationic detergent and is used in hair conditioners.

Cationic detergents have germicidal properties and are expensive, therefore, these are of limited use.

_(iii) Non-ionic Detergents:_ Non-ionic detergents do not contain any ion in their constitution. One such detergent is formed when stearic acid reacts with polyethyleneglycol.

three main categories, namely: anionic, cationic and non-ionic, and each category has its specific uses. Detergents with straight chain of hydrocarbons are preferred over branched chain as the latter are non-biodegradable and consequently cause environmental pollution.
