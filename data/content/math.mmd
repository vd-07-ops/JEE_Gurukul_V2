In these days of conflict between ancient and modern studies; there must surely be something to be said for a study which did not begin with Pythagoras and will not end with Einstein; but is the oldest and the youngest. -- GH. HARDY

### 1 Introduction

The concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets.

The theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on "problems on trigonometric series". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets.

### 2 Sets and their Representations

In everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections:

1. Odd natural numbers less than 10, i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
2. The rivers of India
3. The vowels in the English alphabet, namely, _a, e, i, o, u_
4. Various kinds of triangles
5. Prime factors of 210, namely, 2,3,5 and 7
6. The solution of the equation: \(x^{2}-5x+6=0\), viz, 2 and 3. We note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in the sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this colleciton.

We give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz.

**N :** the set of all natural numbers
**Z :** the set of all integers
**Q :** the set of all rational numbers
**R :** the set of real numbers
**Z' :** the set of positive integers
**Q' :** the set of positive rational numbers, and

**R' :** the set of positive real numbers.

The symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text.

Again the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection.

We shall say that _a set is a well-defined collection of objects_.

The following points may be noted:

1. Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous terms.
2. Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.
3. The elements of a set are represented by small letters _a, b, c, x, y, z_, etc.

If \(a\) is an element of a set A, we say that "_a_ belongs to A" the Greek symbol \(\in\) (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase '_belongs to_'. Thus, we write _a_\(\in\) A. If '_b_' is not an element of a set A, we write _b_\(\not\in\) A and read "_b_ does not belong to A".

Thus, in the set V of vowels in the English alphabet, _a_\(\in\) V but _b_\(\not\in\) V. In the set P of prime factors of \(30,3\in\) P but \(15\not\in\) P.

There are two methods of representing a set :

1. Roster or tabular form
2. Set-builder form.
2. In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces \(\{\ \ \}\). For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as \(\{2,4,6\}\). Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below : 1. The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is \(\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\}\).

NoteIn roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. Thus, the above set can also be represented as {1, 3, 7, 21, 2, 6, 14, 42}.

(b) The set of all vowels in the English alphabet is {_a, e, i, o, u_}.

(c) The set of odd natural numbers is represented by {1, 3, 5, \(\ldots\)}. The dots tell us that the list of odd numbers continue indefinitely.

NoteIt may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is { S, C, H, O, L} or {H, O, L, C, S}. Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance.

(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set {_a, e, i, o, u_}, all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possess this property. Denoting this set by V, we write

V = {_x_ : \(x\) is a vowel in English alphabet}

It may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol \(x\) (any other symbol like the letters \(y\),_z_, etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon " : ". After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set V is read as "the set of all_x_ such that \(x\) is a vowel of the English alphabet". In this description the braces stand for "the set of all", the colon stands for "such that". For example, the set

A = {_x_ : \(x\) is a natural number and 3_<_x_ < 10} is read as "the set of all \(x\) such that \(x\) is a natural number and \(x\) lies between 3 and 10." Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set A.

If we denote the sets described in (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_) above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B,C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows:

A= {_x_ : \(x\) is a natural number which divides 42}

B= {_y_ : \(y\) is a vowel in the English alphabet}

C= {_z_ : \(z\) is an odd natural number}

Example 1Write the solution set of the equation _x_\({}^{2}+x-2=0\) in roster form.

SolutionThe given equation can be written as

\[(x-1)\ \ (x+2)=0,\,\text{i. e.,}\ \ \ x=1,-2\]

Therefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as \(\{1,-2\}\).

Example 2Write the set {_x_ : \(x\) is a positive integer and _x_\({}^{2}<40\)} in the roster form.

**Solution** The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the given set in the roster form is \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\).

**Example 3** Write the set \(\mathrm{A}=\{1,4,9,16,25,\ldots\}\)in set-builder form.

**Solution** We may write the set \(\mathrm{A}\) as

\[\mathrm{A}=\{x:x\text{ is the square of a natural number}\}\]

Alternatively, we can write

\[\mathrm{A}=\{x:x=n^{2}\text{, where }n\in\mathbf{N}\}\]

**Example 4** Write the set \(\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{4},\frac{4}{5},\frac{5}{6},\frac{6}{7}\}\)in the set-builder form.

**Solution** We see that each member in the given set has the numerator one less than the denominator. Also, the numerator begin from 1 and do not exceed 6. Hence, in the set-builder form the given set is

\[\dot{\left\{x:x=\frac{n}{n+1}\text{, where }n\text{ is a natural number and }1\leq n\leq 6\right\}}\]

**Example 5** Match each of the set on the left described in the roster form with the same set on the right described in the set-builder form:

1. \(\{\mathrm{P,R,I,N,C,A,L}\}\)
2. \(\{x:x\text{ is a positive integer and is a divisor of }18\}\)
3. \(\{0\}\)
4. \(\{x:x\text{ is an integer and }x^{2}-9=0\}\)
5. \(\{1,2,3,6,9,18\}\)
6. \(\{x:x\text{ is an integer and }x+1=1\}\)
7. \(\{3,-3\}\)
8. \(\{x:x\text{ is a letter of the word PRINCIPAL}\}\)

**Solution** Since in (d), there are 9 letters in the word PRINCIPAL and two letters P and I are repeated, so (i) matches (d). Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as \(x+1=1\) implies \(x=0\). Also, 1, 2,3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally, \(x^{2}-9=0\) implies \(x=3\), \(-3\) and so (iv) matches (b).

### The Empty Set

Consider the set

A = { \(x:x\) is a student of Class XI presently studying in a school }

We can go to the school and count the number of students presently studying in Class XI in the school. Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements.

We now write another set B as follows:\(\mathrm{B}=\{\ x:x\text{ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }\}\)

We observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set \(\mathrm{B}\) contains no element at all.

**Definition 1**: A set which does not contain any element is called the _empty set_ or the _null set_ or the _void set_.

According to this definition, \(\mathrm{B}\) is an empty set while \(\mathrm{A}\) is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol \(\phi\) or \(\{\ \ \}\).

We give below a few examples of empty sets.

1. Let \(\mathrm{A}=\{x:1<x<2\), \(x\text{ is a natural number}\}\). Then \(\mathrm{A}\) is the empty set, because there is no natural number between 1 and 2.
2. \(\mathrm{B}=\{x:x^{2}-2=0\text{ and }x\text{ is rational number}\}\). Then \(\mathrm{B}\) is the empty set because the equation \(x^{2}-2=0\) is not satisfied by any rational value of \(x\).
3. \(\mathrm{C}=\{x:x\text{ is an even prime number greater than }2\}\). Then \(\mathrm{C}\) is the empty set, because 2 is the only even prime number.
4. \(\mathrm{D}=\{\ x:x^{2}=4,\text{ is odd }\}\). Then \(\mathrm{D}\) is the empty set, because the equation \(x^{2}\)= 4 is not satisfied by any odd value of \(x\).

### Finite and Infinite Sets

Let \(\mathrm{A}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\), \(\mathrm{B}=\{a,b,c,d,e,g\}\), and \(\mathrm{C}=\{\ \mathrm{men\ living\ presently\ in different\ parts\ of\ the\ world\}\}\)

We observe that \(\mathrm{A}\) contains \(5\) elements and \(\mathrm{B}\) contains \(6\) elements. How many elements does \(\mathrm{C}\) contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in \(\mathrm{C}\), but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set \(\mathrm{S}\), we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by \(n\) (\(\mathrm{S}\)). If \(n\) (\(\mathrm{S}\)) is a natural number, then \(\mathrm{S}\) is _non-empty finite_ set.

Consider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite number of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) given above are finite sets and \(n(\mathrm{A})=5\), \(n(\mathrm{B})=6\) and \(n(\mathrm{C})=\mathrm{some\ finite\ number}\).

**Definition 2**: A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called _finite_ otherwise, the set is called _infinite_.

Consider some examples :

1. Let \(\mathrm{W}\) be the set of the days of the week. Then \(\mathrm{W}\) is finite.
2. Let \(\mathrm{S}\) be the set of solutions of the equation \(x^{2}-16=0\). Then \(\mathrm{S}\) is finite.
3. Let \(\mathrm{G}\) be the set of points on a line. Then \(\mathrm{G}\) is infinite.

When we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces \(\{\ \ \}\). It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces \(\{\ \ \}\) because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent some infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots.

For example, \(\{1,2,3\ldots\}\) is the set of natural numbers, \(\{1,3,5,7,\ldots\}\) is the set of odd natural numbers, \(\{\ldots,\neg 3,-2,-1,0,1,2\,3,\ldots\}\) is the set of integers. All these sets are infinite.

NoteAll infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern.

**Example 6**: State which of the following sets are finite or infinite :

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & (i) & \(\{x:x\in\) N and \((x-1)\) (\(x-2)=0\}\) \\  & (ii) & \(\{x:x\in\) N and \(x^{2}=4\}\) \\  & (iii) & \(\{x:x\in\) N and \(2x-1=0\}\) \\  & (iv) & \(\{x:x\in\) N and \(x\) is prime\} \\  & (v) & \(\{x:x\in\) N and \(x\) is odd\} \\ Solution & (i) & Given set = \(\{1,2\}\). Hence, it is finite. \\  & (ii) & Given set = \(\{2\}\). Hence, it is finite. \\  & (iii) & Given set = \(\phi\). Hence, it is finite. \\  & (iv) & The given set is the set of all prime numbers and since set of prime numbers is infinite. Hence the given set is infinite \\  & (v) & Since there are infinite number of odd numbers, hence, the given set is infinite. \\ \end{tabular}

### Equal Sets

Given two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements.

Two sets A and B are said to be _equal_ if they have exactly the same elements and we write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be _unequal_ and we write A \(\neq\) B.

We consider the following examples :

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & (i) & Let A = \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(\qquad\) B = \(\{3,1,4,2\}\). Then A = B. \\  & (ii) & Let A be the set of prime numbers less than 6 and P the set of prime factors of 30. Then A and P are equal, since 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime factors of 30 and also these are less than 6. \\ \end{tabular}

NoteA set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. For example, the sets A = \(\{1,2,3\}\) and B = \(\{2,2,1,3,3\}\) are equal, since each 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

4. The set of animals living on the earth 5. The set of circles passing through the origin (0,0)

**4.** In the following, state whether A = B or not:

1. A = { _a, b, c, d_ }  B = { _d, c, b, a_ }
2. A = { _4, 8, 12, 16_ }  B = { _8, 4, 16, 18_}
3. A = { _2, 4, 6, 8, 10_}  B = { _x: x_ is positive even integer and \(x\) \(\leq\) 10}
4. A = { _x: x_ is a multiple of 10_},  B = { _10, 15, 20, 25, 30,..._ }

**5.** Are the following pair of sets equal? Give reasons.

1. A = {2, 3},  B = { _x: x_ is solution of \(x^{2}+5x+6=0\)}
2. A = { _x: x_ is a letter in the word FOLLOW}

B = { _y: y_ is a letter in the word WOLF}

**6.** From the sets given below, select equal sets :

A = { _2, 4, 8, 12_},  B = { _1, 2, 3, 4_},  C = { _4, 8, 12, 14_},  D = { _3, 1, 4, 2_}

E = {-1, 1},  F = { _0, a_},  G = {1, -1},  H = { _0, 1_}

### Subsets

Consider the sets : X = set of all students in your school, Y = set of all students in your class.

We note that every element of Y is also an element of X; we say that Y is a subset of X. The fact that Y is subset of X is expressed in symbols as Y \(\subset\) X. The symbol \(\subset\) stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'.

**Definition 4** A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B.

In other words, A \(\subset\) B if whenever \(a\in\) A, then \(a\in\) B. It is often convenient to use the symbol "\(\Rightarrow\)" which means _implies_. Using this symbol, we can write the definiton of _subset_ as follows:

A \(\subset\) B if \(a\in\) A \(\Rightarrow\)\(a\in\) B

We read the above statement as "_A is a subset of B if a is an element of A implies that a is also an element of B_". If A is not a subset of B, we write A \(\subset\) B.

We may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B \(\subset\) A. In this case, A and B are the same sets so that we have A \(\subset\) B and B \(\subset\) A \(\Leftrightarrow\) A = B, where "\(\Leftrightarrow\)" is a symbol for two way implications, and is usually read as _if and only if_ (briefly written as "iff").

It follows from the above definition that every set _A is a subset of itself_, i.e., A \(\subset\) A. Since the empty set \(\phi\) has no elements, we agree to say that \(\phi\) _is a subset of every set_. We now consider some examples :

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

which is read "\(\mathbf{Q}\) is the set of all numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) equals the quotient \(\dfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q\) is not zero". Members of \(\mathbf{Q}\) include \(-5\) (which can be expressed as \(-\dfrac{5}{1}\)), \(\dfrac{5}{7}\), \(3\dfrac{1}{2}\) (which can be expressed as \(\dfrac{7}{2}\)) and \(-\dfrac{11}{3}\).

The set of irrational numbers, denoted by \(\mathbf{T}\), is composed of all other real numbers. Thus \(\mathbf{T}=\{x:\ x\in\mathbf{R}\ \text{and}\ x\not\in\mathbf{Q}\}\), i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of \(\mathbf{T}\) include \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\sqrt{5}\) and \(\pi\).

Some of the obvious relations among these subsets are:

\(\mathbf{N}\ \subset\ \mathbf{Z}\subset\mathbf{Q}\), \(\mathbf{Q}\subset\mathbf{R}\), \(\mathbf{T}\subset\mathbf{R}\), \(\mathbf{N}\subset\mathbf{T}\).

**1.6.2**: _Intervals as subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\) Let \(a\), \(b\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(a<b\). Then the set of real numbers \(\{\ y:a<y<b\}\) is called an open interval and is denoted by \((a,b)\). All the points between \(a\) and \(b\) belong to the open interval \((a,b)\) but \(a\), \(b\) themselves do not belong to this interval._

The interval which contains the end points also is called _closed interval_ and is denoted by \([\ a,\ b\ ]\). Thus

\([\ a,\ b\ ]=\{x:a\leq x\leq b\}\)

We can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e.,

\([\ a,\ b\ ]=\{x:a\leq x<b\}\) is an open interval from \(a\) to \(b\), including \(a\) but excluding \(b\).

\((\ a,\ b\ ]=\{x:a<x\leq b\ \}\) is an open interval from \(a\) to \(b\) including \(b\) but excluding \(a\).

These notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if A = (\(-3,5\)) and B = [\(-7\), \(9\)], then A \(\subset\) B. The set \([\ 0\), \(\infty)\) defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set \((\ -\infty\), \(0\ )\) defines the set of negative real numbers. The set \((\ -\infty\,\infty\ )\) describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\).

On real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\), are shown in the Fig 1.1.

Here, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points.

For example, the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\ \text{,}\ -5<x\leq 7\}\), written in set-builder form, can be written in the form of interval as (\(-5\), \(7\)] and the interval [\(-3\), \(5\)] can be written in set-builder form as \(\{x:-3\leq x<5\}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

Write the following as intervals :

(i) \(\{x:x\in\text{R},-4<x\leq 6\}\) (ii) \(\{x:x\in\text{R},-12<x<-10\}\)

(iii) \(\{x:x\in\text{R},\,0\leq x<7\}\) (iv) \(\{x:x\in\text{R},\,3\leq x\leq 4\}\)

Write the following intervals in set-builder form :

(i) (- 3, 0) (ii) [6, 12] (iii) (6, 12] (iv) [-23, 5)

What universal set(s) would you propose for each of the following :

(i) The set of right triangles. (ii) The set of isosceles triangles.

Given the sets A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4, 6} and C = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}, which of the following may be considered as universal set (s) for all the three sets A, B and C

(i) \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)

(ii) \(\phi\)

(iii) \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}\)

(iv) \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}\)

### Venn Diagrams

Most of the relationships between sets can be represented by means of diagrams which are known as _Venn diagrams_. Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles.

In Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3)

**Illustration 1** In Fig 1.2, U = {1,2,3,...,10} is the universal set of which

A = {2,4,6,8,10} is a subset.

**Illustration 2** In Fig 1.3, U = {1,2,3,..., 10} is the universal set of which

A = {2,4,6,8,10} and B = {4, 6} are subsets, and also B \(\subset\) A.

The reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets.

### Operations on Sets

In earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65.

Similarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set.

#### 1.9.1 Union of sets

Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol '\(\cup\)' is used to denote the _union_. _Symbolically, we write_ A \(\cup\) B _and usually read as 'A union B'_.

**Example 12**: Let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8} and B = { 6, 8, 10, 12}. Find A \(\cup\) B.

**Solution**: We have A \(\cup\) B = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}

Note that the common elements 6 and 8 have been taken only once while writing A \(\cup\) B.

**Example 13**: Let A = { _a, e, i, o, u_} and B = { _a, i, u_}. Show that A \(\cup\) B = A
**Solution**: We have, A \(\cup\) B = { _a, e, i, o, u_} = A_

This example illustrates that union of sets A and its subset B is the set A itself, i.e., if B \(\subset\) A, then A \(\cup\) B = A.

**Example 14**: Let X = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar}, be the set of students of Class XI, who are in school hockey team. Let Y = {Geeta, David, Ashok}, be the set of students from Class XI who are in the school football team. Find X \(\cup\) Y and interpret the set.

**Solution**: We have, X \(\cup\) Y = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar, David, Ashok}. This is the set of students from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both.

Thus, we can define the union of two sets as follows:

**Definition 5**: The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those elements which are either in A or in B (including those which are in both). In symbols, we write. A \(\cup\) B = { _x : x \(\in\)_A or x \(\in\)B }

The union of two sets can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4.

The shaded portion in Fig 1.4 represents A \(\cup\) B.

**Some Properties of the Operation of Union**

1. [label=()]
2. A \(\cup\) B = B \(\cup\) A (Commutative law)
3. ( A \(\cup\) B ) \(\cup\) C = A \(\cup\) ( B \(\cup\) C) (Associative law )
4. A \(\cup\) \(\phi\) = A (Law of identity element, \(\phi\) is the identity of \(\cup\))* \(\mathrm{A}\cup\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}\) (Idempotent law)
* \(\mathrm{U}\cup\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{U}\) (Law of \(\mathrm{U}\))

#### Intersection of sets

The intersection of sets \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) is the set of all elements which are common to both \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). The symbol '\(\cap\)' is used to denote the _intersection_. The intersection of two sets \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) is the set of all those elements which belong to both \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). Symbolically, we write \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\{x:\ x\in\mathrm{A}\text{ and }x\in\mathrm{B}\}\).

**Example 15**: Consider the sets \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) of Example 12. Find \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}\).

**Solution** We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). Hence \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\{\ 6,\ 8\ \}\).

**Example 16**: Consider the sets \(\mathrm{X}\) and \(\mathrm{Y}\) of Example 14. Find \(\mathrm{X}\cap\mathrm{Y}\).

**Solution** We see that element 'Geeta' is the only element common to both. Hence, \(\mathrm{X}\cap\mathrm{Y}=\{\text{Geeta}\}\).

**Example 17**: Let \(\mathrm{A}=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,6,\,7,\,8,\,9,\,10\}\) and \(\mathrm{B}=\{\ 2,\,3,\,5,\,7\}\). Find \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}\) and hence show that \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{B}\).

**Solution** We have \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\{\ 2,\,3,\,5,\,7\}=\mathrm{B}\), We note that \(\mathrm{B}\subset\mathrm{A}\) and that \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{B}\).

**Definition 6**: The intersection of two sets \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) is the set of all those elements which belong to both \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). Symbolically, we write

\(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\{x:x\in\mathrm{A}\text{ and }x\in\mathrm{B}\}\)

The shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the intersection of \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\).

If \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are two sets such that \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\phi\), then \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are called _disjoint sets_.

For example, let \(\mathrm{A}=\{2,4,\,6,\,8\ \}\) and \(\mathrm{B}=\{\ 1,\,3,\,5,\,7\ \}\). Then \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are disjoint sets, because there are no elements which are common to \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). The disjoint sets can be represented by means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6

In the above diagram, \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are disjoint sets.

**Some Properties of Operation of Intersection**

* \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{B}\cap\mathrm{A}\) (Commutative law).
* \((\mathrm{A}\,\cap\mathrm{B}\,)\cap\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{A}\cap(\mathrm{B}\cap \mathrm{C}\,)\) (Associative law).
* \(\phi\cap\mathrm{A}=\phi\), \(\mathrm{U}\cap\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}\) (Law of \(\phi\) and \(\mathrm{U}\)).
* \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}\) (Idempotent law)

### Complement of a Set

Let U be the universal set which consists of all prime numbers and A be the subset of U which consists of all those prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Thus, \(A=\{x:x\in\) U and \(x\) is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that \(2\in U\) but \(2\not\in A\), because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, \(3\in U\) but \(3\not\in A\), and \(7\in U\) but \(7\not\in A\). Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set {2, 3, 7}, is called the _Complement_ of A with respect to U, and is denoted by A\({}^{\prime}\). So we have \(A^{\prime}=\{\)2, 3, 7\(\}\). Thus, we see that

\(A^{\prime}=\{x\cdot x\in U\) and \(x\not\in A\) }. This leads to the following definition.

**Definition 7**Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A\({}^{\prime}\) to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,

\(A^{\prime}=\{x:x\in U\) and \(x\not\in A\) }. Obviously A\({}^{\prime}=U-A\)

We note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set U and the set A.

**Example 20** Let \(U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}\) and \(A=\{1,3,5,7,9\}\). Find \(A^{\prime}\).

**Solution** We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of \(U\) which do not belong to \(A\). Hence \(A^{\prime}=\{2,4,6,8,10\}\).

**Example 21** Let \(U\) be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and \(A\) be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find \(A^{\prime}\).

**Solution** Since \(A\) is the set of all girls, \(A^{\prime}\) is clearly the set of all boys in the class.

**Table 1** If \(A\) is a subset of the universal set \(U\), then its complement \(A^{\prime}\) is also a subset of \(U\).

Again in Example 20 above, we have \(A^{\prime}=\{2,4,6,8,10\}\)

Hence \((A^{\prime})^{\prime}=\{x:x\in U\text{ and }x\in A^{\prime}\}\)

It is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal set \(U\), we have \((A^{\prime})^{\prime}=A\)

Now, we want to find the results for \((A\cup B\)^{\prime}\) and \(A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}\) in the followng example.

**Example 22** Let \(U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), \(A=\{2,3\}\) and \(B=\{3,4,5\}\).

Find \(A^{\prime}\), \(B^{\prime}\), \(A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}\), \(A\cup B\) and hence show that \((A\cup B\)^{\prime}=A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}\).

**Solution** Clearly \(A^{\prime}=\{1,4,5,6\}\), \(B^{\prime}=\{1,2,6\}\). Hence \(A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}=\{1,6\}\)

Also \(A\cup B=\{2,3,4,5\}\), so that \((A\cup B)^{\prime}=\{1,6\}\)

It can be shown that the above result is true in general. If \(A\) and \(B\) are any two subsets of the universal set \(U\), then

\((A\cup B\)^{\prime}=A^{\prime}\cap B^{\prime}\). Similarly, \((A\cap B\)^{\prime}=A^{\prime}\cup B^{\prime}\). These two results are stated in words as follows:

_The complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements and the complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements._ These are called _De Morgan's laws_. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan.

The complement \(A^{\prime}\) of a set \(A\) can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 10.

The shaded portion represents the complement of the set \(A\).

### Summary

This chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These are summarised below:

A set is a well-defined collection of objects.

A set which does not contain any element is called _empty set_.

A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called _finite set_, otherwise, the set is called _infinite set_.

Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.

A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element of B. Intervals are subsets of **R**.

The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either in A or in B.

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common. The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not to B.

The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A.

For any two sets A and B, (A \(\cup\) B)\({}^{\prime}\) = A\({}^{\prime}\)\(\cap\) B\({}^{\prime}\) and ( A \(\cap\) B )\({}^{\prime}\) = A\({}^{\prime}\)\(\cup\) B\({}^{\prime}\)

### Historical Note

The modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form \(a_{1}\sin x+a_{2}\sin 2x+a_{3}\sin 3x+...\) He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd several papers showing various properties of abstract sets.

Cantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970 ) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R.Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naive Set Theory' that "nothing contains everything".

The Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Godel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Godel-Bernays (GB) set theory.

Despite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.

**RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS**

**Mathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. - BERTHELOT**

**2.1 Introduction**

Much of mathematics is about finding a pattern - a recognisable link between quantities that change. In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number \(m\) is less than number \(n\), line \(l\) is parallel to line \(m\), set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The concept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other.

**2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets**

Suppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e.,

\(\mbox{A}=\{\mbox{red, blue}\}\)and \(\mbox{B}=\{b,c,s\}\),

where \(b\), \(c\) and \(s\) represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively.

How many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets?

Proceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below:

\(\mbox{(red, $b$)}\), \(\mbox{(red, $c$)}\), \(\mbox{(red, $s$)}\), \(\mbox{(blue, $b$)}\), \(\mbox{(blue, $c$)}\), \(\mbox{(blue, $s$)}\).

Thus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1).

Let us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets P and Q is a pair of elements written in smallbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., \((p,q),p\in\mathrm{P}\) and \(q\in\mathrm{Q}\). This leads to the following definition:

**Definition 1** Given two non-empty sets \(\mathrm{P}\) and \(\mathrm{Q}\). The cartesian product \(\mathrm{P}\times\mathrm{Q}\) is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from \(\mathrm{P}\) and \(\mathrm{Q}\), i.e.,

\[\mathrm{P}\times\mathrm{Q}=\{\ (p,q):p\ \in\mathrm{P},\ q\ \in\mathrm{Q}\ \}\]

If either \(\mathrm{P}\) or \(\mathrm{Q}\) is the null set, then \(\mathrm{P}\times\mathrm{Q}\) will also be empty set, i.e., \(\mathrm{P}\times\mathrm{Q}=\phi\)

From the illustration given above we note that

\[\mathrm{A}\times\mathrm{B}=\{\mathrm{(red,}b),\ \mathrm{(red,}c),\ \mathrm{(red,}s),\ \mathrm{(blue,}b),\ \mathrm{(blue,}c),\ \mathrm{(blue,}s)\}.\]

Again, consider the two sets:

\[\mathrm{A}=\{\mathrm{DL},\ \mathrm{MP},\ \mathrm{KA}\},\]

where \(\mathrm{DL}\), \(\mathrm{MP}\), \(\mathrm{KA}\) represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and \(\mathrm{B}=\{\mathrm{01,02},\ 03\}\)representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by \(\mathrm{DL}\), \(\mathrm{MP}\) and \(\mathrm{KA}\).

If the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set \(\mathrm{A}\), which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)?

The available pairs are:(\(\mathrm{DL,}\mathrm{01}\)), (\(\mathrm{DL,}\mathrm{02}\)), (\(\mathrm{DL,}\mathrm{03}\)), (\(\mathrm{MP,}\mathrm{01}\)), (\(\mathrm{MP,}\mathrm{02}\)), (\(\mathrm{MP,}\mathrm{03}\)), (\(\mathrm{KA,}\mathrm{01}\)), (\(\mathrm{KA,}\mathrm{02}\)), (\(\mathrm{KA,}\mathrm{03}\)) and the product of set \(\mathrm{A}\) and set \(\mathrm{B}\) is given by

\[\mathrm{A}\times\mathrm{B}=\{\mathrm{(DL,}\mathrm{01}),\ \mathrm{(DL,}\mathrm{02}),\ \mathrm{(DL,}\mathrm{03}),\ \mathrm{(MP,}\mathrm{01}),\ \mathrm{(MP,}\mathrm{02}),\ \mathrm{(MP,}\mathrm{03}),\ \mathrm{(KA,}\mathrm{01}),\ \mathrm{(KA,}\mathrm{02}),\]

(\(\mathrm{KA,}\mathrm{03}\))\(\}\).

It can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since there are 3 elements in each of the sets \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\). This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (\(\mathrm{DL}\), \(\mathrm{01}\)) will not be the same as the code (\(\mathrm{01}\), \(\mathrm{DL}\)).

As a final illustration, consider the two sets \(\mathrm{A}\)\(=\{a_{{}_{1}},\ a_{{}_{2}}\}\) and

\[\mathrm{B}=\{b_{{}_{1}},\ b_{{}_{2}},\ b_{{}_{3}},\ b_{{}_{4}}\},\ \mathrm{(Fig\ 2.3)}.\]

\[\mathrm{A}\times\mathrm{B}=\{\langle\bar{a_{{}_{1}}},\ b_{{}_{1}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{1}},\ b_{{}_{2}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{1}},\ b_{{}_{3}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{1}},\ b_{{}_{4}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{2}},\ b_{{}_{1}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{2}},\ b_{{}_{2}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{2}},\ b_{{}_{3}}\rangle,\ \langle a_{{}_{2}},\ b_{{}_{4}}\rangle\}.\]

The 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position \(\langle a_{{}_{1}},\ b_{{}_{2}}\rangle\) will be distinct from the point in the position \(\langle b_{{}_{2}},\ a_{{}_{1}}\rangle\).

**Remarks**

1. Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal.

2. If there are \(p\) elements in A and \(q\) elements in B, then there will be \(pq\) elements in A \(\times\) B, i.e., if \(n(\text{A})=p\) and \(n(\text{B})=q\), then \(n(\text{A}\times\text{B})=pq\).
3. If A and B are non-empty sets and either A or B is an infinite set, then so is A \(\times\) B.
4. \(\text{A}\times\text{A}\times\text{A}=\{(a,\,b,\,c):a,\,b,\,c\,\in\,\text{A}\}\). Here \((a,\,b,\,c)\) is called an _ordered triplet_.

**Example 1**: If \((x+1,\,y-2)=(3,1)\), find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

**Solution**: Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal.

Therefore \(x+1=3\) and \(y-2=1\).

Solving we get \(x=2\) and \(y=3\).

**Example 2**: If P = \(\{a,\,b,\,c\}\) and Q = \(\{r\}\), form the sets P \(\times\) Q and Q \(\times\) P.

Are these two products equal?

**Solution**: By the definition of the cartesian product,

\(\text{P}\times\text{Q}=\{(a,\,r),\,(b,\,r),\,(c,\,r)\}\) and Q \(\times\) P = \(\{(r,\,a),(r,\,b),\,(r,\,c)\}\)

Since, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair \((a,\,r)\) is not equal to the pair \((r,\,a)\), we conclude that P \(\times\) Q \(\neq\) Q \(\times\) P.

However, the number of elements in each set will be the same.

**Example 3**: Let A = \(\{1,2,3\}\), B = \(\{3,4\}\) and C = \(\{4,5,6\}\). Find

1. \(\text{A}\times\text{(B}\cap\text{C)}\) (ii) (A \(\times\) B) \(\cap\) (A \(\times\) C)
2. \(\text{A}\times\text{(B}\cup\text{C)}\) (iv) (A \(\times\) B) \(\cup\) (A \(\times\) C)

**Solution**: By the definition of the intersection of two sets, \((\text{B}\cap\text{C})=\{4\}\).

Therefore, A \(\times\) (B \(\cap\) C) = \(\{(1,4),\,(2,4),\,(3,4)\}\).

(ii) Now (A \(\times\) B) = \(\{(1,3),(1,4),\,(2,3),\,(2,4),\,(3,3),\,(3,4)\}\)

and \(\text{(A}\times\text{C)}\) = \(\{(1,4),\,(1,5),\,(1,6),\,(2,4),\,(2,5),\,(2,6),\,(3,4),\,(3,5),\,(3,6)\}\)

Therefore, \(\text{(A}\times\text{B)}\) (A \(\times\) C) = \(\{(1,4),\,(2,\,4),\,(3,\,4)\}\).

(iii) Since, \(\text{(B}\cup\text{C)}=\{3,\,4,\,5,\,6\}\), we have

A \(\times\) (B \(\cup\) C) = \(\{(1,3),\,(1,4),\,(1,5),\,(1,6),\,(2,3),\,(2,4),\,(2,5),\,(2,6),\,(3,3),\,(3,4), \(3,5),\,(3,6)\}\).

(iv) Using the sets A \(\times\) B and A \(\times\) C from part (ii) above, we obtain

\(\text{(A}\times\text{B)}\cup\text{(A}\times\text{C)}=\{(1,3),\,(1,4),\,(1,5), \,(1,6),\,(2,3),\,(2,4),\,(2,5),\,(2,6),\,(3,3),\,(3,4),\,(3,5),\,(3,6)\}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

The Cartesian product \(A\times A\) has 9 elements among which are found (-1, 0) and (0,1). Find the set \(A\) and the remaining elements of \(A\times A\).

### Relations

Consider the two sets \(P=\{a,\,b,\,c\}\) and \(Q=\{\)Ali, Bhanu, Binoy, Chandra, Divya\(\}\).

The cartesian product of

P and Q has 15 ordered pairs which

can be listed as \(P\times Q=\{(a,\text{Ali}),\)

(\(a,\text{Bhanu}\)), (\(a,\text{Binoy}\)),..., (\(c,\text{Divya}\))\(\}\).

We can now obtain a subset of

P \(\times\) Q by introducing a relation \(R\)

between the first element \(x\) and the

second element \(y\) of each ordered pair

(\(x,\,y\)) as

R= \(\{\,x,y\)): \(x\) is the first letter of the name\(y,\,x\in P,\,y\in Q\}\).

Then \(R=\{(a,\text{Ali}),\,(b,\text{Bhanu}),\,(b,\text{Binoy}),\,(c,\text{Chandra})\}\)

A visual representation of this relation \(\bar{R}\) (called an _arrow diagram_) is shown in Fig 2.4.

**Definition 2** A relation \(R\) from a non-empty set \(A\) to a non-empty set \(B\) is a subset of the cartesian product \(A\times B\). The subset is derived by describing a relationship between the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in \(A\times B\). The second element is called the _image_ of the first element.

**Definition 3** The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation \(R\) from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\) is called the _domain_ of the relation \(R\).

**Definition 4** The set of all second elements in a relation \(R\) from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\) is called the _range_ of the relation \(R\). The whole set \(B\) is called the _codomain_ of the relation \(R\). Note that range \(c\)odomain.

_Remarks_ (i): A _relation_ may be represented algebraically either by the _Roster method_ or by the _Set-builder method_.

**(ii) An arrow diagram is a visual representation of a relation.

**Example 1** Let \(A=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,6\}\). Define a relation \(R\) from \(A\) to \(A\) by

R = \(\{(x,\,y):y=\,x+1\,\}\)

(i) Depict this relation using an arrow diagram.

(ii) Write down the domain, codomain and range of \(R\).

**Solution** (i): By the definition of the relation,

R = \(\{\)(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)\(\}\).

The corresponding arrow diagram is shown in Fig 2.5.

(ii) We can see that the domain ={1,2,3,4,5,} Similarly, the range = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the codomain = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

**Example 8**: The Fig 2.6 shows a relation between the sets P and Q. Write this relation (i) in set-builder form, (ii) in roster form. What is its domain and range?

**Solution** It is obvious that the relation R is "\(x\) is the square of y".

(i) In set-builder form, \(\text{R}=\{(x,y)\colon x\) is the square of \(y\), \(x\in\text{P},y\in\text{Q}\}\)

(ii) In roster form, \(\text{R}=\{(9,3)\),

(\(9,-3\)), (\(4,2\)), (\(4,-2\)), (\(25,5\)), (\(25,-5\)).

The domain of this relation is {4,9,25}.

The range of this relation is {\(-2,2\),\(-3\), \(3\), \(-5\), 5}.

Note that the element 1 is not related to any element in set P.

The set Q is the codomain of this relation.

**Note** The total number of relations that can be defined from a set A to a set B is the number of possible subsets of A \(\times\) B. If \(n\)(A ) = \(p\) and \(n\)(B) = \(q\), then \(n\)(A \(\times\) B) = \(pq\) and the total number of relations is \(2^{pq}\).

**Example 9**: Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the number of relations from A to B.

**Solution** We have,

A \(\times\) B = {(1,3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.

Since \(n\) (A\(\times\)B ) = 4, the number of subsets of A\(\times\)B is \(2^{4}\). Therefore, the number of relations from A into B will be \(2^{4}\).

_Remark_ A relation R from A to A is also stated as a relation on A.

**EXERCISE 2.2**

### Functions

In this Section, we study a special type of relation called _function_. It is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as'map' or'mapping' used to denote a function.

**Definition 5** A relation \(f\) from a set A to a set B is said to be a _function_ if every element of set A has one and only one image in set B.

In other words, a function \(f\) is a relation from a non-empty set A to a non-empty set B such that the domain of \(f\) is A and no two distinct ordered pairs in \(f\) have the same first element.

If \(f\) is a function from A to B and (_a_, _b_) \(f\), then _f_(_a_) _= \(b\), where \(b\) is called the _image_ of \(a\) under \(f\) and \(a\) is called the _preimage_ of \(b\) under \(f\).

The function \(f\) from A to B is denoted by \(f\): A \(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}\) B.

Looking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image.

Again, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (_Why_?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not.

**Example 10**: Let \(\mathbf{N}\) be the set of natural numbers and the relation R be defined on N such that \(\ R=\{(x,y):y=2x,\,x,\,y\in\mathbf{N}\}\).

What is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function?

Solution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers \(\mathbf{N}\). The codomain is also \(\mathbf{N}\).

The range is the set of even natural numbers.

Since every natural number \(n\) has one and only one image, this relation is a function.

**Example 11**: Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not?

1. \(\mathrm{R}=\{(2,1),(3,1),(4,2)\}\), (ii) \(\mathrm{\hat{R}=\{(2,2),(2,4),(3,3),(4,4)\}}\)
2. \(\mathrm{R}=\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7)\}\)
3. \(\mathrm{Since}\ 2,\,3,\,4\) are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function.
4. \(\mathrm{Since}\ the\ same\ first\ element\ 2\) corresponds to two different images 2 and 4, this relation is not a function.
5. \(\mathrm{Since}\ every\ element\ has\ one\) and only one image, this relation is a function.

**Definition 6**: A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a _real valued function_. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a _real function_.

**Example 12**: Let \(\mathbf{N}\) be the set of natural numbers. Define a real valued function

\(f\): N\(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{       }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\) N by \(f(x)=2x+1\). Using this definition, complete the table given below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline \(y\) & \(f(1)=...\) & \(f(2)=...\) & \(f(3)=...\) & \(f(4)=...\) & \(f(5)=...\) & \(f(6)=...\) & \(f(7)=...\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Solution The completed table is given by

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline \(y\) & \(f(1)=3\) & \(f(2)=5\) & \(f(3)=7\) & \(f(4)=9\) & \(f(5)=11\) & \(f(6)=13\) & \(f(7)=\)15 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.4.1 Some functions and their graphs

(i)  **Identity function** Let \(\mathbf{R}\) be the set of real numbers. Define the real valued function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) by \(y=f(x)=x\) for each \(x\in\mathbf{R}\). Such a function is called the _identity function_. Here the domain and range of \(f\)are \(\mathbf{R}\). The graph is a straight line as shown in Fig 2.8. It passes through the origin.

(ii)  **Constant function** Define the function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) by \(y=f(x)=c\), \(x\in\mathbf{R}\) where \(c\) is a constant and each \(x\in\mathbf{R}\). Here domain of \(f\) is \(\mathbf{R}\) and its range is \(\{c\}\).

The graph is a line parallel to \(x\)-axis. For example, if \(f(x)\)=3 for each \(x\)\(\in\)\(\mathbf{R}\), then its graph will be a line as shown in the Fig 2.9.

**Polynomial function** A function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) is said to be _polynomial function_ if for each \(x\) in \(\mathbf{R},y=f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+...+a_{n}x^{n}\), where \(n\) is a non-negative integer and \(a_{0}\), \(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\),...,\(a_{n}\)\(\in\)\(\mathbf{R}\).

The functions defined by \(f(x)=x^{3}-x^{2}+2\), and \(g(x)=x^{4}+\sqrt{2}\ x\) are some examples of polynomial functions, whereas the function \(h\) defined by \(h(x)=x^{\frac{2}{3}}+2x\) is not a polynomial function.(_Why_?)

**Example 13** Define the function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) by \(y=f(x)=x^{2}\), \(x\in\mathbf{R}\). Complete the Table given below by using this definition. What is the domain and range of this function? Draw the graph of \(f\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(-\) 4 & \(-\)3 & \(-\)2 & \(-\)1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline \(y=f(x)=x^{2}\) & & & & & & & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Solution** The completed Table is given below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(-\) 4 & \(-\)3 & \(-\)2 & \(-\)1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline \(y=f(x)=x^{2}\) & 16 & 9 & 4 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 4 & 9 & 16 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Domain of \(f=\{x:x\in\)\(\mathbf{R}\}\). Range of \(f=\{x^{2}:x\in\mathbf{R}\}\). The graph of \(f\) is given by Fig 2.10

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:35]

is called the _signum function_. The domain of the signum function is \(\mathbf{R}\) and the range is the set \(\{-1,\,0,\,1\}\). The graph of the signum function is given by the Fig 2.14.

(vii) **Greatest integer function** The function \(f\): \(\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) defined by \(f(x)=[x]\), \(x\in\)\(\mathbf{R}\) assumes the value of the greatest integer, less than or equal to \(x\). Such a function is called the \(greatest\)\(integer\)\(function\).

From the definition of \([x]\), we can see that

\([x]=-1\) for \(-1\leq x<0\)

\([x]=\) 0 for \(0\leq x<1\)

\([x]=\) 1 for \(1\leq x<2\)

\([x]=\) 2 for \(2\leq x\leq 3\) and

so on.

The graph of the function is shown in Fig 2.15.

#### 2.4.2 Algebra of real functions

In this Section, we shall learn how to add two real functions, subtract a real function from another, multiply a real function by a scalar (here by a scalar we mean a real number), multiply two real functions and divide one real function by another.

(i) **Addition of two real functions** Let \(f\): \(\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) and \(g:\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) be any two real functions, where \(\mathrm{X}\subset\mathbf{R}\). Then, we define \((f^{+}g)\): \(\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) by

\((f^{+}g)\)\((x)=f(x)+g\)\((x)\), for all \(x\in\mathrm{X}\).

Figure 2.14:

2. **Subtraction of a real function from another** Let\(f\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) and \(g\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) be any two real functions, where \(\mathrm{X}\subset\mathbf{R}\). Then, we define \((f-g):\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) by \((f-g)\)\((x)=f(x)-g(x)\), for all \(x\in\mathrm{X}\).
3. **Multiplication by a scalar** Let\(f\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) be a real valued function and \(\alpha\) be a scalar. Here by scalar, we mean a real number. Then the product \(\alpha f\) is a function from \(\mathrm{X}\) to \(\mathbf{R}\) defined by \((\alpha f)\)\((x)=\alpha f(x)\), \(x\in\mathrm{X}\).
4. **Multiplication of two real functions** The product (or multiplication) of two real functions \(f\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) and \(g\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) is a function \(fg\colon\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\) defined by \((fg)\)\((x)=f(x)\)\(g(x)\), for all \(x\in\mathrm{X}\). This is also called _pointwise multiplication_.
5. **Quotient of two real functions** Let\(f\) and \(g\) be two real functions defined from \(\mathrm{X}\to\mathbf{R}\), where \(\mathrm{X}\subset\mathbf{R}\). The quotient of \(f\) by \(g\) denoted by \(\dfrac{f}{g}\) is a function defined by, \(\dfrac{f}{g}\)\((x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), provided \(g(x)\neq 0,x\in\mathrm{X}\)

**Example 16** Let\(f(x)=x^{2}\) and \(g(x)=2x+1\) be two real functions.Find

**Solution** We have,

\((f+g)\)\((x)=x^{2}+2x+1\), \((f-g)\)\((x)=x^{2}-2x-1\),

\((f\mathrm{g})\)\((x)=x^{2}\)\((2x+1)=2x^{3}+x^{2}\), \(\dfrac{f}{g}\)\((x)=\dfrac{x^{2}}{2x+1}\), \(x\neq-\dfrac{1}{2}\)

**Example 17** Let\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\) and \(g(x)=x\) be two functions defined over the set of non-negative real numbers. Find \((f+g)\)\((x)\), \((f-g)\)\((x)\), \((fg)\)\((x)\) and \(\dfrac{f}{g}\)\((x)\).

**Solution** We have

\((f+g)\)\((x)=\sqrt{x}+x\), \((f-g)\)\((x)=\sqrt{x}\)\(-x\),

\((fg)\)\(x=\sqrt{x}(x)=x^{3}\)\(-x^{2}\)\(-x^{3}\)\(-x^{2}\), \(x\neq 0\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:38]

**Example 19**: Let R be a relation from **Q** to **Q** defined by R = {(_a,b_): _a,b_\(\in\)**Q** and _a - b_\(\in\)**Z**}. Show that

1. (_a_,_a_) \(\in\) R for all _a_\(\in\)**Q**
2. (_a_,_b_) \(\in\) R implies that (_b_, _a_) \(\in\) R
3. (_a_,_b_) \(\in\) R and (_b_,_c_) \(\in\) R implies that (_a_,_c_) \(\in\)R

**Solution**: (i) Since, _a - a_\(=\) **Z**, if follows that (_a_, _a_) \(\in\) R.
2. (_a_,_b_) \(\in\) R implies that _a - b_\(\in\)**Z**. So, _b - a_\(\in\)**Z**. Therefore, (_b_, _a_) \(\in\) R
3. (_a_, _b_) and (_b_, _c_) \(\in\) R implies that _a - b_\(\in\)**Z**. _b - c_\(\in\)**Z**. So, _a - c_\(=\) (_a - b_) + (_b_-c_) \(\in\)**Z**. Therefore, (_a_,_c_) \(\in\) R

**Example 20**: Let _f_= {(1,1), (2,3), (0,-1), (-1,-3)} be a linear function from **Z** into **Z**. Find _f_(_x_).

**Solution**: Since _x_\({}^{2}\) -5\(x\) + 4 = (_x_ - 4) (_x_ = 1), the function_f_ is defined for all real numbers except at \(x\) = 4 and \(x\) = 1. Hence the domain of \(f\) is **R** - {1, 4}.

**Example 22**: The function \(f\) is defined by

Draw the graph of _f_(_x_):

**Solution**: Here, _f_(_x_) = 1 \(x\), \(x\) < 0, this gives

_f_(- 4) = 1 - (-4) = 5;

_f_(- 3) =1 - (-3) = 4,

_f_(- 2) = 1 - (-2) = 3

_f_(-1) = 1 - (-1) = 2; etc,

and _f_(1) = 2,_f_(2) = 3,_f_(3) = 4

_f_(4) = 5 and so on for _f_(_x_) = \(x\) + 1, \(x\) > 0.

Thus, the graph of \(f\) is as shown in Fig 2.17

### Summary

In this Chapter, we studied about relations and functions.The main features of this Chapter are as follows:

* _Ordered pair_ A pair of elements grouped together in a particular order.
* _Cartesian product_ A \(\times\) B of two sets A and B is given by \(\text{A}\times\text{B}=\ \{(a,\,b):\,a\in\text{A},\,b\in\text{B}\}\) In particular \(\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}=\{(x,y):\,x,\,y\in\mathbf{R}\}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}=\{(x,y,z):\,x,\,y,\,z\in\mathbf{R}\}\)
* If \((a,\,b)=(x,y)\), then \(a=x\) and \(b=y\).
* If \(n(\text{A})=p\) and \(n(\text{B})=q\), then \(n(\text{A}\times\text{B})=pq\).

### Historical Note

The word FUNCTION first appears in a Latin manuscript "Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de fuctionibus" written by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716) in 1673; Leibnitz used the word in the non-analytical sense. He considered a function in terms of "mathematical job" the "employee" being just a curve.

On July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term _function_ in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval.

_Function is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: "The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities"._

## 3 Trigonometric functions

### Introduction

The word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words _'trigon'_ and _'metron'_ and it means'measuring the sides of a triangle'. The subject was originally developed to solve geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a musical tone and in many other areas.

In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and study their properties.

### Angles

Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:44]

#### 3.2.2. _Radian measure_

There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called the _radian_ measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig 3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, \(-1\) radian, \(1\frac{1}{2}\) radian and \(-1\frac{1}{2}\) radian.

We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is \(2\pi\). Thus, one complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of \(2\pi\) radian.

More generally, in a circle of radius \(r\), an arc of length \(r\) will subtend an angle of 1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre. Since in a circle of radius \(r\), an arc of length \(r\) subtends an angle whose measure is 1 radian, an arc of length \(l\) will subtend an angle whose measure is \(\frac{l}{r}\) radian. Thus, if in a circle of radius \(r\), an arc of length \(l\) subtends an angle \(\theta\) radian at the centre, we have \(\theta\ =\ \frac{l}{r}\) or \(l\ =r\ \theta\).

#### 3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers

Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle. Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the real number zero, AP represents positive real number and AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real number will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can be considered as one and the same.

#### 3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian

Since a circle subtends at the centre an angle whose radian measure is \(2\pi\) and its degree measure is \(360^{\circ}\), it follows that

\[2\pi\text{ radian}=360^{\circ}\quad\text{ or }\pi\text{ radian}=\overline{180^{\circ}}\]

The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value of \(\pi\) as \(\dfrac{22}{7}\), we have

\[1\text{ radian}=\dfrac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}=57^{\circ}16^{\prime}\text{ approximately}.\]

Also \(1^{\circ}=\dfrac{\pi}{180}\text{ radian}=0.01746\) radian approximately.

The relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles are given in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Degree & \(30^{\circ}\) & \(45^{\circ}\) & \(60^{\circ}\) & \(90^{\circ}\) & \(180^{\circ}\) & \(270^{\circ}\) & \(360^{\circ}\) \\ \hline Radian & \(\dfrac{\pi}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\) & \(\dfrac{\pi}{3}\) & \(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\) & \(\pi\) & \(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\) & \(2\pi\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Notational Convention**

Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention that whenever we write angle \(\theta^{\circ}\), we mean the angle whose degree measure is \(\theta\) and whenever we write angle \(\beta\), we mean the angle whose radian measure is \(\beta\).

Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word 'radian' is frequently omitted. Thus, \(\pi=180^{\circ}\)_and_\(\frac{\pi}{4}=45^{\circ}\) are written with the understanding that \(\pi\) and \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) are radian measures. Thus, we can say that

\[\text{Radian measure}=\frac{\pi}{180}\ \times\text{Degree measure}\]

\[\text{Degree measure}=\frac{\cdot 180}{\pi}\times\text{Radian measure}\]

**Example 1**: Convert \(40^{\circ}\ 20^{\prime}\) into radian measure.
**Solution**: We know that \(180^{\circ}=\pi\) radian. Hence \(40^{\circ}\ 20^{\prime}=40\ \frac{1}{3}\ \text{degree}=\frac{\pi}{180}\times\frac{121}{3}\ \text{radian}=\frac{121\pi}{540}\) radian. Therefore \(40^{\circ}\ 20^{\prime}=\frac{121\pi}{540}\) radian.
**Example 2**: Convert 6 radians into degree measure.
**Solution**: We know that \(\pi\) radian \(=180^{\circ}\). Hence \(6\) radians \(=\frac{\cdot 180}{\pi}\times 6\ \text{degree}=\frac{\cdot 1080\times 7}{22}\) degree \(=343^{\circ}+\frac{\cdot 7\times 60}{11}\ \text{minute}\) [as \(1^{\circ}\ =60^{\prime}\)] \(=343^{\circ}+38^{\prime}\ +\frac{2}{11}\ \text{minute}\) [as \(1^{\prime}=60^{\prime\prime}\)] \(=343^{\circ}+38^{\prime}+10.9^{\prime\prime}\) \(=343^{\circ}38^{\prime}\ 11^{\prime\prime}\) approximately. Hence \(6\) radians \(=343^{\circ}\ 38^{\prime}\ 11^{\prime\prime}\) approximately.
**Example 3**: Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of \(60^{\circ}\) intercepts an arc of length \(37.4\ \text{cm}\) (use \(\pi=\frac{22}{\gamma}\)).

**Solution**: Here \(l=37.4\) cm and \(\theta=60^{\circ}=\dfrac{60\pi}{180}\) radian \(=\dfrac{\pi}{3}\)

Hence, by \(r=\dfrac{l}{\theta}\), we have

\[r=\dfrac{\dot{37.4\times 3}}{\pi}=\dfrac{37.4\times 3\times 7}{22}=35.7\) cm

**Example 4**: The minute hand of a watch is 1.5 cm long. How far does its tip move in 40 minutes? (Use \(\pi=3.14\)).

**Solution**: In 60 minutes, the minute hand of a watch completes one revolution. Therefore, in 40 minutes, the minute hand turns through \(\dfrac{2}{3}\) of a revolution. Therefore, or \(\dfrac{4\pi}{3}\) radian. Hence, the required distance travelled is given by

\[l=r\ \theta\ =\ 1.5\times\dfrac{4\pi}{3}\ \text{cm}=2\pi\ \text{cm}=2\times 3,14\ \text{cm}=6.28\ \text{cm}.\]

**Example 5**: If the arcs of the same lengths in two circles subtend angles \(65^{\circ}\)and \(110^{\circ}\) at the centre, find the ratio of their radii.

**Solution**: Let \(r_{{}_{I}}\) and \(r_{{}_{2}}\) be the radii of the two circles. Given that

\[\theta_{{}_{1}}=65^{\circ}=\dfrac{\pi}{180}\times 65=\dfrac{13\pi}{36}\ \text{radian}\]

and

\[\theta_{{}_{2}}=110^{\circ}=\dfrac{\pi}{180}\times 110=\dfrac{22\pi}{36}\ \text{radian}\]

Let \(l\) be the length of each of the arc. Then \(l=\ r_{{}_{1}}\theta_{{}_{1}}=\ r_{{}_{2}}\theta_{{}_{2}}\), which gives

Hence

\[r_{{}_{1}}:r_{{}_{2}}=22:13.\]

**Example 3.1**: Find the radian measures corresponding to the following degree measures:

(i) \(25^{\circ}\) (ii) \(-47^{\circ}30^{\prime}\) (iii) \(240^{\circ}\) (iv) \(520^{\circ}\)
2. Find the degree measures corresponding to the following radian measures. (Use \(\pi=\frac{22}{7}\) ). (i) \(\frac{11}{16}\) (ii) \(-4\) (iii) \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) (iv) \(\frac{7\pi}{6}\)
3. A wheel makes 360 revolutions in one minute. Through how many radians does it turn in one second?
4. Find the degree measure of the angle subtended at the centre of a circle of radius 100 cm by an arc of length 22 cm (Use \(\pi=\frac{22}{7}\)).
5. In a circle of diameter 40 cm, the length of a chord is 20 cm. Find the length of minor arc of the chord.
6. If in two circles, arcs of the same length subtend angles \(60^{\circ}\) and \(75^{\circ}\) at the centre, find the ratio of their radii.
7. Find the angle in radian through which a pendulum swings if its length is 75 cm and th e tip describes an arc of length (i) 10 cm (ii) 15 cm (iii) 21 cm.

### Trigonometric Functions

In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.

Consider a unit circle with centre at origin of the coordinate axes. Let P (\(a\), \(b\)) be any point on the circle with angle AOP = \(x\) radian, i.e., length of arc AP = \(x\) (Fig 3.6).

We define \(\cos x=a\) and \(\sin x=b\) Since \(\Delta\)OMP is a right triangle, we have \(\mbox{OM}^{2}+\mbox{MP}^{2}=\mbox{OP}^{2}\) or \(a^{2}+b^{2}=1\). Thus, for every point on the unit circle, we have

\(a^{2}+b^{2}=1\) or \(\cos^{2}x+\sin^{2}x=1\)

Since one complete revolution subtends an angle of \(2\pi\) radian at the centre of the circle, \(\angle\mbox{AOB}=\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\mbox{Fig 3.6}\)\(\angle\)AOC = \(\pi\) and \(\angle\)AOD = \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\). All angles which are integral multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) are called _quadrantal angles_. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively, (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have

\(\cos\,0^{\circ}=1\)\(\sin\,0^{\circ}=0\),

\(\cdot\)\(\cos\,\frac{\pi}{2}=0\)\(\sin\,\frac{\pi}{2}=1\)

\(\cos\pi=-1\)\(\sin\pi=0\)

\(\cos\,\frac{3\pi}{2}=0\)\(\sin\,\frac{3\pi}{2}=-1\)

\(\cos\,2\pi=1\)\(\sin\,2\pi=0\)

Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to same point P. Thus, we also observe that if \(x\) increases (or decreases) by any integral multiple of \(2\pi\), the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,

\(\sin\,(2n\pi+x)\,=\sin x\), \(n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\mathcal{S}}\)\(\cos\,(2n\pi+\bar{x})=\cos\bar{x}\), \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\)

Further, \(\sin\,x=0\), if \(x=0\), \(\pm\pi\), \(\pm 2\pi\), \(\pm 3\pi\), \(\cdot\), i.e., when \(x\) is an integral multiple of \(\pi\) and \(\cos\,x=0\), if \(x=\pm\)\(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\pm\frac{3\pi}{2}\), \(\pm\frac{5\pi}{2}\), \(\cdot\)..

We have shown that for all real \(x,\ \sin^{2}x+\cos^{2}x=1\)

It follows that

\[1+\tan^{2}x=\sec^{2}x\qquad\quad(\text{why?})\]

\[1+\cot^{2}x=\cos\sec^{2}x\qquad(\text{why?})\]

In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for \(0^{\circ}\), \(30^{\circ}\), \(45^{\circ}\), \(60^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\). The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following table:

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline&0^{\circ}&\dfrac{\pi}{6}&\dfrac{\pi} {4}&\dfrac{\pi}{3}&\dfrac{\pi}{2}&\pi&\dfrac{3\pi}{2}&2\pi\\ \hline\sin&0&\dfrac{1}{2}&\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&1&0&-1&0\\ \hline\cos&1&\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\dfrac{1}{2}&0&-1&0&1\\ \hline\tan&0&\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&1&\sqrt{3}&\text{not}&0&\text{not}&0&\text{ not}&0\\ \hline\end{array}\]

The values of cosec \(x\), see \(x\) and \(\cot x\) are the reciprocal of the values of \(\sin x\), \(\cos x\) and \(\tan x\), respectively.

#### 3.3.1 Sign of trigonometric functions

Let P (\(a\), \(b\)) be a point on the unit circle with centre at the origin such that \(\angle\)AOP \(=x\). If \(\angle\)AQO\({}^{\prime}\)\(=-\)\(x\), then the coordinates of the point Q will be (\(a\), \(-b\)) (Fig 3.7). Therefore

\[\cos\ (-x)=\cos x\]

and \(\sin\ (-x)=-\sin x\)

Since for every point P (\(a\), \(b\)) on the unit circle, \(-1\leq a\leq 1\) and Fig 3.7\(-1\leq\ b\leq 1\), we have \(-1\leq\cos\ x\leq 1\) and \(-1\leq\sin\ x\leq 1\) for all \(x\). We have learnt in previous classes that in the first quadrant \((0<x<\frac{\pi}{2}\ )\ a\) and \(b\) are both positive, in the second quadrant \((\frac{\pi}{2}\ <x<\!\pi)\ a\) is negative and \(b\) is positive, in the third quadrant \((\pi<x<\frac{3\pi}{2}\ )\ a\) and \(b\) are both negative and in the fourth quadrant \((\frac{3\pi}{2}\ <x<2\pi)\ a\) is positive and \(b\) is negative. Therefore, \(\sin\ x\) is positive for \(0<x<\pi\), and negative for \(\pi<x<2\pi\). Similarly, \(\cos\ x\) is positive for \(0<x<\frac{\pi}{2}\ \text{, negative for }\frac{\pi}{2}<x<\frac{3\pi}{2}\ \text{and also}\) positive for \(\frac{3\pi}{2}<\ x<2\pi\). Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & I & II & III & IV \\ \hline \(\sin x\) & \(+\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \(\cos x\) & \(+\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(+\) \\ \hline \(\tan x\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(+\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \(\cos\ x\) & \(+\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \(\sec\ x\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(-\) & \(+\) \\ \hline \(\cot x\) & \(+\) & \(-\) & \(+\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.3.2 Domain and range of trigonometric functions

From the definition of sine and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further, we observe that for each real number \(x\),

\[-1\leq\sin\ x\leq 1\ \text{and}\ -1\leq\cos\ x\leq 1\]

Thus, domain of \(y=\sin x\) and \(y=\cos x\) is the set of all real numbers and range is the interval [-1, 1], i.e., \(-1\leq y\leq 1\).

Since cosec \(x=\dfrac{1}{\sin x}\), the domain of \(y=\) cosec \(x\) is the set \(\{\ x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq n\ \pi,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and range is the set \(\{y:y\in\mathbf{R},y\geq 1\ \text{or}\ y\leq-1\}\). Similarly, the domain of \(y=\) sec \(x\) is the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq(2n+1)\ \dfrac{\pi}{2}\,\ n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and range is the set \(\{y:y\ \in\mathbf{R},y\ \leq-\ 1\ \text{or}\ y\geq 1\}\). The domain of \(y=\tan x\) is the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq(2n+1)\ \dfrac{\pi}{2}\,\ n\in\mathbf{Z}_{\}\}\) and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of \(y=\) cot \(x\) is the set \(\{x:x\ \in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq n\ \pi,\,n\in\mathbf{Z}_{\}\}\) and the range is the set of all real numbers.

We further observe that in the first quadrant, as \(x\) increases from 0 to \(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\), \(\sin x\) increases from 0 to 1, as \(x\) increases from \(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\pi,\sin x\) decreases from 1 to 0. In the third quadrant, as \(x\) increases from \(\pi\) to \(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\,\sin x\) decreases from 0 to \(-1\)and finally, in the fourth quadrant, \(\sin x\) increases from \(-1\) to 0 as \(x\) increases from \(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\) to \(2\pi\). Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we have the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & I quadrant & II quadrant & III quadrant & IV quadrant \\ \hline sin & increases from 0 to 1 & decreases from 1 to 0 & decreases from 0 to \(-1\) & increases from \(-1\) to 0 \\ \hline cos & decreases from 1 to 0 & decreases from 0 to \(-1\) & increases from \(-1\) to 0 & increases from 0 to 1 \\ \hline tan & increases from 0 to \(\infty\) & increases from \(-\infty\)to 0 & increases from 0 to \(\infty\) & increases from \(-\infty\)to 0 \\ \hline cot & decreases from \(\infty\) to 0 & decreases from 0 to\(-\infty\) & decreases from \(\infty\) to 0 & decreases from 0to \(-\infty\) \\ \hline sec & increases from \(1\) to \(\infty\) & increases from \(-\infty\)to\(-1\) & decreases from \(-1\)to\(-\infty\) & decreases from \(\infty\) to 1 \\ \hline cosec & decreases from \(\infty\) to 1 & increases from 1 to \(\infty\) & increases from \(-\infty\)to\(-1\) & decreases from \(-1\)to\(-\infty\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(Remark\)In the above table, the statement \(\tan x\) increases from 0 to \(\infty\) (infinity) for \(0<x<\dfrac{\pi}{2}\) simply means that \(\tan x\) increases as \(x\) increases for \(0<x<\dfrac{\pi}{2}\) and assumes arbitrarily large positive values as \(x\) approaches to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Similarly, to say that cosec \(x\) decreases from \(-1\) to \(-\infty\) (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that cosec \(x\) decreases for \(x\in(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), \(2\pi)\) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as \(x\) approaches to \(2\pi\). The symbols \(\infty\) and \(-\infty\) simply specify certain types of behaviour of functions and variables.

We have already seen that values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) repeats after an interval of \(2\pi\). Hence, values of cosec \(x\) and sec \(x\) will also repeat after an interval of \(2\pi\). Weshall see in the next section that \(\tan\left(\pi+x\right)=\tan x\). Hence, values of \(\tan x\) will repeat after an interval of \(\pi\). Since \(\cot x\) is reciprocal of \(\tan x\), its values will also repeat after an interval of \(\pi\). Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometric functions, we can sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:

**Example 6**: If \(\cos x=-\ \frac{3}{5}\), \(x\) lies in the third quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions.
**Solution**: Since \(\cos x=-\frac{3}{5}\), we have \(\sec x=-\frac{5}{3}\)

Now \(\sin^{2}x+\cos^{2}x=1\), \(\sin^{2}x=1-\cos^{2}x\)

or \(\sin^{2}x=1\), \(\frac{9}{25}=\frac{16}{25}\)

Hence \(\sin x=\frac{4}{5}\)

Since \(x\) lies in third quadrant, \(\sin x\) is negative. Therefore

\(\sin x=-\ \frac{4}{5}\)

which also gives

\(\cos\)\(x=-\ \frac{5}{4}\)Further, we have

\[\tan x=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{sin\,x}}{cosx}=\frac{4}{3}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \cot x=\frac{ \overset{\cdot}{cos\,x}}{sin\,x}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{3}}{4}\,.\]

**Example 7**: If \(\cot x=-\ \frac{5}{12}\,,\,x\) lies in second quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions.

**Solution**: Since \(\cot x=-\ \frac{5}{12}\,,\) we have \(\tan x=-\ \frac{12}{5}\)

Now \(\sec^{2}x=1+\tan^{2}x=1+\frac{\overset{\cdot}{144}}{25}=\frac{169}{25}\)

Hence \(\sec x=\pm\ \frac{13}{5}\)

Since \(x\) lies in second quadrant, \(\sec x\) will be negative. Therefore

\(\sec x=-\ \frac{13}{5}\,,\)

which also gives

\(\cos x=-\ \frac{5}{13}\)

Further, we have

\(\sin x=\tan x\cos x=(-\ \frac{12}{5})\times(-\ \frac{5}{13})=\frac{12}{13}\)

and \(\cos x=\frac{1}{sin\,x}=\frac{13}{12}\,.\)

**Example 8**: Find the value of \(\sin\ \frac{31\pi}{3}\,.\)

**Solution**: We know that values of \(\sin x\) repeats after an interval of \(2\pi\). Therefore

\[\sin\ \frac{31\pi}{3}=\sin\ (10\pi+\frac{\pi}{3}\,)=\sin\ \frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{ \sqrt{3}}{2}\,.\]

**Example 9**: Find the value of \(\cos\) (\(-1710^{\circ}\)).

**Solution** We know that values of \(\cos\)\(x\) repeats after an interval of \(2\pi\) or \(360^{\circ}\). Therefore, \(\cos\) (\(-1710^{\circ}\)) = \(\cos\) (\(-1710^{\circ}+5\times 360^{\circ}\))

\(=\cos\) (\(-1710^{\circ}+1800^{\circ}\)) = \(\cos\)\(90^{\circ}\) = 0.

### Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles

In this Section, we shall derive expressions for trigonometric functions of the sum and difference of two numbers (angles) and related expressions. The basic results in this connection are called _trigonometric identities_. We have seen that

1. **sin (- \(x\))** = - **sin \(x\)**
2. **cos (- \(x\))** = **cos \(x\)**

We shall now prove some more results:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:58]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:59]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:60]

Since, none of the \(x\), \(y\) and \((x+y)\) is multiple of \(\pi\), we find that \(\sin x\ \sin y\) and \(\sin\ (x+y)\) are non-zero. Now,

\[\cot\ (\ x+y) =\frac{\cdot}{\sin\ (x+y)}=\frac{\cos\ x\ \cos\ y-\sin\ x\sin\ y}{ \sin\ x\ \cos\ y+\cos\ x\sin\ y}\] Dividing numerator and denominator by \(\sin x\sin y\), we have \[\cot\ (x+y) =\frac{\cdot}{\cot x\cot y-1}{\cot y+\cot x}\]
13. **cot (x-y)**=\(\frac{\cdot}{\cot x\cot y+1}\) if none of angles \(x\), \(y\) and \(x\)-\(y\) is a multiple of \(\pi\).

If we replace \(y\) by \(-y\) in identity 12, we get the result

14. **cos 2x = cos\({}^{2}\)x - sin\({}^{2}\)x = 2 cos\({}^{2}\)x - 1 - 2 sin\({}^{2}\)x = 1 - \({}^{2}\)x

We know that

\[\cos\ (x+y) =\cos\ x\ \cos\ y-\sin\ x\sin\ y\] Replacing \(y\) by \(x\), we get \[\cos\ 2x =\cos^{2}x-\sin^{2}x\] \[=\cos^{2}x-(1-\cos^{2}x)=2\cos^{2}x-1\] Again, \[\cos\ 2x =\cos^{2}x-\sin^{2}x\] \[=1-\sin^{2}x-\sin^{2}x=1-2\ \sin^{2}x.\]

We have \[\cos\ 2x =\cos^{2}x-\sin^{2}x

23. \(\tan 4x=\frac{4\tan x\ (1-\tan^{2}x)}{1-6\tan^{2}x+\tan^{4}x}\) 24. \(\cos 4x=1-8\sin^{2}x\ \cos^{2}x\)
25. \(\cos 6x=32\ \cos^{6}x-48\cos^{4}x+18\ \cos^{2}x-1\)

\[\text{{Miscellaneous Examples}}\]

**Example 18**: If \(\sin x=\frac{3}{5}\), \(\cos y=-\frac{12}{13}\), where \(x\) and \(y\) both lie in second quadrant, find the value of \(\sin(x+y)\).

SolutionWe know that

\(\sin\ (x+y)=\sin x\ \cos y+\cos x\ \sin y\)

Now \(\cos^{2}x=1-\sin^{2}x=1-\frac{9}{25}=\frac{16}{25}\)

Therefore \(\cos x=\pm\frac{4}{5}\).

Since \(x\) lies in second quadrant, \(\cos x\) is negative.

Hence \(\cos x=-\frac{4}{5}\)

Now \(\sin^{2}\!y=1-\cos^{2}\!y=1-\frac{144}{169}=\frac{25}{169}\)

i.e. \(\sin y=\pm\frac{5}{13}\).

Since \(y\) lies in second quadrant, hence \(\sin y\) is positive. Therefore, \(\sin y=\frac{5}{13}\). Substituting the values of \(\sin x,\sin y\), \(\cos x\) and \(\cos y\) in (1), we get

\[\text{{sin($x+y$)}}=\frac{3}{5}\times\left(-\frac{12}{13}\right)+\left(-\frac {4}{5}\right)\times\frac{5}{13}\qquad=\ -\frac{36}{65}-\frac{20}{65}=-\frac{56}{65}.\]

**Example 19**: Prove that

\(\cos 2x\ \cos\frac{x}{2}-\cos 3x\ \cos\frac{9x}{2}=\sin 5x\ \sin\frac{5x}{2}\).

SolutionWe have \[\begin{split}\text{L.H.S.}&=\frac{1}{2}\left[2\cos 2x\cos \frac{x}{2}-2\cos\frac{9x}{2}\cos 3x\right]\\ &.\\ &=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{[}\cos\!\left(2x+\frac{x}{2}\right)+\cos \left(2x-\frac{x}{2}\right)-\cos\!\left(\frac{9x}{2}+3x\right)-\cos\!\left( \frac{9x}{2}-3x\right)\right]\\ &=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{[}cos\frac{5x}{2}+cos\frac{3x}{2}-cos\frac{ 15x}{2}-cos\frac{3x}{2}\Bigg{]}=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{[}cos\frac{5x}{2}-cos\frac{ 15x}{2}\Bigg{]}\\ &.\\ &=-sin\,5x\ sin\!\left(-\frac{5x}{2}\right)=sin\,5x\ sin\!\frac{5x}{2}= \text{R.H.S.}\\ \end{split}\]

**Example 20**: Find the value of \(\tan\frac{\pi}{8}\).
**Solution**: Let \(x=\frac{\pi}{8}\). Then \(\frac{2x=\frac{\pi}{4}}{4}\).
**Now**: \(tan\,2x=\frac{2\tan x}{1-tan^{2}x}\)
**or**: \(tan\frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{2\tan\frac{\pi}{8}}{1-tan^{2}\frac{\pi}{8}}\)
**Let \(y=\tan\frac{\pi}{8}\). Then \(1=\frac{2y}{1-y^{2}}\) or**: \(y^{2}+2y-1=0\)
**Therefore**: \(y=\frac{\cdot-2\pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}=-1\pm\sqrt{2}\)\(\cdot\).

Since \(\frac{\pi}{8}\) lies in the first quadrant, \(y=\tan\ \frac{\pi}{8}\) is positve. Hence

\(\cdot\).

\(\tan\frac{\pi}{8}=\sqrt{2}-1\).

**Example 21**: If \(\tan\ x=\frac{3}{4}\), \(\pi<x<\frac{3\pi}{2}\), find the value of \(\sin\frac{x}{2}\), \(\cos\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\tan\frac{x}{2}\).

\(\cdot\).

**Solution** Since \(\pi<x<\frac{3\pi}{2}\), \(\cos x\) is negative.

Also \(\cdot\).

Therefore, \(\sin\frac{x}{2}\) is positive and \(\cos\frac{x}{2}\) is negative.

Now \(\sec^{2}x=1+\tan^{2}x=1+\frac{9}{16}=\frac{25}{16}\)

Therefore \(\cos^{2}x=\frac{16}{25}\) or \(\cos x=-\frac{4}{5}\) (Why?)

Now \(2\sin^{2}\frac{x}{2}=1-\cos x=1+\frac{4}{5}=\frac{9}{5}\).

Therefore \(\sin^{2}\frac{x}{2}=\frac{9}{10}\) or \(\sin\frac{x}{2}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\) (Why?)

Again \(2\cos^{2}\frac{x}{2}=1+\cos x=1-\frac{4}{5}=\frac{1}{5}\)

Therefore \(\cos^{2}\frac{x}{2}=\frac{1}{10}\)

\[\cdot\]

Hence \[\tan\frac{\cdot}{2}=\frac{sin\frac{x}{2}}{cos\frac{x}{2}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \times\left(\frac{-\sqrt{10}}{1}\right)=-3.\]

The symbols \(\sin^{-1}x\), \(\cos^{-1}x\), etc., for arc \(\sin x\), arc \(\cos x\), etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios:

\[\frac{\cdot}{S}=\frac{h}{s}=\tan\,(\text{sun's altitude})\]

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.

## 4 Mathematics is the Queen of Sciences and Arithmetic is the Queen of Mathematics. - GAUSS [5]

### Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one and two variables and quadratic equations in one variable. We have seen that the equation \(x^{2}+bx+\bar{c}=0\) has no real solution as \(x^{2}+1=0\) gives \(x^{2}=-1\) and square of every real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the real number system to a larger system so that we can find the solution of the equation \(x^{2}=-1\). In fact, the main objective is to solve the equation \(ax^{2}+bx+\bar{c}=0\), where \(D=b^{2}-\ 4ac<0\), which is not possible in the system of real numbers.

### Complex Numbers

Let us denote \(\cdot\sqrt{-1}\) by the symbol \(i\). Then, we have \(i^{2}=-1\). This means that \(i\) is a solution of the equation \(x^{2}+1=0\).

A number of the form \(a+ib\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, is defined to be a complex number. For example, \(2+i3,\ (-1)+\overset{\cdot}{i\sqrt{3}}\,\ 4+i\left(\frac{-1}{11}\right)\) are complex numbers.

For the complex number \(z=a+ib\), \(a\) is called the _real part_, denoted by \(\mathrm{Re}\ z\) and \(b\) is called the _imaginary part_ denoted by \(\mathrm{Im}\ z\)_of the complex number \(z\)_. For example, if \(z=2+i5\), then \(\mathrm{Re}\ z=2\) and \(\mathrm{Im}\ z=5\).

Two complex numbers \(z_{{}_{1}}=a+ib\) and \(z_{{}_{2}}=c+id\) are equal if \(a=c\) and \(b=d\).

**Example 1** If \(4x+i(3x-y)=3+i\) (- 6), where \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers, then find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

**Solution** We have

\[4x+i\ (3x-y)=3+i\ (-6)\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\...\ (1)\]

Equating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get

\[4x=3,\ 3x-y=-6,\qquad\qquad\qquad\.\]

which, on solving simultaneously, give \(x=\dfrac{3}{4}\) and \(y=\dfrac{33}{4}\).

### Algebra of Complex Numbers

In this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers.

#### 4.3.1 Addition of two complex numbers

Let \(z_{1}=a+ib\) and \(z_{2}=e+id\) be any two complex numbers. Then, the sum \(z_{1}+z_{2}\) is defined as follows:

\(z_{1}+z_{2}=(a+c)+i\ (b+d)\), which is again a complex number.

For example, \((2+i3)+(-6+i5)=(2-6)+i\ (3+5)=-4+i8\)

The addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties:

1. _The closure law_ The sum of two complex numbers is a complex number, i.e., \(z_{1}+z_{2}\) is a complex number for all complex numbers \(z_{1}\) and \(z_{2}\).
2. _The commutative law_ For any two complex numbers \(z_{1}\) and \(z_{2}\), \(z_{1}+z_{2}=z_{2}+z_{1}\)
3. _The associative law_ For any three complex numbers \(z_{1}\), \(z_{2}\), \(z_{3}\), \((z_{1}+z_{2})+z_{3}=z_{1}+(z_{2}+z_{3})\).
4. _The existence of additive identity_ There exists the complex number \(0+i\ 0\) (denoted as \(0\)), called the _additive identity_ or the _zero complex number_, such that, for every complex number \(z,z+0=z\).
5. _The existence of additive inverse_ To every complex number \(z=a+ib\), we have the complex number - \(a+i(-b)\) (denoted as \(-\ z\)), called the _additive inverse_ or _negative of \(z\)_. We observe that \(z+(-z)=0\) (the additive identity).

#### 4.3.2 Difference of two complex numbers

Given any two complex numbers \(z_{1}\) and \(z_{2}\), the difference \(z_{1}-z_{2}\) is defined as follows:

\[z_{1}-z_{2}=z_{1}+(-z_{2}).\]

For example, \((6+3i)-(2-i)=(6+3i)+(-2+i\ )=4+4i\)

and

\[(2-\ i)-(6+3i)=(2-i)+(-6-3i)=-4-4i\]

### Argand Plane and Polar Representation

We already know that corresponding to each ordered pair of real numbers \((x,y)\), we get a unique point in the XY-plane and vice-versa with reference to a set of mutually perpendicular lines known as the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. The complex number \(x+iy\) which corresponds to the ordered pair \((x,\,y)\) can be represented geometrically as the unique point \(\mathrm{P}(x,y)\) in the XY-plane and vice-versa.

Some complex numbers such as \(2+4i,-2+3i,0+1i,2+0i,-5-2i\) and \(1-2i\) which correspond to the ordered pairs \((2,\,4)\), \((\,-\,2,\,3)\), \((0,\,1)\), \((2,\,0)\), \((\,-5,\,-2)\), and \((1,\,-\,2)\), respectively, have been represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively in the Fig 4.1.

The plane having a complex number assigned to each of its point is called the _complex plane_ or the _Argand plane_.

_Miscellaneous Examples_

**Example 7**: Find the conjugate of \(\overset{\cdot}{(3\!-\!2i)(2+3i)}\over(1+2i)(2-i)\).

**Solution** We have, \(\overset{\cdot}{(3\!-\!2i)(2+3i)}\over(1+2i)(2-i)\)

\[=\overset{\cdot}{6+9i-4i+6}=\overset{\cdot}{12+5i}\over 4+3i}\times\frac{4-3i}{4-3i}\]

\[=\overset{\cdot}{48\!-\!36i\!+\!20i\!+\!15}\over 16\!+\!9}\!=\!\frac{63\!-\!16i} {25}\overset{\cdot}{25}\overset{\cdot}{25}\overset{\cdot}{16}\over 25}i\]

Therefore, conjugate of \(\overset{\cdot}{(3\!-\!2i)(2+3i)}\over(1+2i)(2-i)\) is \(\overset{63}{25}\!+\!\frac{16}{25}i\).

**Example 8**: If \(x+iy=\overset{\cdot}{a+ib}\over a-ib\), prove that \(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\).

**Solution** We have,

\[x+iy\overset{\cdot}{(a+ib)(a+ib)}=\overset{\cdot}{a^{2}-b^{2}+2abi}\over a^{ 2}+b^{2}}=\overset{\cdot}{a^{2}-b^{2}}+\frac{2ab}{a^{2}+b^{2}}i\]

So that, \(x-iy=\overset{\cdot}{a^{2}-b^{2}}-\overset{2ab}{a^{2}+b^{2}}i\)

Therefore,

\[x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+iy).(x-iy)=\overset{\cdot}{(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}}+\frac{4a^{2}b^{ 2}}{(a^{2}+b^{2})^{2}}=\overset{\cdot}{(a^{2}+b^{2})^{2}}=1\]

### Summary

A number of the form \(a+ib,\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, is called a _complex number_, \(a\) is called the _real part_ and \(b\) is called the _imaginary_ part of the complex number.

Let \(z_{1}=a+ib\) and \(z_{2}=c+id.\) Then

1. \(z_{1}+z_{2}=(a+c)+i\) (\(b+d\))
2. \(z_{1}\)\(z_{2}\)\(=(ac-bd)+i\) (\(ad+bc\))

For any non-zero complex number \(z=a+ib\) (\(a\neq 0,\)\(b\neq 0\)), there exists the complex number \(\dfrac{a}{a^{2}+b^{2}}+i\dfrac{-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\), denoted by \(\dfrac{1}{z}\) or \(z^{-1}\), called the _multiplicative inverse_ of \(z\) such that \((a+ib)\)\(a^{2}+b^{2}+i\dfrac{-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\)\(=1+i0\)

\(=\)1

For any integer \(k,\)\(i^{ik}=1,\)\(i^{ik+1}=i,\)\(i^{ik+2}=-1,\)\(i^{ik+3}=-i\)

The conjugate of the complex number \(z=a+ib,\) denoted by \(\overline{z}\), is given by \(\overline{z}\) = \(a-ib.\)

### Historical Note

The fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number system was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian mathematician _Mahavira_ (850) who first stated this difficulty clearly. "He mentions in his work '_Ganitasara Sangraha_' as in the nature of things a negative (quantity) is not a square (quantity)', it has, therefore, no square root". _Bhaskara_, another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work _Bijaganita_, written in 1150. "There is no square root of a negative quantity, for it is not a square." _Cardan_ (1545) considered the problem of solving

\[x+y=10,\,xy=40.\]He obtained \(x=5+\sqrt{-15}\) and \(y=5-\sqrt{-15}\) as the solution of it, which was discarded by him by saying that these numbers are 'useless'. _Albert Girard_ (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that this will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation. _Euler_ was the first to introduce the symbol \(i\) for \(\sqrt{-1}\) and _W.R. Hamilton_ (about 1830) regarded the complex number \(a+ib\) as an ordered pair of real numbers \((a,b)\) thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use of the so called _'imaginary numbers'_.

## 5 Linear Inequalities

### Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied equations in one variable and two variables and also solved some statement problems by translating them in the form of equations. Now a natural question arises: 'Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the form of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less than 160 cm. Your classroom can occupy atmost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we get certain statements involving a sign '\(\times\) (less than), '\(>\)' (greater than), '\(\leq\)' (less than or equal) and \(\geq\) (greater than or equal) which are known as _inequalities_.

In this Chapter, we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology, etc.

### Inequalities

Let us consider the following situations:

(i) Ravi goes to market with \(\mathfrak{F}\,200\) to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The price of one packet of rice is \(\mathfrak{F}\,30\). If \(x\) denotes the number of packets of rice, which he buys, then the total amount spent by him is \(\mathfrak{F}\,30x\). Since, he has to buy rice in packets only, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of \(\mathfrak{F}\,200\). (Why?) Hence

\[30x<200\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad... \tag{1}\]

Clearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality.

(ii) Reshma has \(\mathfrak{F}\,120\) and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one register is \(\mathfrak{F}\,40\) and that of a pen is \(\mathfrak{F}\,20\). In this case, if \(x\) denotes the number of registers and \(y\), the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by her is \(\mathfrak{F}\,(40x\ +\ 20y)\) and we have

\[40x+20y\leq 120\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad... \tag{2}\]Since in this case the total amount spent may be upto \(\mathfrak{F}\) 120. Note that the statement (2) consists of two statements

\[\begin{array}{llll}&40x\,+\,20y\,<\,120&...\,\,(3)\\ \mbox{and}&40x\,+\,20y\,=\,120&...\,\,(4)\end{array}\]

Statement (3) is not an equation, i.e., it is an inequality while statement (4) is an equation.

**Definition 1** Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbol '\(<\)', '\(>\)', '\(\leq\)' or '\(\geq\)' form an _inequality_.

Statements such as (1), (2) and (3) above are inequalities.

\(3<5\); \(7>5\) are the examples of _numerical inequalities_ while

\(x<5\); \(y>2\); \(x\,\geq\,3\), \(y\,\leq\,4\) are some examples of _literal inequalities_.

\(3<5<7\) (read as 5 is greater than 3 and less than 7), \(3\,\leq\,x\,<\,5\) (read as \(\bar{x}\) is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 5) and \(2<y\,\leq\,4\) are the examples of _double inequalities_.

Some more examples of inequalities are:

\[\begin{array}{llll}&ax\,+\,b\,<\,0&...\,\,(5)\\ &ax\,+\,b\,>\,0&...\,\,(6)\\ &ax\,+\,b\,\leq\,0&...\,\,(7)\\ &ax\,+\,b\,\geq\,0&...\,\,(8)\\ &ax\,+\,by\,<\,c&...\,\,(9)\\ &ax\,+\,by\,>\,c&...\,\,(10)\\ &ax\,+\,by\,\leq\,c&...\,\,(11)\\ &ax\,+\,by\,\geq\,\,c&...\,\,(12)\\ &ax^{2}\,+\,bx\,+\,c\,\leq\,0&...\,\,(13)\\ &ax^{2}\,+\,bx\,+\,c\,>\,0&...\,\,(14)\end{array}\]

Inequalities (5), (6), (9), (10) and (14) are _strict inequalities_ while inequalities (7), (8), (11), (12), and (13) are _slack inequalities_. Inequalities from (5) to (8) are _linear inequalities_ in one variable \(x\) when \(a\neq 0\), while inequalities from (9) to (12) _are linear inequalities in two variables \(x\) and \(y\)_ when \(a\neq 0\), \(b\neq 0\).

Inequalities (13) and (14) are not linear _(in fact, these are quadratic inequalities in one variable \(x\) when \(a\neq 0\)_).

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of linear inequalities in one and two variables only.

### Algebraic Solutions of Linear Inequalities in One Variable and their Graphical Representation

Let us consider the inequality (1) of Section 6.2, viz, \(30x<200\)

Note that here \(x\) denotes the number of packets of rice.

Obviously, \(x\) cannot be a negative integer or a fraction. Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this inequality is \(30x\) and right hand side (RHS) is \(200\). Therefore, we have

For \(x=0\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(0\)) = \(0<200\) (R.H.S.), which is true.

For \(x=1\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(1\)) = \(30<200\) (R.H.S.), which is true.

For \(x=2\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(2\)) = \(60<200\), which is true.

For \(x=3\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(3\)) = \(90<200\), which is true.

For \(x=4\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(4\)) = \(120<200\), which is true.

For \(x=5\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(5\)) = \(150<200\), which is true.

For \(x=6\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(6\)) = \(180<200\), which is true.

For \(x=7\), L.H.S. = \(30\) (\(7\)) = \(210<200\), which is false.

In the above situation, we find that the values of \(x\), which makes the above inequality a true statement, are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. These values of \(x\), which make above inequality a true statement, are called _solutions_ of inequality and the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} is called its _solution set_.

_Thus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable which makes it a true statement._

We have found the solutions of the above inequality by _trial and error_ method which is not very efficient. Obviously, this method is time consuming and sometimes not feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities. Before that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and follow them as rules while solving the inequalities.

You will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules:

**Rule 1** Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an equation.

**Rule 2** Both sides of an equation may be multiplied (or divided) by the same non-zero number.

In the case of solving inequalities, we again follow the same rules except with a difference that in Rule 2, the sign of inequality is reversed (i.e., '\(<^{*}\)' becomes '\(>\)', \(\leq\)' becomes '\(\geq\)' and so on) whenever we multiply (or divide) both sides of an inequality by a negative number. It is evident from the facts that

\(3>2\) while - \(3<-2\),

- \(8<-7\) while (- \(8\)) (- \(2\)) > (- \(7\)) (- \(2\)), i.e., \(16>14\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:92]

**Example 3**: Solve \(4x+3<6x+7\).

**Solution** We have, \(4x+3<6x+7\)

or \(4x-6x<6x+4-6x\)

or \(-2x<4\) or \(x>-2\)

i.e., all the real numbers which are greater than -2, are the solutions of the given inequality. Hence, the solution set is (-2, \(\infty\)).

**Example 4**: Solve \(\frac{\cdot 5-2x}{3}\leq\frac{x}{6}-5\).

**Solution** We have

\[\frac{\cdot 5-2x}{3}\leq\frac{x}{6}-5\]

or \(2\)\((5-2x)\)\(\leq x-30\).

or \(10-4x\leq x-30\)

or \(-5x\leq-40\), i.e., \(x\geq 8\)

Thus, all real numbers \(x\) which are greater than or equal to 8 are the solutions of the given inequality, i.e., \(x\in[8,\,\infty)\).

**Example 5**: Solve \(7x+3<5x+9\). Show the graph of the solutions on number line.

**Solution** We have \(7x+3<5x+9\) or

\(2x<\).6 or \(x<3\)

The graphical representation of the solutions are given in Fig 5.1.

**Example 6**: Solve \(\frac{3x-4}{2}\geq\frac{x+1}{4}-1\). Show the graph of the solutions on number line.

**Solution** We have

\[\frac{3x-4}{2}\geq\frac{x+1}{4}-1\]

or \(\frac{\cdot 3x-4}{2}\geq\frac{x-3}{4}\)

or \(2\)\((3x-4)\geq(x-3)\)\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{or}&6x-8\geq x-3\\ \mbox{or}&5x\geq 5\ \ \mbox{or}\ \ x\geq 1\end{array}\]

The graphical representation of solutions is given in Fig 5.2.

**Example 7**.: The marks obtained by a student of Class XI in first and second terminal examination are 62 and 48, respectively. Find the minimum marks he should get in the annual examination to have an average of at least 60 marks.

**Solution** Let \(x\) be the marks obtained by student in the annual examination. Then

\[\begin{array}{l}\dot{62+48+x}\\ \dot{3}\geq 60\end{array}\]

or \[110+x\geq 180\]

or \[x\geq 70\]

Thus, the student must obtain a minimum of 70 marks to get an average of at least 60 marks.

**Example 8**.: Find all pairs of consecutive odd natural numbers, both of which are larger than 10, such that their sum is less than 40.

**Solution** Let \(x\) be the smaller of the two consecutive odd natural number, so that the other one is \(x+2\). Then, we should have

\[\begin{array}{ll}x>10&...\ (1)\\ \mbox{and}&x+(\ x+2)<40&...\ (2)\end{array}\]

Solving (2), we get

\[\begin{array}{ll}2x+2<40&\\ \mbox{i.e.,}&x<19&...\ (3)\end{array}\]

From (1) and (3), we get

\[10<x<19\]

Since \(x\) is an odd number, \(x\) can take the values 11, 13, 15, and 17. So, the required possible pairs will be

\[(11,13),(13,15),(15,17),(17,19)\]

The longest side of a triangle is 3 times the shortest side and the third side is 2 cm shorter than the longest side. If the perimeter of the triangle is at least 61 cm, find the minimum length of the shortest side.
26. A man wants to cut three lengths from a single piece of board of length 91cm. The second length is to be 3cm longer than the shortest and the third length is to be twice as long as the shortest. What are the possible lengths of the shortest board if the third piece is to be at least 5cm longer than the second?

If \(x\) is the length of the shortest board, then \(x\), \((x+3)\) and \(2x\) are the lengths of the second and third piece, respectively. Thus, \(x+(x+3)+2x\leq 91\) and \(2x\geq(x+3)+5\)].

### Miscellaneous Examples

**Example 9**: Solve \(-8\leq 5x-3<7\).

SolutionIn this case, we have two inequalities, \(-8\leq 5x-3\) and \(5x-3<7\), which we will solve simultaneously. We have \(-8\leq 5x-3<7\) or \(-5\leq 5x<10\) or \(-1\leq x<2\)

**Example 10**: Solve \(-5\leq\dfrac{5-3x}{2}\leq 8\)

SolutionWe have \(-5\leq 5-3x\leq 8\)

or \(-10\leq 5-3x\leq 16\) or \(5\geq x\geq-\dfrac{11}{3}\)

which can be written as \(\dfrac{-11}{3}\leq x\leq 5\)

**Example 11**: Solve the system of inequalities:

\(3x-7<5+x\)... (1)

\(11-5x\leq 1\)... (2)

and represent the solutions on the number line.

SolutionFrom inequality (1), we have

\(3x-7<5+x\) or \(x<6\)... (3)

Also, from inequality (2), we have

\(11-5x\leq 1\) or \(-5x\leq-10\) i.e., \(x\geq 2\)... (4)If we draw the graph of inequalities (3) and (4) on the number line, we see that the values of \(x\), which are common to both, are shown by bold line in Fig 5.3.

**Fig 5.3**

Thus, solution of the system are real numbers \(x\) lying between 2 and 6 including 2, i.e., \(2\leq x<6\)

**Example 12** In an experiment, a solution of hydrochloric acid is to be kept between \(30^{\circ}\) and \(35^{\circ}\) Celsius. What is the range of temperature in degree Fahrenheit if conversion formula is given by \(\mathrm{C}=\frac{5}{9}\) (\(\mathrm{F}-32\)), where C and F represent temperature in degree Celsius and degree Fahrenheit, respectively.

**Solution** It is given that \(30<\mathrm{C}<35\).

Putting \(\mathrm{C}=\frac{5}{9}\) (\(\mathrm{F}-32\)), we get

\(30<\frac{5}{9}\) (\(\mathrm{F}-32\)) \(<35\),

or \(\frac{9}{5}\) (\(30\)) (\(\mathrm{F}-32\)) \(<\) \(\frac{9}{5}\) (\(35\))

or \(54<(\mathrm{F}-32\)) \(<63\)

or \(86<\mathrm{F}<95\).

Thus, the required range of temperature is between \(86^{\circ}\) F and \(95^{\circ}\) F.

**Example 13** A manufacturer has 600 litres of a 12% solution of acid. How many litres of a 30% acid solution must be added to it so that acid content in the resulting mixture will be more than 15% but less than 18%?

**Solution** Let \(x\) litres of 30% acid solution is required to be added. Then

Total mixture \(=(x+600)\) litres

Therefore \(30\%\,x+12\%\) of \(600>15\%\) of \((x+600)\)

and \(30\%\,x+12\%\) of \(600<18\%\) of \((x+600)\)

or \(\frac{30x}{100}\) (\(600\)) \(>\frac{15}{100}\) (\(x+600\))

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:98]

How many litres of water will have to be added to 1125 litres of the 45% solution of acid so that the resulting mixture will contain more than 25% but less than 30% acid content?

Summary

Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbols \(<,>,\leq\) or \(\geq\) form an inequality.

Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from ) both sides of an inequality.

Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided ) by the same positive number. But when both sides are multiplied (or divided) by a negative number, then the inequality is reversed.

The values of \(x\), which make an inequality a true statement, are called _solutions of the inequality_.

To represent \(x<a\,(\text{or}\,x>a)\) on a number line, put a circle on the number \(a\) and dark line to the left (or right) of the number \(a\).

To represent \(x\leq a\,(\text{or}\,\dot{x}\geq a)\) on a number line, put a dark circle on the number \(a\) and dark the line to the left (or right) of the number \(x\).

## Permutations and Combinations

_Every body of discovery is mathematical in form because there is no other guidance we can have - DARWIN_

### _Introduction_

Suppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact, these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques.

### _Fundamental Principle of Counting_

Let us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore, there are 3 \(\times\) 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.

Let us name the three pants as P\({}_{{}_{1}}\), P\({}_{{}_{2}}\), P\({}_{{}_{3}}\) and the two shirts as S\({}_{{}_{1}}\), S\({}_{{}_{2}}\). Then, these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1.

Let us consider another problem of the same type.

Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes and 2 water bottles. In how many ways can she carry these items (choosing one each).

A school bag can be chosen in 2 different ways. After a school bag is chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3 different ways. Hence, there are \(2\times 3=6\) pairs of school bag and a tiffin box. For each of these pairs a water bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways.

Hence, there are \(6\times 2=12\) different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to school. If we name the 2 school bags as B\({}_{{}_{1}}\), B\({}_{{}_{2}}\), the three tiffin boxes as T\({}_{{}_{1}}\), T\({}_{{}_{2}}\), T\({}_{{}_{3}}\) and the two water bottles as W\({}_{{}_{1}}\), W\({}_{{}_{2}}\), these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2.

**Fig 6.2**In fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following principle known as the _fundamental principle of counting_, or, simply, the _multiplication principle_, which states that

_"If an event can occur in \(m\) different ways, following which another event can occur in \(n\) different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is \(m\times n\)."_

The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows:

'If an event can occur in \(m\) different ways, following which another event can occur in \(n\) different ways, following which a third event can occur in \(p\) different ways, then the total number of occurrence to 'the events in the given order is \(m\times n\times p\).'

In the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a pant

(ii) the event of choosing a shirt.

In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a school bag

(ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box

(iii) the event of choosing a water bottle.

Here, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of different ways of the occurence of the events in this chosen order.

**Example 1**: Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed.

**Solution**: There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places

by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3 different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the 4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is \(4\times 3\times 2\times 1=24\). Hence, the required number of words is 24.

NoteIf the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed? One can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words = 4 \(\times\) 4 \(\times\) 4 = 256.

**Example 2** Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other?

**Solution** There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places in succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags. Hence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals = 4\(\times\) 3 = 12.

**Example 3** How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated?

**Solution** There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places in succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit's place, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2 ways; following which the ten's place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required number of two digits even numbers is 2 \(\times\) 5, i.e., 10.

**Example 4** Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are available.

**Solution** A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags separately and then add the respective numbers.

There will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places in succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of ways is \(5\times 4=20\).

Similarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3 vacant places in succession by the 5 flags.

The number of ways is \(5\times 4\times 3=60\).

Continuing the same way, we find that

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{The number of 4 flag signals}=5\times 4\times 3\times 2=120\\ \mbox{and}\hskip 28.452756pt\mbox{the number of 5 flag signals}=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120\\ \mbox{Therefore,}\hskip 14.226378pt\mbox{the required no of signals}=20+60+120+120=320.\\ \end{array}\]

**EXERCISE 6.1**

1. How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 assuming that (i) repetition of the digits is allowed? (ii) repetition of the digits is not allowed?
2. How many 3-digit even numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if the digits can be repeated?

5. A coin is tossed 3 times and the outcomes are recorded. How many possible outcomes are there?
6. Given 5 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be generated if each signal requires the use of 2 flags, one below the other?

### Permutations

In Example 1 of the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS,..., etc. Here, in this list, each arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is important. Each arrangement is called a _permutation of 4 different letters taken all at a time_. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM, NMU, MUN, NUB,..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words \(=6\times 5\times 4=120\) (by using multiplication principle).

If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would be \(6\times 6\times 6=216\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:105]

**Example 5** Evaluate (i) 5! (ii) 7! (iii) 7! - 5!

**Solution** (i) 5! = 1 \(\times\) 2 \(\times\) 3 \(\times\) 4 \(\times\) 5 = 120

(ii) 7! = 1 \(\times\) 2 \(\times\) 3 \(\times\) 4 \(\times\) 5 \(\times\) 6 \(\times\)7 = 5040

and (iii) 7! - 5! = 5040 - 120 = 4920.

**Example 6** Compute (i) 7! 5! (ii) \(\frac{12!}{\left(10!\right)\left(2!\right)}\)

**Solution** (i) We have \(\frac{7!}{5!}=\frac{7\times 6\times 5!}{5!}=7\times 6=42\)

and (ii) \(\frac{12!}{\left(10!\right)\left(2!\right)}=\frac{12\times 11\times\left(10! \right)}{\left(10!\right)\times\left(2\right)}=6\times 11=66.\)

**Example 7** Evaluate \(\frac{n!}{r!\left(n-r\right)!}\), when \(n=5\), \(r=2\).

**Solution** We have to evaluate \(\frac{5!}{2!\left(5-2\right)!}=\frac{5!}{2!\times 3!}=\frac{5\times 4}{2}=10\).

**Example 8** If \(\frac{1}{8!}+\frac{1}{9!}=\frac{x}{10!}\), find \(x\).

**Solution** We have \(\frac{1}{8!}+\frac{1}{9!\times 8!}=\frac{x}{10\times 9\times 8!}\)

Therefore \(1+\frac{x}{9!}=\frac{x}{10\times 9}\) or \(\frac{10}{9}=\frac{x}{10\times 9}\)

So \(x=100\).

**EXERCISE 6.2**

**5.**: Evaluate \(\frac{n!}{\left(n-r\right)!}\), when

(i) \(n=6\), \(r=2\) (ii) \(n=9\), \(r=5\).

#### 6.3.3 Derivation of the formula for "P\({}_{r}\)

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{r}=\frac{n!}{\left(n-r\right)!}\), \(0\leq r\leq n\)

Let us now go back to the stage where we had determined the following formula:

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{r}=n\ (n-1)\ (n-2)\.\.\.\ \ (n\!-r+1)\)

Multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\left(n\!-r\right)\left(n\!-r-1\right)\), \(\cdot\), \(3\times 2\times 1\), we get

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{r}=\frac{n\left(n-1\right)\left(n-2\right)...\left(n-r+1\right)\left(n -r\right)\left(n-r-1\right)\), \(3\times 2\times 1}{\left(n-r\right)\left(n-r-1\right)\), \(3\times 2\times 1}=\frac{n!}{\left(n-r\right)!}\),

Thus

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{r}=\frac{n!}{\left(n-r\right)!}\), where \(0<r\leq n\)

This is a much more convenient expression for "P\({}_{r}\) than the previous one.

In particular, when \(r=n\), \({}^{n}\)P\({}_{n}=\frac{n!}{0!}=n!\)

Counting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we can have

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{n}=1=\frac{n!}{n!}=\frac{n!}{\left(n-0\right)!}\)... (1)

Therefore, the formula (1) is applicable for \(r=0\) also.

Thus

\({}^{n}\)P\({}_{r}=\frac{n!}{\left(n-r\right)!}\), \(0\leq r\leq n\).

**Theorem 2**: The number of permutations of \(n\) different objects taken \(r\) at a time, where repetition is allowed, is \(n^{r}\).

Proof is very similar to that of Theorem 1 and is left for the reader to arrive at.

Here, we are solving some of the problems of the pervious Section using the formula for "P\({}_{r}\) to illustrate its usefulness.

In Example 1, the required number of words \(={}^{4}\)P\({}_{4}=4!=24\). Here repetition is not allowed. If repetition is allowed, the required number of words would be \(4^{4}=256\).

The number of 3-letter words which can be formed by the letters of the word \(\cdot\)

\[\cdot\]

NUMBER \(={}^{6}\)P\({}_{3}=\frac{6!}{3!}=4\times 5\times 6=120\). Here, in this case also, the repetition is not allowed. If the repetition is allowed,the required number of words would be \(6^{3}=216\).

The number of ways in which a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman can be chosen from amongst a group of 12 persons assuming that one person can not hold more than one position, clearly \({}^{12}\)P\({}_{2}=\frac{12!}{10!}=11\times 12=\!132\).

#### 6.3.4 Permutations when all the objects are not distinct objects

Suppose we have to find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ROOT. In this case, the letters of the word are not all different. There are 2Os, which are of the same kind. Let us treat, temporarily, the 2Os as different, say, O\({}_{1}\) and O\({}_{2}\). The number of permutations of 4-different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 4!. Consider one of these permutations say, RO\({}_{1}\)O\({}_{2}\)T. Corresponding to this permutation,we have 2! permutations RO\({}_{1}\)O\({}_{2}\)T and RO\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{1}\)T which will be exactly the same permutation if O\({}_{1}\) and O\({}_{2}\) are not treated as different, i.e., if O\({}_{1}\) and O\({}_{2}\) are the same O at both places.

Therefore, the required number of permutations \(=\frac{4!}{2!}=3\times 4=\!12\).

Permutations when O\({}_{1}\), O\({}_{2}\) are different. Permutations when O\({}_{1}\), O\({}_{2}\) are the same O.

\[\cdot\]

\[\cdot\]
Let us now find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word INSTITUTE. In this case there are 9 letters, in which I appears 2 times and T appears 3 times.

Temporarily, let us treat these letters different and name them as I\({}_{1}\), I\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{3}\). The number of permutations of 9 different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 9!. Consider one such permutation, say, I\({}_{1}\) NT\({}_{1}\) SI\({}_{2}\) T\({}_{2}\) U E T\({}_{3}\). Here if I\({}_{1}\), I\({}_{2}\) are not same and T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{3}\) are not same, then I\({}_{1}\), I\({}_{2}\) can be arranged in 2! ways and T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{3}\) can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, \(2!\times 3!\) permutations will be just the same permutation corresponding to this chosen permutation I\({}_{1}\)NT\({}_{1}\)SI\({}_{2}\)T\({}_{2}\)UET\({}_{3}\). Hence, total number of different permutations will be \(\dfrac{9!}{2!3!}\)

We can state (without proof) the following theorems:

**Theorem 3**: The number of permutations of \(n\) objects, where \(p\) objects are of the same kind and rest are all different \(\dfrac{n!}{p!}\).

In fact, we have a more general theorem.

**Theorem 4**: The number of permutations of \(n\) objects, where \(p_{1}\) objects are of one kind, \(p_{2}\) are of second kind, \(...,p_{k}\) are of \(k^{\text{th}}\) kind and the rest, if any, are of different kind is \(\dfrac{n!}{p!\,p_{2}!...\,p_{k}!}\).

**Example 9**: Find the number of permutations of the letters of the word ALLAHABAD.

**Solution** Here, there are 9 objects (letters) of which there are 4A's, 2 L's and rest are all different.

Therefore, the required number of arrangements \(=\dfrac{9!}{4!2!}=\dfrac{5\times 6\times 7\times 8\times 9}{2}=7560\)

**Example 10**: How many 4-digit numbers can be formed by using the digits 1 to 9 if repetition of digits is not allowed?

**Solution** Here order matters for example 1234 and 1324 are two different numbers. Therefore, there will be as many 4 digit numbers as there are permutations of 9 different digits taken 4 at a time.

Therefore, the required 4 digit numbers \(=\)\({}^{9}\)P\({}_{4}=\dfrac{9!}{\left(9-4\right)!}=\dfrac{9!}{5!}=9\times 8\times 7\times 6=3024\).

**Example 11**: How many numbers lying between 100 and 1000 can be formed with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if the repetition of the digits is not allowed?

**Solution** Every number between 100 and 1000 is a 3-digit number. We, first, have to count the permutations of 6 digits taken 3 at a time. This number would be \({}^{6}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{3}\). But, these permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100's place. For example, 092, 042, \(\ldots\), etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the number of such numbers has to be subtracted from \({}^{6}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{3}\) to get the required number. To get the number of such numbers, we fix 0 at the 100's place and rearrange the remaining 5 digits taking 2 at a time. This number is \({}^{5}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{2}\). So

\[\cdot\]

The required number \[={}^{6}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{3}-{}^{5}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{2}=\frac{6!}{3!} -\frac{5!}{3!}\]

\[=4\times 5\times 6\ -\ 4\times 5=100\]

**Example 12**: Find the value of \(n\) such that

\[\text{(i)}\quad^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{5}=42\ ^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{3},\ n>4\qquad\qquad \qquad\text{(ii)}\quad^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{4}=\frac{5}{3}\,\ n>4\]

**Solution \(\cdot\)**: Given that

\[\cdot^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{5}=42\ ^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{3}\]

or \[n\ (n-1)\ (n-2)\ (n-3).(n-4)=42\ n(n-1)\ (n-2)\]

Since \(n>4\qquad\text{so}\ \ n(n-1)\ (n-2)\neq 0\)

Therefore, by dividing both sides by \(n(n-1)\ (n-2)\), we get

\[\begin{array}{l}(n-3\ (n-4)=42\\ \\ n^{2}\ -\ 7\ n-\ 30=0\\ \\ n^{2}-10n+3n-30\\ \\ n-10\ (n+3)=0\end{array}\]

or \[n+3=0\]

or \[n=-10\qquad\text{or}\quad n=-3\]

As \(n\) cannot be negative, so \(n=10\).

\[\text{(ii)}\quad\text{Given that}\ \cdot^{n}\!\!\mathrm{P}_{4}=\frac{5}{3}\]

Therefore \(3n\ (n-1)\ (n-2)\ (n-3)=5(n-1)\ (n-2)\ (n-3)\ (n-4)\)

or \(3n=5\ (n-4)\qquad\text{[as}\ (n-1)\ (n-2)\ (n-3)\neq 0,\ n>4]\)

or \(n=10\).

### Combinations

Let us now assume that there is a group of 3 lawn tennis players X, Y, Z. A team consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can we do so? Is the team of X and Y different from the team of Y and X? Here, order is not important. In fact, there are only 3 possible ways in which the team could be constructed.

These are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3).

Here, each selection is called a _combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time_. In a combination, the order is not important.

Now consider some more illustrations.

Twelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and Y with X will not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time.

Seven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different things taken 2 at a time.

Now, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of \(n\) different objects taken \(r\) at a time, denoted by \({}^{*}\)C.

Suppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here, AB and BA are the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., \({}^{4}\)C\({}_{2}\) = 6.

Corresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as 2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of permutations \(={}^{4}\)C\({}_{2}\times\)2!.

On the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at a time \(={}^{4}\)P\({}_{2}\).

Therefore

\({}^{4}\)P\({}_{2}\) = \({}^{4}\)C\({}_{2}\) x 2!

or

\({}^{4}\)P\({}_{2}\) = \({}^{4}\)C\({}_{2}\)

Now, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE, CDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these \({}^{5}\)C\({}_{3}\) combinations, there are 3! permutations, because, the three objects in each combination can be

\[\cdot\] \[=\,^{2}\mathrm{C}_{1}\times^{3}\mathrm{C}_{2}=\frac{2!}{!!\!!}\times\frac{3!}{2!\!!}=6\,.\]

**Example 19**: What is the number of ways of choosing 4 cards from a pack of 52 playing cards? In how many of these

1. four cards are of the same suit,
2. four cards belong to four different suits,
3. are face cards,
4. two are red cards and two are black cards,
5. cards are of the same colour?

SolutionThere will be as many ways of choosing 4 cards from 52 cards as there are combinations of 52 different things, taken 4 at a time. Therefore

The required number of ways \(=\,^{52}\mathrm{C}_{4}=\frac{52!}{4!\ 48!}=\frac{49\times 50\times 51\times 52 }{2\times 3\times 4}\)

1. There are four suits: diamond, club, spade, heart and there are 13 cards of each suit. Therefore, there are \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}\) ways of choosing 4 diamonds. Similarly, there are \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}\) ways of choosing 4 clubs, \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}\) ways of choosing 4 spades and \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}\) ways of choosing 4 hearts. Therefore The required number of ways \(=\,^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}+{}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}+{}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{4}+{}^{13} \mathrm{C}_{4}\).
2. There are13 cards in each suit. Therefore, there are \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}\) ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of diamond, \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}\) ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of clubs, \({}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}\) ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of spades. Hence, by multiplication principle, the required number of ways \(=\,^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}\times{}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}\times{}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1} \times{}^{13}\mathrm{C}_{1}=13^{4}\)
3. There are 12 face cards and 4 are to be selected out of these 12 cards. This can be done in \({}^{12}\mathrm{C}_{4}\) ways. Therefore, the required number of ways \(=\,\frac{12!}{4!\ 8!}=495\,.\)

**Example 22**: Find the number of words with or without meaning which can be made using all the letters of the word AGAIN. If these words are written as in a dictionary, what will be the 50th word?

**Solution** There are 5 letters in the word AGAIN, in which A appears 2 times. Therefore, the required number of words \(=\dfrac{\overset{\cdot}{5!}=60}{2!}\).

To get the number of words starting with A, we fix the letter A at the extreme left position, we then rearrange the remaining 4 letters taken all at a time. There will be as many arrangements of these 4 letters taken 4 at a time as there are permutations of 4 different things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with A \(=\ 4!=24\). Then, starting with G, the number of words \(=\dfrac{4!}{2!}=12\) as after placing G at the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N. Similarly, there are 12 words starting with the next letter I. Total number of words so far obtained \(=24+12+12=48\).

The 49th word is NAAGI. The 50th word is NAAGI.

**Example 23**: How many numbers greater than 1000000 can be formed by using the digits \(1,2,0,2,4,2,4\)?

**Solution** Since, 1000000 is a 7-digit number and the number of digits to be used is also 7. Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only. Also, the numbers have to be greater than 1000000, so they can begin either with 1, 2 or 4.

The number of numbers beginning with \(1=\dfrac{6!}{3!\ 2!}=\dfrac{4\times 5\times 6}{2}=60\), as when 1 is fixed at the extreme left position, the remaining digits to be rearranged will be \(0,2,2,2\), \(4,4\), in which there are \(3,\ 2s\) and \(2,\ 4s\).

Total numbers beginning with 2

\(=\dfrac{6!}{2!\ 2!}=\dfrac{3\times 4\times 5\times 6}{2}=180\)

and total numbers beginning with \(4=\dfrac{6!}{3!}=4\times 5\times 6=120\)Therefore, the required number of numbers \(=60+180+120=360\).

**Alternative Method**

The number of 7-digit arrangements, clearly, \(\dfrac{7!}{3!\ 2!}=420\). But, this will include those numbers also, which have 0 at the extreme left position. The number of such arrangements \(\dfrac{6!}{3!\ 2!}\) (by fixing 0 at the extreme left position) = 60.

Therefore, the required number of numbers \(=420-60=360\).

NoteIf one or more than one digits given in the list is repeated, it will be understood that in any number, the digits can be used as many times as is given in the list, e.g., in the above example 1 and 0 can be used only once whereas 2 and 4 can be used 3 times and 2 times, respectively.

Example 24: In how many ways can 5 girls and 3 boys be seated in a row so that no two boys are together?

SolutionLet us first seat the 5 girls. This can be done in 5! ways. For each such arrangement, the three boys can be seated only at the cross marked places.

There are 6 cross marked places and the three boys can be seated in \({}^{6}\!P_{{}_{3}}\) ways. Hence, by multiplication principle, the total number of ways

\[=5!\times{}^{6}\!P_{{}_{3}}=5!\times\dfrac{6!}{3!}\] \[=4\times 5\times 2\times 3\times 4\times 5\times 6\ =14400.\]

The number of combinations of \(n\) different things taken \(r\) at a time, denoted by \({}^{\text{\tiny{n}}}\)C\({}_{r}\), is given by \({}^{\text{\tiny{n}}}\)C\({}_{r}\) = \(\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\), \(0\leq r\leq n\).

### Historical Note

The concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to the advent of Jainism in India and perhaps even earlier. The credit, however, goes to the Jains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics, under the name _Vikalpa_.

Among the Jains, _Mahavira_, (around 850) is perhaps the world's first mathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and combinations.

In the 6th century B.C., _Sushruta_, in his medicinal work, _Sushruta Samhita_, asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. _Pingala_, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C., gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work _Chhanda Sutra_. _Bhaskaracharya_ (born1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and combinations under the name _Anka Pasha_ in his famous work _Lilavati_. In addition to the general formulae for "C, and "P, already provided by _Mahavira_, _Bhaskaracharya_ gives several important theorems and results concerning the subject.

Outside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its humble beginnings in China in the famous book I-King (Book of changes). It is difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.

Some Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and combinations in studying astronomy. _Rabbi ben Ezra,_ for instance, determined the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that _Rabbi ben Ezra_ did not know the formula for "C". However, he was aware that "C" = "C" ="C" ="n-" for specific values \(n\) and \(r\). In 1321, _Levi Ben Gerson_, another Hebrew writer came up with the formulae for "P", "P" _and the general formula for "C"._

The first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, _Jacob Bernoulli_ (1654 - 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:127]

Now, if we want to find the expansion of \((2x+3y)^{12}\), we are first required to get the row for index 12. This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle till index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become more difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers.

We thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for any power without writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle, that come before the row of the desired index.

For this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite the numbers in the Pascal's triangle. We know that \(\ \ {}^{n}\mathrm{C}_{r}\ =\ \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\,\ 0\leq\ r\ \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\scalebox{0.7 }{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}}n\) and \(n\) is a non-negative integer. Also, \(\ \ {}^{n}\mathrm{C}_{0}=1=\ ^{n}\mathrm{C}_{n}\).

The Pascal's triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3)

Observing this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal's triangle for any index without writing the earlier rows. For example, for the index 7 the row would be

\(\ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{0}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{1}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{2}\ \ {}^{7} \mathrm{C}_{3}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{4}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{5}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{6}\ \ {}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{7}.\)

Thus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have

\((a+b)^{7}={}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{0}\ a^{7}+7\mathrm{C}_{1}a^{6}b+{}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{2 }a^{3}b^{2}+{}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{3}a^{4}b^{3}+7\mathrm{C}_{4}a^{3}b^{4}+{}^{7} \mathrm{C}_{5}a^{2}b^{5}+{}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{6}ab^{6}+{}^{7}\mathrm{C}_{7}b^{7}\)

An expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say \(n\) can now be visualised using these observations. We are now in a position to write the expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index.

**Example 4**: Using binomial theorem, prove that \(6^{n}\)-\(5n\) always leaves remainder \(1\) when divided by \(25\).

SolutionFor two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) if we can find numbers \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a=bq+r\), then we say that \(b\) divides \(a\) with \(q\) as quotient and \(r\) as remainder. Thus, in order to show that \(6^{n}-5n\) leaves remainder \(1\) when divided by \(25\), we prove that \(6^{n}-5n=25k+1\), where \(k\) is some natural number.

We have

\[(1+a)^{n}={}^{n}{\rm C}_{0}+{}^{n}{\rm C}_{1}a+{}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}a^{2}+...+{}^ {n}{\rm C}_{n}a^{n}\]

For \(a=5\), we get

\[(1+5)^{n}={}^{n}{\rm C}_{0}+{}^{n}{\rm C}_{1}5+{}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}5^{2}+...+{}^ {n}{\rm C}_{n}{}^{5}{}^{n}\]

i.e. \[(6)^{n}=1+5n+5^{2}.{}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}+5^{3}.{}^{n}{\rm C}_{3}+...+5^{n}\]

i.e. \[6^{n}-5n=1+5^{2}\,({}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}+{}^{n}{\rm C}_{3}5+...+5^{n-2})\]

or \[6^{n}-5n=1+25\,({}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}+5\,.{}^{n}{\rm C}_{3}+...+5^{n-2})\]

or \[6^{n}-5n=25k+1\quad\mbox{ where }k={}^{n}{\rm C}_{2}+5\,.{}^{n}{\rm C}_{3}+...+5^{n-2}.\]

This shows that when divided by \(25\), \(6^{n}-5n\) leaves remainder \(1\).

### Historical Note

The ancient Indian mathematicians knew about the coefficients in the expansions of \((x+y)^{n}\), \(0\leq n\leq 7\). The arrangement of these coefficients was in the form of a diagram called _Meru-Prastara_, provided by Pingla in his book _Chhanda shastra_ (200B.C.). This triangular arrangement is also found in the work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of \((a+b)^{n}\), for \(n=1,2\)...,7 and Oughtred (1631) gave them for \(n=1\), \(2,\)..., \(10\). The arithmetic triangle, popularly known as _Pascal's triangle_ and similar to the _Meru-Prastara_ of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) in 1665.

The present form of the binomial theorem for integral values of \(n\) appeared in _Trate du triange arithmetic_, written by Pascal and published posthumously in 1665.

## 8 Introduction

In mathematics, the word, "_sequence_" is used in much the same way as it is in ordinary English. When we say that a collection of objects is listed in a sequence, we usually mean that the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an identified first member, second member, third member and so on. For example, population of human beings or bacteria at different times form a sequence. The amount of money, deposited in a bank, over a number of years form a sequence. Depreciated values of certain commodity occur in a sequence. Sequences have important applications in several spheres of human activities,

Sequences, following specific patterns are called _progressions_. In previous class, we have studied about _arithmetic progression_ (A.P). In this Chapter, besides discussing more about A.P.; _arithmetic mean, geometric mean, relationship between A.M. and GM., special series in forms of sum to n terms of consecutive natural numbers, sum to n terms of squares of natural numbers and sum to n terms of cubes of natural numbers_ will also be studied.

### Sequences

Let us consider the following examples:

Assume that there is a generation gap of 30 years, we are asked to find the number of ancestors, i.e., parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. that a person might have over 300 years.

Here, the total number of generations = \(\frac{300}{30}\)=10

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:136]

In the sequence of primes 2,3,5,7,..., we find that there is no formula for the \(n^{\text{th}}\) prime. Such sequence can only be described by verbal description.

In every sequence, we should not expect that its terms will necessarily be given by a specific formula. However, we expect a theoretical scheme or a rule for generating the terms \(a_{{}_{1}}\), \(a_{{}_{2}}\),\(a_{{}_{3}}\),...,\(a_{{}_{n}}\),... in succession.

In view of the above, _a sequence can be regarded as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers or some subset of it. Sometimes, we use the functional notation a(n) for \(a_{\eta}\)_.

### Series

Let \(a_{{}_{1}}\), \(a_{{}_{2}}\),\(a_{{}_{3}}\),...,\(a_{{}_{n}}\), be a given sequence. Then, the expression

\[a_{{}_{1}}+a_{{}_{2}}+a_{{}_{3}}+,\ldots+a_{{}_{n}}+...\]

is called the _series associated with the given sequence_.The series is finite or infinite according as the given sequence is finite or infinite. Series are often represented in compact form, called _sigma notation_, using the Greek letter \(\sum\) (sigma) as means of indicating the summation involved. Thus, the series \(a_{{}_{1}}+a_{{}_{2}}+a_{{}_{3}}+...+a_{{}_{n}}\) is abbreviated as \(\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}\).

_Remark_. When the series is used, it refers to the indicated sum not to the sum itself. For example, \(1+3+5+7\) is a finite series with four terms. When we use the phrase "_sum of a series_," we will mean the number that results from adding the terms, the sum of the series is 16.

We now consider some examples.

**Example 1**: Write the first three terms in each of the following sequences defined by the following:

\[\text{(i)}\quad a_{n}\equiv 2n+5,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(ii)}\quad a_{n}= \frac{n-3}{4}\,.\]

**Solution**: (i) Here \(a_{n}=2n+5\)

Substituting \(n=1\), \(2\), \(3\), we get

\[a_{{}_{1}}=2(1)+5=7,\,a_{{}_{2}}=9,\,a_{{}_{3}}=11\]

Therefore, the required terms are \(7\), \(9\) and \(11\).

\[\text{(ii)}\quad\text{Here }a_{n}=\frac{n-3}{4}\,.\,\,\text{Thus, }\,\,a_{1}=\frac{1-3}{4}=-\frac{1}{2},\,a_{2}=-\frac{1}{4},\,a_{3}=0\]Hence, the first three terms are \(\cdot\dfrac{1}{2}\,,-\dfrac{1}{4}\) and \(0\).

**Example 2**: What is the \(20^{\text{th}}\) term of the sequence defined by

\(a_{n}=(n-1)\ (2-n)\ (3+n)\)?

**Solution** Putting \(n=20\), we obtain

\(a_{20}=(20-1)\ (2-20)\ (3+20)\)

\(=\ 19\times(-18)\times(23)=-\ 7866\).

**Example 3**: Let the sequence \(a_{n}\) be defined as follows:

\(a_{1}=1\), \(a_{n}=a_{n-1}+2\) for \(n\geq 2\).

Find first five terms and write corresponding series.

**Solution** We have

\(a_{1}=1\), \(a_{2}=a_{1}+2=1+2=3\), \(a_{3}=a_{2}+2=3+2=5\),

\(a_{4}=a_{3}+2=5+2=7\), \(a_{5}=a_{4}+2=7+2=9\).

Hence, the first five terms of the sequence are \(1,3,5,7\) and \(9\). The corresponding series is \(1+3+5+7+9+...\)

Write the first five terms of each of the sequences in Exercises 1 to 6 whose \(n^{\text{th}}\) terms are:

\(a_{n}=n\ (n+2)\)\(a_{n}=\dfrac{n}{n+1}\)\(a_{n}=2^{n}\)

\(a_{n}=\dfrac{2n-3}{6}\)\(a_{n}=(-1)^{n-1}\ 5^{n+1}\)\(a_{n}=n\dfrac{n^{2}+5}{4}\).

Find the indicated terms in each of the sequences in Exercises 7 to 10 whose \(n^{\text{th}}\) terms are:

\(a_{n}=4n-3\); \(a_{17}\), \(a_{24}\)\(a_{n}=\dfrac{n^{2}}{2^{n}};a_{7}\)

\(a_{n}=(-1)^{n-1}n^{3}\); \(a_{9}\)\(a_{n}=(-1)^{n-1}n^{3}\); \(a_{9}\)\(a_{n}=\dfrac{n(n-2)}{n+3};a_{20}\).

Write the first five terms of each of the sequences in Exercises 11 to 13 and obtain the corresponding series:

11. \(a_{{}_{1}}=3\), \(a_{{}_{n}}=3a_{{}_{n-1}}+2\) for all \(n>1\) 12. \(a_{{}_{1}}=-1\), \(a_{{}_{n}}=\dfrac{a_{{}_{n-1}}}{n}\), \(n\geq 2\)
13. \(a_{{}_{1}}=a_{{}_{2}}=2\), \(a_{{}_{n}}=a_{{}_{n-1}}-1\), \(n>2\)
14. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by

\(1=a_{{}_{1}}=a_{{}_{2}}\) and \(a_{{}_{n}}=a_{{}_{n-1}}+a_{{}_{n-2}}\), \(n>2\).

Find \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{n+1}}}{a_{{}_{n}}}\), for \(n=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\)

### Geometric Progression (G. P.)

Let us consider the following sequences:

\(\text{(i) 2,4,8,16,..., (ii) }\dfrac{1}{9}\dfrac{-1}{27}\dfrac{1}{81}\dfrac{-1}{243}\) (iii) 01; 0001, 000001,...\(\text{(iii) 01; 00001, 000001,...}\)

In each of these sequences, how their terms progress? We note that each term, except the first progresses in a definite order.

In (i), we have \(a_{{}_{1}}=2\), \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{2}}}{a_{{}_{1}}}=2\), \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{3}}}{a_{{}_{2}}}=2\) and so on.

In (ii), we observe, \(a_{{}_{1}}=\dfrac{1}{9}\), \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{2}}}{a_{{}_{1}}}=\dfrac{1}{3}\), \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{3}}}{a_{{}_{2}}}=\dfrac{1}{3}\), \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{4}}}{a_{{}_{3}}}=\dfrac{1}{3}\) and so on.

Similarly, state how do the terms in (iii) progress? It is observed that in each case, every term except the first term bears a constant ratio to the term immediately preceding it. In (i), this constant ratio is \(2\); in (ii), it is \(-\dfrac{1}{3}\) and in (iii), the constant ratio is \(0.01\). Such sequences are called _geometric sequence_ or _geometric progression_ abbreviated as GP.

A sequence \(a_{{}_{1}},a_{{}_{2}}\), \(a_{{}_{3}}\),..., \(a_{{}_{n}}\),... is called _geometric progression_, if each term is non-zero and \(\dfrac{a_{{}_{k}+1}}{a_{{}_{k}}}=r\) (constant), for \(k\geq 1\).

By letting \(a_{{}_{1}}=a\), we obtain a geometric progression, \(a\), \(ar\), \(ar^{2}\), \(ar^{3}\),..., where \(a\) is called the _first term_ and \(r\) is called the _common ratio_ of the G.P. Common ratio in geometric progression (i), (ii) and (iii) above are \(2\), \(-\dfrac{1}{3}\) and \(0.01\), respectively.

As in case of arithmetic progression, the problem of finding the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term or sum of \(n\) terms of a geometric progression containing a large number of terms would be difficult without the use of the formulae which we shall develop in the next Section. We shall use the following notations with these formulae:

\(a=\) the first term, \(r=\) the common ratio, \(l=\) the last term,

\(n=\) the numbers of terms,

\(\text{S}_{n}=\) the sum of first \(n\) terms.

#### 8.4.1 General term of a G.P

Let us consider a G.P. with first non-zero term '\(a\)' and common ratio '\(r\)'. Write a few terms of it. The second term is obtained by multiplying \(a\) by \(r\), thus \(a_{{}_{2}}=ar\). Similarly, third term is obtained by multiplying \(a_{{}_{2}}\) by \(r\). Thus, \(a_{{}_{3}}=a_{{}_{2}}r=ar^{2}\), and so on.

We write below these and few more terms.

\(1^{\text{st}}\) term \(=a_{{}_{1}}=a=ar^{{}_{1}-1}\), \(2^{\text{nd}}\) term \(=a_{{}_{2}}=ar=ar^{{}_{2}-1}\), \(3^{\text{rd}}\) term \(=a_{{}_{3}}=ar^{{}_{2}}=ar^{{}_{3}-1}\)

\(4^{\text{th}}\) term \(=a_{{}_{4}}=ar^{{}_{3}}=ar^{{}_{4}-1}\), \(5^{\text{th}}\) term \(=a_{{}_{5}}=ar^{{}_{4}}=ar^{{}_{5}-1}\)

Do you see a pattern? What will be \(16^{\text{th}}\) term?

\(a_{{}_{16}}=ar^{{}_{1}6-1}=ar^{{}_{1}5}\)

Therefore, the pattern suggests that the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of a G.P. is given by

\(a_{{}_{n}}=ar^{{}_{n}-1}\).

Thus, \(a\), G.P. can be written as \(a,ar,ar^{{}_{5}},ar^{{}_{2}},ar^{{}_{3}},...a^{{}_{n}-1},a\), \(ar\), \(ar^{{}_{2}},...,ar^{{}_{n}-1}...\);according as G.P. is _finite_ or _infinite_, respectively.

The series \(a+ar+ar^{{}_{2}}+...+ar^{{}_{n}-1}\) or \(a+ar+ar^{{}_{2}}+...+ar^{{}_{n}-1}+...\)are called _finite_ or _infinite geometric series_, respectively.

#### 8.4.2 Sum to n terms of a G.P

Let the first term of a G.P. be \(a\) and the common ratio be \(r\). Let us denote by \(\text{S}_{n}\) the sum to first \(n\) terms of G.P. Then

\(\text{S}_{n}=a+ar+ar^{{}_{2}}+...+ar^{{}_{n-1}}\)... (1)

\(\text{Case 1}\) If \(r=1\), we have \(\text{S}_{n}=a+a+a+...+a\) (\(n\) terms) \(=na\)

\(\text{Case 2}\) If \(r\neq 1\), multiplying (1) by \(r\), we have

\(r\text{S}_{n}=ar+ar^{{}_{2}}+ar^{{}_{3}}+...+ar^{{}_{n}}\)... (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1), we get \((1-r)\)\(\text{S}_{n}=a-ar^{{}_{n}}=a(1-r^{n})\)

\(\text{This gives}\) or \(\text{S}_{n}=\frac{a(r^{n}-1)}{r-1}\)

**Example 4**: Find the \(10^{\text{th}}\) and \(n^{\text{th}}\) terms of the G.P. 5, 25,125,....

**Solution**: Here \(a=5\) and \(r=5\). Thus, \(a_{{}_{10}}=5(5)^{{}_{10}-1}=5(5)^{{}_{9}}=5^{{}_{10}}\) and \(a_{{}_{n}}=ar^{{}_{n-1}}=5(5)^{{}_{n-1}}=5^{{}_{n}}\).

**Example 5** Which term of the G.P., 2,8,32,... up to \(n\) terms is 131072?

**Solution** Let \(131072\) be the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of the given G.P. Here \(a=2\) and \(r=4\).

Therefore \(131072=a_{n}=2(4)^{n-1}\) or \(65536=4^{n-1}\)

This gives \(4^{8}=4^{n-1}\).

So that \(n-1=8\), i.e., \(n=9\). Hence, \(131072\) is the \(9^{\text{th}}\) term of the G.P.

**Example 6** In a G.P., the \(3^{\text{rd}}\) term is 24 and the \(6^{\text{th}}\) term is 192.Find the \(10^{\text{th}}\) term.

**Solution** Here, \(a_{3}=ar^{2}=24\)... (1)

and \(a_{6}=ar^{5}=192\)... (2)

Dividing (2) by (1), we get \(r=2\). Substituting \(r=2\) in (1), we get \(a=6\).

Hence \(a_{10}=6\) (2)\({}^{9}=3072\).

**Example 7** Find the sum of first \(n\) terms and the sum of first \(5\) terms of the geometric series \(1+\dfrac{2}{3}+\dfrac{4}{9}+...\)

**Solution** Here \(a=1\) and \(r=\dfrac{2}{3}\). Therefore

In particular, \(S_{5}=3\times\dfrac{211}{243}=\dfrac{211}{81}\).

**Example 8** How many terms of the G.P. \(3,\dfrac{2}{2},\dfrac{3}{4},...\) are needed to give the sum \(\dfrac{3069}{512}\).

**Solution** Let \(n\) be the number of terms needed. Given that \(a=3\), \(r=\dfrac{1}{2}\) and \(S_{n}=\dfrac{3069}{512}\)

Since \(S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}\)Therefore

\[\cdot\]

or

\[\frac{\overset{\cdot}{3069}}{3072}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\]

or

\[\cdot\]

or

\[\frac{1}{2^{n}}=1-\frac{3069}{3072}=\frac{3}{3072}=\frac{1}{1024}\]

or

\[2^{n}=1024=2^{10},\text{ which gives }n=10.\]

**Example 9**: The sum of first three terms of a GP. is \(\frac{13}{12}\) and their product is \(-1\).

Find the common ratio and the terms.

**Solution**: Let \(\frac{a}{r}\), \(a\), \(ar\) be the first three terms of the GP. Then

\[\cdot\]

and

\[\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)\left(a\right)\left(ar\right)=-1\]

From (2), we get \(a^{3}=-1\), i.e., \(a=-1\) (considering only real roots)

Substituting \(a=-1\) in (1), we have

\[-\frac{1}{r}-1-r=\frac{13}{12}\text{ or }12r^{2}\geq 25r+12=0.\]

This is a quadratic in \(r\); solving, we get \(r=-\frac{3}{4}\) or \(-\frac{4}{3}\).

Thus, the three terms of GP. are \(:\frac{4}{3},-1,\frac{3}{4}\) for \(r=\frac{-3}{4}\) and \(\frac{3}{4},-1,\)\(\frac{4}{3}\) for \(r=\frac{-4}{3}\),

**Example10**: Find the sum of the sequence 7, 77, 777, 7777,... to \(n\) terms.

**Solution**: This is not a GP., however, we can relate it to a GP. by writing the terms as

\[\text{S}_{n}=7+77+777+7777+...\text{ to }n\text{ terms}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:143]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:144]

Solving (3) and (5), we obtain

\[a=4,\,b=16\text{ or }a=16,\,b=4\]

Thus, the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are \(4,\,16\text{ or }16,\,4\) respectively.

_Miscellaneous Examples_

**Example 14**: If \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\) and \(p\) are different real numbers such that

\((a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2})p^{2}-2(ab+bc+cd)\,p+(b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2})\leq 0\), then show that \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are in G.P.

SolutionGiven that

\((a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2})\,p^{2}-2\,\,(ab+bc+cd)\,p+(b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2})\leq 0\)

But L.H.S.

\(=(a^{2}p^{2}-2abp+b^{2})+(b^{2}p^{2}-2bcp+c^{2})+(c^{2}p^{2}-2cdp+d^{2})\),

which gives \((ap-b)^{2}+(bp-c)^{2}+(cp-d)^{2}\geq 0\)

Since the sum of squares of real numbers is non negative, therefore, from (1) and (2), we have, \((ap-b)^{2}+(bp-c)^{2}+(cp-d)^{2}=0\)

or

\(ap-b=0\), \(bp-c=0\), \(cp-d=0\)

This implies that \(\frac{b}{a}=\frac{c}{b}=\frac{d}{c}=p\)

Hence \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are in G.P.

### Summary

* By a _sequence_, we mean an arrangement of number in definite order according to some rule. Also, we define a sequence as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers or some subsets of the type {1, 2, 3,....\(k\)}. A sequence containing a finite number of terms is called a _finite sequence_. A sequence is called _infinite_ if it is not a finite sequence.
* Let \(a_{{}_{1}}\), \(a_{{}_{2}}\), \(a_{{}_{3}}\),... be the sequence, then the sum expressed as \(a_{{}_{1}}+a_{{}_{2}}+a_{{}_{3}}+...\) is called _series_. A series is called _finite series_ if it has got finite number of terms.
* A sequence is said to be a _geometric progression_ or _G.P._, if the ratio of any term to its preceding term is same throughout. This constant factor is called the _common ratio_. Usually, we denote the first term of a G.P. by \(a\) and its common ratio by \(r\). The general or the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of G.P. is given by \(a_{{}_{n}}=a^{n^{\alpha-1}}\). The sum \(\text{S}_{{}_{n}}\) of the first \(n\) terms of G.P. is given by.
* The geometric mean (G.M.) of any two positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is given by.

### Historical Note

Evidence is found that Babylonians, some 4000 years ago, knew of arithmetic and geometric sequences. According to Boethius (510), arithmetic and geometric sequences were known to early Greek writers. Among the Indian mathematician, Aryabhatta (476) was the first to give the formula for the sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers in his famous work Aryabhatiyam, written around 499. He also gave the formula for finding the sum to \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting with \(p^{\text{th}}\) term. Noted Indian mathematicians Brahmgupta(598), Mahavira (850) and Bhaskara (1114-1185) also considered the sum of squares and cubes. Another specific type of sequence having important applications in mathematics, called _Fibonacci sequence_, was discovered by Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1250). Seventeenth century witnessed the classification of series into specific forms. In 1671 James Gregory used the term infinite series in connection with infinite sequence. It was only through the rigorous development of algebraic and set theoretic tools that the concepts related to sequence and series could be formulated suitably.

### 9.1 Introduction

We are familiar with two-dimensional _coordinate geometry_ from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of _algebra_ and _geometry_. A systematic study of geometry by the use of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes, in his book 'La Geometry, published in 1637. This book introduced the notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical methods into the study of geometry. The resulting combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as _analytical geometry_. In the earlier classes, we initiated the study of coordinate geometry, where we studied about coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the basics of coordinate geometry.

Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To recapitulate, the location of the points (6, - 4) and (3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1.

We may note that the point (6, - 4) is at 6 units distance from the \(y\)-axis measured along the positive \(x\)-axis and at 4 units distance from the \(x\)-axis measured along the negative \(y\)-axis. Similarly, the point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the \(y\)-axis measured along the positive \(x\)-axis and has zero distance from the \(x\)-axis.

We also studied there following important formulae:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:152]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:153]

From equations (1) and (2), we have

\[m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}.\]

Case II When angle \(\theta\) is obtuse:

In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have

\[\angle\text{MPQ}=180^{\circ}-\ \theta.\]

Therefore, \(\theta=180^{\circ}-\angle\text{MPQ}\).

Now, slope of the line \(l\)

\[\begin{array}{l}m=\tan\ \theta\\ =\tan\ (\ 180^{\circ}-\angle\text{MPQ})=-\tan\ \angle\text{MPQ}\\ \_Hence, two non vertical lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\) are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal._

**If the lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\) are perpendicular** (Fig 9.5), then \(\beta=\alpha+90^{\circ}\).

Therefore, \(\tan\ \beta=\tan\ (\alpha+90^{\circ})\)

\[= -\cot\ \alpha=-\frac{1}{\tan\alpha}\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\text{i.e.,}\]

\[m_{2}=-\frac{1}{m_{1}}\quad\text{or}\qquad m_{1}\ \ m_{2}\ =-1\]

Conversely, if \(m_{1}\ \ m_{2}\ =\ -1\), i.e., \(\tan\ \alpha\ \tan\ \beta=-1\).

Then \(\tan\ \alpha=-\cot\ \beta=\tan\ (\beta+90^{\circ})\) or \(\tan\ (\beta-90^{\circ})\)

Therefore, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) differ by \(90^{\circ}\).

Thus, lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\) are perpendicular to each other.

Hence, _two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,_

\[\cdot\] \[m_{2}=-\frac{1}{m_{1}}\ \text{or},\ \ m_{1}\ m_{2}=-1.\]

Let us consider the following example.

**Example 1**: Find the slope of the lines:

1. Passing through the points \((3,-2)\) and \((-1,4)\),
2. Passing through the points \((3,-2)\) and \((7,-2)\),
3. Passing through the points \((3,-2)\) and \((3,4)\),
4. Making inclination of \(60^{\circ}\) with the positive direction of \(x\)-axis.

**Solution**:
1. The slope of the line through \((3,-2)\) and \((-1,4)\) is

\[m=\frac{4-(-2)}{-1-3}=\frac{6}{-4}=-\frac{3}{2}\ \.\] 2. The slope of the line through the points \((3,-2)\) and \((7,-2)\) is

\[\cdot\] \[m=\frac{-2-(-2)}{7-3}=\frac{0}{4}=0\.\]
3. The slope of the line through the points \((3,-2)\) and \((3,4)\) is \[m=\frac{4-(-2)}{3-3}=\frac{6}{0}\,,\] (4) Here inclination of the line \(\alpha=60^{\circ}\). Therefore, slope of the line is \(m=\tan\,60^{\circ}=\sqrt{3}\).

#### Angle between two lines

When we think about more than one line in a plane, then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.

Let \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) be two non-vertical lines with slopes \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\), respectively. If \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) are the inclinations of lines \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\), respectively. Then

\[m_{1}=\tan\alpha_{1}\text{ and }m_{2}=\tan\alpha_{2}\,.\]

We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is \(180^{\circ}\). Let \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) be the adjacent angles between the lines \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) (Fig 9). Then

\[\theta=\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}\text{ and }\alpha_{1}\text{ and }\alpha_{2}\text{ }\neq 90^{\circ}\,.\]

Therefore \(\tan\,\theta=\tan\,(\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1})=\frac{\tan\alpha_{2}-\tan\alpha_{1 }}{1+\tan\alpha_{1}\tan\alpha_{2}}=\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}\) (as \(1+m_{1}m_{2}\neq 0\)) and \(\phi=180^{\circ}-\theta\) so that

\[\tan\,\phi=\tan\,(180^{\circ}=\theta)=-\tan\theta=-\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m _{2}}\,,\,\text{as }1+m_{1}m_{2}\neq 0\]

Now, there arise two cases:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:157]

Therefore \(m=3\) or \(m=-\dfrac{1}{3}\). Hence, slope of the other line is \(\cdot\). 3 or \(-\dfrac{1}{3}\). Fig 9.7 explains the reason of two answers.

**Example 3** Line through the points (\(-2\), \(6\)) and (\(4\), \(8\)) is perpendicular to the line through the points (\(8\), \(12\)) and (\(x\), \(24\)). Find the value of \(x\).

**Solution** Slope of the line through the points (\(-2\), \(6\)) and (\(4\), \(8\)) is

\(m_{1}=\dfrac{8-6}{4-(-2)}=\dfrac{2}{6}=\dfrac{1}{3}\)

Slope of the line through the points (\(8\), \(12\)) and (\(x\), \(24\)) is

\(m_{2}=\dfrac{24-12}{x-8}=\dfrac{12}{x-8}\)

Since two lines are perpendicular, \(m_{1}\)\(m_{2}=-1\), which gives

\(\dfrac{1}{3}\times\dfrac{12}{x-8}=\dfrac{1}{1}\) or \(x=4\).

### Various Forms of the Equation of a Line

We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:

How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line. Suppose P (\(x\), \(y\)) is an arbitrary point in the XY-plane and L is the given line. For the equation of L, we wish to construct a _statement_ or _condition_ for the point P that is true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic equation involving the variables \(x\) and \(y\). Now, we will discuss the equation of a line under different conditions.

#### 9.3.1 Horizontal and vertical lines

If a horizontal line L is at a distance \(a\) from the \(x\)-axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either \(a\) or \(-\)\(a\) [Fig 9.8 (a)]. Therefore, equation of the line L is either \(y=\ a\) or \(y=-a\). Choice of sign will depend upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the \(y\)-axis. Similarly, the equation of a vertical line at a distance \(b\) from the \(y\)-axis is either \(x=b\) or \(x=\ -\ b\) [Fig 9.8(b)].

**Example 4**: Find the equations of the lines parallel to axes and passing through (- 2, 3).

Solution Position of the lines is shown in the Fig 9.9. The \(y\)-coordinate of every point on the line parallel to \(x\)-axis is 3, therefore, equation of the line parallel to \(x\)-axis and passing through (- 2, 3) is \(y=3\). Similarly, equation of the line parallel to \(y\)-axis and passing through (- 2, 3) is \(x=-2\).

**9.3.2**_Point-slope form_ Suppose that \(\mathrm{P}_{0}\left(x_{\sigma}\ y_{0}\right)\) is a fixed point on a non-vertical line \(\mathrm{L}\), whose slope is \(m\). Let \(\mathrm{P}\left(x,\ y\right)\) be an arbitrary point on \(\mathrm{L}\) (Fig 9.10).

Then, by the definition, the slope of \(\mathrm{L}\) is given by

\[m=\frac{y-y_{0}}{x-x_{0}},\ \mathrm{i.e.,}\ y-y_{0}=m\left(x-x_{0}\right)\]

\[...(1)\]

Since the point \(\mathrm{P}_{0}\left(x_{0},\ y_{0}\right)\) along with all points \(\left(x,y\right)\) on \(\mathrm{L}\) satisfies (1) and no other point in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1) is indeed the equation for the given line \(\mathrm{L}\).

**Fig 9.10**Thus, the point \((x,y)\) lies on the line with slope \(m\) through the fixed point \((x_{0},y_{0})\), if and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation

\[y-y_{0}=m\ (x-x_{0})\]

**Example 5** Find the equation of the line through \((-2,3)\) with slope \(-4\).

SolutionHere \(m=-4\) and given point \((x_{0},y_{0})\) is \((-2,3)\).

By slope-intercept form formula (1) above, equation of the given line is

\[y-3=-4\ (x+2)\ \text{or}\]

\(4x+y+5=0\), which is the required equation.

#### Two-point form

Let the line L passes through two given points \(\text{P}_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})\) and \(\text{P}_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})\). Let P \((x,y)\) be a general point on L (Fig 9.11).

The three points \(\text{P}_{1}\), \(\text{P}_{2}\) and P are collinear, therefore, we have

slope of \(\text{P}_{1}\text{P}=\text{slope of }\text{P}_{1}\text{P}_{2}\)

i.e., \[\frac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{(x_{2}-x_{1})},\quad\text{or}\quad y -\bar{y}_{1}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}(x-x_{1}).\]

Thus, equation of the line passing through the points \((x_{1},y_{1})\) and \((x_{2},y_{2})\) is given by

\[y-y_{1}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}(x-x_{1})\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \...\ (2)\]

**Example 6** Write the equation of the line through the points \((1,-1)\) and \((3,5)\).

SolutionHere \(x_{1}=1\), \(y_{1}=-1\), \(x_{2}=3\) and \(y_{2}=5\). Using two-point form (2) above for the equation of the line, we have

\[y-\big{(}-1\big{)}=\frac{5-\big{(}-1\big{)}}{3-1}\big{(}x-1\big{)}\]

or

\[-3x+y+4=0\]

, which is the required equation.

#### Slope-intercept form

Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an intercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.

**Case I** Suppose a line L with slope \(m\) cuts the \(y\)-axis at a distance \(c\) from the origin (Fig 9.12). The distance \(c\) is called the \(y\)-\(intercept\) of the line L. Obviously, coordinates of the point where the line meet the \(y\)-axis are (0, \(c\)). Thus, L has slope \(m\) and passes through a fixed point (0, \(c\)). Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation of L is

\(y-c=m\,(x-0)\) or \(y=mx+c\)

Thus, the point (\(x\), \(y\)) on the line with slope \(m\) and \(y\)-intercept \(c\) lies on the line if and only if

\(y=mx+c\)

Note that the value of \(c\) will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made on the positive or negative side of the \(y\)-axis, respectively.

**Case II** Suppose line L with slope \(m\) makes \(x\)-intercept \(d\). Then equation of L is

\(y=m(x-d)\)

... (4)

Students may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I.

**Example 7** Write the equation of the lines for which \(\tan\,\theta=\dfrac{1}{2}\,\), where \(\theta\) is the inclination of the line and (i) \(y\)-intercept is

\(y=\dfrac{1}{2}\,\) (ii) \(x\)-intercept is 4.

**Solution** (i) Here, slope of the line is \(m=\tan\,\theta=\dfrac{1}{2}\,\)and \(y\) - intercept \(c=-\dfrac{3}{2}\,\). Therefore, by slope-intercept form (3) above, the equation of the line is

\(y=\dfrac{1}{2}\,x-\dfrac{3}{2}\,\) or \(\,2y-x+3=0\,\),

which is the required equation.

(ii) Here, we have \(m=\tan\,\theta=\dfrac{1}{2}\,\)and \(d=4\).

Therefore, by slope-intercept form (4) above, the equation of the line is

\(y=\dfrac{1}{2}\,(x-4)\) or \(\,2y-x+4=0\,\),

which is the required equation.

#### 9.3.5 Intercept - form

Suppose a line L makes \(x\)-intercept \(a\) and \(y\)-intercept \(b\) on the axes. Obviously L meets \(x\)-axis at the point \((a,0)\) and \(y\)-axis at the point \((0,b)\) (Fig 9.13). By two-point form of the equation of the line, we have

\[y-0=\frac{b-0}{0-a}\,(x-a)\quad\text{or}\quad ay=-bx+ab\,\]

i.e.,

\[\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1\.\]

Thus, equation of the line making intercepts \(a\) and \(b\) on \(x\)-and \(y\)-axis, respectively, is

\[\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1\.\]

**Example 8** Find the equation of the line, which makes intercepts \(-3\) and \(2\) on the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes respectively.

**Solution** Here \(a=-3\) and \(b=2\). By intercept form (5) above, equation of the line is

\[\cdot\frac{x}{-3}+\frac{y}{2}=\Gamma\quad\text{or}\quad 2\dot{x}-3y+6=0\.\]

Any equation of the form \(Ax+By+\Gamma=0\), where A and B are not zero simultaneously is called _general linear equation_ or _general equation of a line_.

### Distance of a Point From a Line

The distance of a point from a line is the length of the perpendicular drawn from the point to the line. Let L : Ax + By + C = 0 be a line, whose distance from the point P (\(x_{{}_{1}},y_{{}_{1}}\)) is \(d\). Draw a perpendicular PM from the point P to the line L (Fig 9.14). If the line meets the \(x\)-and \(y\)-axes at the points \(Q\) and \(R\), respectively. Then, coordinates of the points are \(\dot{Q}\!\left(-\dfrac{C}{A},\ \ 0\right)\!\)and \(R\)\(\left(0,\dfrac{C}{B}\right)\!\). Thus, the area of the triangle \(PQR\) is given by \(\cdot\) area \(\left(APQR\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}\,PM.QR\), which gives \(PM=\dfrac{2}{\text{area }(\Delta\text{PQR})}\) QR \(\cdot\) (1) Also, area \(\left(\Delta\text{PQR}\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}\,x_{1}\left(0+\dfrac{C}{B}\right)+ \left(-\dfrac{C}{A}\right)\left(-\dfrac{C}{B}-y_{1}\right)+0\left(y_{1}-0 \right)\) \(\cdot\) or \(2\) area \(\left(\Delta\text{PQR}\right)=\dfrac{C}{AB}\), \(\left|Ax_{1}+By_{1}+C\right|\), and \(\cdot\) QR \(\equiv\)\(\left(0+\dfrac{C}{A}\right)^{2}+\left(\ \ \dfrac{C}{B}\ \ -\ \ 0\right)^{2}=\left|\dfrac{C}{AB}\right|\)\(\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}\) Substituting the values of area (\(\Delta\text{PQR}\)) and QR in (1), we get \(\cdot\) PM = \(\dfrac{\left|\ \ Ax_{1}+By_{1}+C\right|}{\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}}\)

Figure 9.14.

\[\cdot\]

\[d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}\mathrm{A}x_{1}+\mathrm{B}y_{1}+\mathrm{C}\\ \sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+\mathrm{B}^{2}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+ \mathrm{B}^{2}}}\,.\]

Thus, the perpendicular distance \((d)\) of a line \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}=0\) from a point \((x_{1},y_{1})\) is given by

\[d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}\mathrm{A}x_{1}+\mathrm{B}y_{1}+\mathrm{C}\\ \sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+\mathrm{B}^{2}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+ \mathrm{B}^{2}}}\,.\]

#### 9.4.1 Distance between two parallel lines

We know that slopes of two parallel lines are equal.

Therefore, two parallel lines can be taken in the form

\[y=mx+c_{{}_{1}}\qquad\qquad...\ (1)\]

and \(y=mx+c_{{}_{2}}\qquad\qquad...\ (2)\)

Line (1) will intersect \(x\)-axis at the point

\[\mathrm{A}\overset{\cdot}{\left(-\frac{c_{{}_{1}}}{m},\ \ 0\right)}\mathrm{ as\ shown\ in\ Fig\ 9.15.}\]

Distance between two lines is equal to the length of the perpendicular from point

A to line (2). Therefore, distance between the lines (1) and (2) is

\[\cdot\]

\[d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}c_{1}-c_{2}\\ \sqrt{1+m^{2}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}\,.\]

Thus, the distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(y=mx+c_{{}_{1}}\) and \(y=mx+c_{{}_{2}}\) is given by

\[d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}c_{1}-c_{2}\\ \sqrt{1+m^{2}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{1+m^{2}}}\,\,.\]

If lines are given in general form, i.e., \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}_{{}_{1}}=0\) and \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}_{{}_{2}}=0\),

\[\cdot\]

then above formula will take the form

\[d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}\mathrm{C}_{{}_{1}}-\mathrm{C}_{{}_{2}}\\ \sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+\mathrm{B}^{2}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+ \mathrm{B}^{2}}}\]

Students can derive it themselves.

16. In the triangle ABC with vertices A \((2,3)\), B \((4,-1)\) and C \((1,2)\), find the equation and length of altitude from the vertex A.

**Example 11**: If the lines \(2x+y-3=0\), \(5x+ky-3=0\) and \(3x-y-2=0\) are concurrent, find the value of \(k\).

Solution Three lines are said to be concurrent, if they pass through a common point, i.e., point of intersection of any two lines lies on the third line. Here given lines are

\[\begin{array}{ll}2x+y-3=0&...\ (1)\\ 5x+ky-3=0&...\ (2)\\ 3x-y-2=0&...\ (3)\end{array}\]

Solving (1) and (3) by cross-multiplication method, we get

\[\dfrac{x}{-2-3}=\dfrac{y}{-9+4}=\dfrac{1}{-2-3}\quad\text{or}\quad x=1,\ y=1\,.\]

Therefore, the point of intersection of two lines is \((1,\,1)\). Since above three lines are concurrent, the point \((1,\,1)\) will satisfy equation (2) so that

\[5.1+k\.1-3=0\text{ or }k=-2.\]

**Example 12**: Find the distance of the line \(4x-y=0\) from the point P (4, 1) measured along the line making an angle of \(135^{\circ}\) with the positive \(x\)-axis.

**Solution** Given line is \(4x-y=0\)

In order to find the distance of the line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along another line, we have to find the point of intersection of both the lines. For this purpose, we will first find the equation of the second line (Fig 9.16). Slope of second line is tan \(135^{\circ}=-1\). Equation of the line with slope - 1 through the point P (4, 1) is

\[y-1=-1\ (x-4)\ \text{or}\ x+y-5=0\]

Solving (1) and (2), we get \(x=1\) and \(y=4\) so that point of intersection of the two lines is Q (1, 4). Now, distance of line (1) from the point P(4, 1) along the line (2)

= the distance between the points P (4, 1) and Q (1, 4).

\[=\sqrt[]{(1-4)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}=3\sqrt{2}\ \text{units}.\]

**Example 13**: Assuming that straight lines work as the plane mirror for a point, find the image of the point (1,2) in the line \(x-3y+4=0\).

**Solution** Let Q (\(h,k\)) is the image of the point P (1, 2) in the line

\[x-3y+4=0\]

... (1)

Therefore, the line (1) is the perpendicular bisector of line segment PQ (Fig 9.17).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:170]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:171]

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \alpha_{1}=\frac{26}{23}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \alpha_{2}=\frac{20}{23}\ \ \text{and hence},\ \beta_{1}=5.\frac{26}{23}+4=\frac{222}{23}\.\end{array}\]

Equation of the required line passing through (1, 5) and (\(\alpha_{1}\), \(\beta_{1}\)) is

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ y-5=\frac{\beta_{1}-5}{\alpha_{1}-1}(x-1)\ \text{or}\ \ y-5=\frac{ \frac{222}{23}-5}{ \frac{26}{23}-1}(x-1)\end{array}\]

or

\[107x-3y-92=0,\]

which is the equation of required line.

**Example 16**: Show that the path of a moving point such that its distances from two lines \(3x-2y=5\) and \(3x+2y=5\) are equal is a straight line.

**Solution** Given lines are

\[3x-2y=5\]

and

\[3x+2y=5\]

\[\ldots\]

(2)

Let (\(h\), \(k\)) is any point, whose distances from the lines'(1) and (2) are equal. Therefore

\[\frac{\left|3h-2k-5\right|}{\sqrt{9+4}}=\frac{\left|3h+2k-5\right|}{\sqrt{9+4} }\ \text{or}\left|3h-2k-5\right|=\left|3h+2k-5\right|,\]

which gives \(3h-2k-5=3h+2k-5\) or \(-(3h-2k-5)=3h+2k-5\).

Solving these two relations we get \(k=0\) or \(h=\frac{5}{3}\). Thus, the point (\(h\), \(k\)) satisfies the equations \(y=0\) or \(x=\frac{5}{3}\), which represent straight lines. Hence, path of the point equidistant from the lines (1) and (2) is a straight line.

The point \((x,y)\) on the line with slope \(m\) and \(y\)-intercept \(c\) lies on the line if and only if \(y=mx+c\).

If a line with slope \(m\) makes \(x\)-intercept \(d\). Then equation of the line is \(y=m\)\((x-d)\).

Equation of a line making intercepts \(a\) and \(b\) on the \(x\)-and \(y\)-axis, respectively, is \(\dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{b}=1\).

Any equation of the form \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}=0\), with \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are not zero, simultaneously, is called the _general linear equation_ or _general equation of a line_.

The perpendicular distance \((d)\) of a line \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}=0\) from a point \((x_{1},y_{1})\) is given by \(d=\dfrac{\left|\mathrm{A}x_{1}+\mathrm{B}y_{1}+\mathrm{C}\right|}{\sqrt{ \mathrm{A}^{2}+\mathrm{B}^{2}}}\).

Distance between the parallel lines \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}_{1}=0\) and \(\mathrm{A}x+\mathrm{B}y+\mathrm{C}_{2}=0\), is given by \(d=\dfrac{\left|\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{2}\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+ \mathrm{B}^{2}}}\).

### 10.1 Introduction

In the preceding Chapter 10, we have studied various forms of the equations of a line. In this Chapter, we shall study about some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact known as _conic sections_ or more commonly _conics_ because they can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double mapped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide range of applications in fields such as planetary motion, design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights and automobile headlights, etc. Now, in the subsequent sections we will see how the intersection of a plane with a double mapped right circular cone results in different types of curves.

### 10.2 Sections of a Cone

Let \(l\) be a fixed vertical line and \(m\) be another line intersecting it at a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle \(\alpha\) (Fig10.1).

Suppose we rotate the line \(m\) around the line \(l\) in such a way that the angle \(\alpha\) remains constant. Then the surface generated is a double-napped right circular hollow cone herein after referred as

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:177]

#### 10.2.2 Degenerated conic sections

When the plane cuts at the vertex of the cone, we have the following different cases:

**(a)**: When \(\alpha<\beta\leq 90^{\circ}\), then the section is a point (Fig10.8).
**(b)**: When \(\beta=\alpha\), the plane contains a generator of the cone and the section is a straight line (Fig10.9).

It is the degenerated case of a parabola.
**(c)**: When \(0\leq\beta<\alpha\), the section is a pair of intersecting straight lines (Fig10.10). It is the degenerated case of a _hyperbola_.

In the following sections, we shall obtain the equations of each of these conic sections in standard form by defining them based on geometric properties.

**Fig 10. 8**

**Definition 1** A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point in the plane.

The fixed point is called the _centre of the circle_ and the distance from the centre to a point on the circle is called the _radius_ of the circle (Fig 10.11).

The equation of the circle is simplest if the centre of the circle is at the origin. However, we derive below the equation of the circle with a given centre and radius (Fig 10.12).

Given C (\(h,k\)) be the centre and \(r\) the radius of circle. Let P(\(x,y\)) be any point on the circle (Fig10.12). Then, by the definition, \(\mid\) CP \(\mid\)\(=r\). By the distance formula, we have

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \sqrt{(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}}=r\\ (x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}\end{array}\]

i.e.

This is the required equation of the circle with centre at (\(h\),\(k\)) and radius \(r\).

**Example 1**: Find an equation of the circle with centre at (0,0) and radius \(r\).

**Solution** Here \(h=k=0\). Therefore, the equation of the circle is \(x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\).

**Example 2**: Find the equation of the circle with centre (-3, 2) and radius 4.

**Solution** Here \(h=-3\), \(k=2\).and \(r=4\). Therefore, the equation of the required circle is

**Example 3**: Find the centre and the radius of the circle \(x^{2}+y^{2}+8x+10y-8=0\)

**Solution** The given equation is

\[(x^{2}+8x)\ +(y^{2}+10y)=8\]

Now, completing the squares within the parenthesis, we get

\[\begin{array}{c}(x^{2}+8x+16)\ +\ (y^{2}+10y+25)\ =8+16+25\end{array}\]

i.e.

\[\begin{array}{c}(x+4)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=49\end{array}\]

i.e.

\[\begin{array}{c}\{x-(-4)\}^{2}+\{y-(-5)\}^{2}=7^{2}\end{array}\]

Therefore, the given circle has centre at (\(-\) 4, -5) and radius 7.

**Example 4**: Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points \((2,-2)\), and (3,4) and whose centre lies on the line \(x+y=2\).

Solution Let the equation of the circle be \((x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}\).

Since the circle passes through \((2,-2)\) and (3,4), we have

\((2-h)^{2}+(-2-k)^{2}=r^{2}\)... (1)

and \((3-h)^{2}+(4-k)^{2}=r^{2}\)... (2)

Also since the centre lies on the line \(x+y=2\), we have

\(h+k=2\)... (3)

Solving the equations (1), (2) and (3), we get

\(h=0.7,\)\(k=1.3\) and \(r^{2}=12.58\)

Hence, the equation of the required circle is

\((x-0.7)^{2}+(y-1.3)^{2}=12.58\).

**10.4 Parabola**

**Definition 2** A parabola is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line and a fixed point (not on the line) in the plane.

The fixed line is called the _directrix_ of the parabola and the fixed point F is called the _focus_ (Fig 10.13). ('Para' means 'for' and 'bola' means 'throwing', i.e., the shape described when you throw a ball in the air).

**10.5 Note** If the fixed point lies on the fixed line, then the set of points in the plane, which are equidistant from the fixed point and the fixed line is the straight line through the fixed point and perpendicular to the fixed line. We call this straight line as _degenerate case_ of the parabola.

A line through the focus and perpendicular to the _directrix_ is called the _axis_ of the parabola. The point of intersection of parabola with the axis is called the vertex of the parabola (Fig10.14).

**10.4.1 Standard equations of parabola**

The equation of a _parabola_ is simplest if the vertex is at the origin and the axis of symmetry is along the \(x\)-axis or \(y\)-axis. The four possible such orientations of parabola are shown below in Fig10.15 (a) to (d).

**10.6

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:183]

Hence, any point on the parabola satisfies

\[y^{2}=4ax.\]

Conversely, let \(\mathrm{P}(x,y)\) satisfy the equation (2)

\[\mathrm{PF} =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(x-a\right)^{2}+y^{2}}} =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(x-a\right)^{2}+4ax}} \tag{3}\] \[=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(x+a\right)^{2}}}=\mathrm{PB}...\]

and so \(\mathrm{P}(x,y)\) lies on the parabola.

Thus, from (2) and (3) we have proved that the equation to the parabola with vertex at the origin, focus at (\(a,0\)) and directrix \(x=-a\) is \(y^{2}=4ax\).

**Discussion** In equation (2), since \(a>0\), \(x\) can assume any positive value or zero but no negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth quadrants. The axis of the parabola is the positive \(x\)-axis.

Similarly, we can derive the equations of the parabola in:

\[\mathrm{Fig\leavevmode\nobreak\ 11.15\leavevmode\nobreak\ (b)\leavevmode\nobreak\ as\leavevmode\nobreak\ }y^{2}=-4ax,\] \[\mathrm{Fig\leavevmode\nobreak\ 11.15\leavevmode\nobreak\ (c)\leavevmode\nobreak\ as \leavevmode\nobreak\ }x^{2}=4ay,\] \[\mathrm{Fig\leavevmode\nobreak\ 11.15\leavevmode\nobreak\ (d)\leavevmode\nobreak\ as \leavevmode\nobreak\ }x^{2}=-4ay,\]

These four equations are known as _standard equations_ of parabolas.

**Note** The standard equations of parabolas have focus on one of the coordinate axis; vertex at the _origin_ and thereby the directrix is parallel to the other coordinate axis. However, the study of the equations of parabolas with focus at any point and any line as directrix is beyond the scope here.

From the standard equations of the parabolas, Fig10.15, we have the following observations:

1. Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola.If the equation has a \(y^{2}\) term, then the axis of symmetry is along the \(x\)-axis and if the equation has an \(x^{2}\) term, then the axis of symmetry is along the \(y\)-axis.
2. When the axis of symmetry is along the \(x\)-axis the parabola opens to the (a) right if the coefficient of \(x\) is positive, (b) left if the coefficient of \(x\) is negative.
3. When the axis of symmetry is along the \(y\)-axis the parabola opens (c) upwards if the coefficient of \(y\) is positive. (d) downwards if the coefficient of \(y\) is negative.

#### 10.4.2 _Latus rectum_

**Definition 3**: _Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig10.17)._

**To find the Length of the latus rectum of the parabola \(y^{2}=4ax\) (Fig 10.18).**

By the definition of the parabola, \(\mathrm{AF}=\mathrm{AC}\).

But \(\mathrm{AC}=\mathrm{FM}=2a\)

Hence \(\mathrm{AF}=2a\).

And since the parabola is symmetric with respect to \(x\)-axis \(\mathrm{AF}=\mathrm{FB}\) and so

AB = Length of the latus rectum = \(4a\).

**Example 5**: _Find the coordinates of the focus, axis, the equation of the directrix and latus rectum of the parabola \(y^{2}=8x\)._

**Solution**: _The given equation involves \(y^{2}\), so the axis of symmetry is along the \(x\)-axis._

_The coefficient of_ \(x\) _is positive so the parabola opens to the right. Comparing with the given equation_ \(y^{2}=4ax\)_, we find that_ \(a=2\)_._

_Thus, the focus of the parabola is (2, 0) and the equation of the directrix of the parabola is \(x=-2\) (Fig 10.19)._

_Length of the latus rectum is \(4a=4\times 2=8\)._

**Example 6**: Find the equation of the parabola with focus (2,0) and directrix \(x=-\,2\).

SolutionSince the focus (2,0) lies on the \(x\)-axis, the \(x\)-axis itself is the axis of the parabola. Hence the equation of the parabola is of the form either \(y^{2}=4ax\) or \(y^{2}=-\,4ax\). Since the directrix is \(x=-\,2\) and the focus is (2,0), the parabola is to be of the form \(y^{2}=4ax\) with \(a=2\). Hence the required equation is \(y^{2}=4(2)x=8x\)

**Example 7**: Find the equation of the parabola with vertex at (0, 0) and focus at (0, 2).

SolutionSince the vertex is at (0,0) and the focus is at (0,2) which lies on \(y\)-axis, the \(y\)-axis is the axis of the parabola. Therefore, equation of the parabola is of the form \(x^{2}=4ay\). thus, we have

**Example 8**: Find the equation of the parabola which is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, and passes through the point (2,-3).

SolutionSince the parabola is symmetric about \(y\)-axis and has its vertex at the origin, the equation is of the form \(x^{2}=4ay\) or \(x^{2}=-\,4ay\), where the sign depends on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. But the parabola passes through (2,-3) which lies in the fourth quadrant, it must open downwards. Thus the equation is of the form \(x^{2}=-\,4ay\).

Since the parabola passes through (2,-3), we have

Therefore, the equation of the parabola is

In each of the following Exercises 1 to 6, find the coordinates of the focus, axis of the parabola, the equation of the directrix and the length of the latus rectum.

**1.**: \(y^{2}=12x\) **2.**: \(x^{2}=6y\) **3.**: \(y^{2}=-\,8x\)
**4.**: \(x^{2}=-\,16y\) **5.**: \(y^{2}=10x\) **6.**: \(x^{2}=-\,9y\)

In each of the Exercises 7 to 12, find the equation of the parabola that satisfies the given conditions:Focus (6,0); directrix \(x=-6\)Focus (0,-3); directrix \(y=3\)FVertex (0,0); focus (3,0)Focus (0,0); focus (-2,0)Focus (0,0) passing through (2,3) and axis is along \(x\)-axis.

Vertex (0,0), passing through (5,2) and symmetric with respect to \(y\)-axis.

### Ellipse

**Definition 4** An _ellipse_ is the set of all points in a plane, the sum of whose distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.

The two fixed points are called the _foci_ (plural of '_focus_') of the ellipse (Fig10.20).

**Note** The constant which is the sum of the distances of a point on the ellipse from the two fixed points is always greater than the distance between the two fixed points.

The mid point of the line segment joining the foci is called the _centre_ of the ellipse. The line segment through the foci of the ellipse is called the _major axis_ and the line segment through the centre and perpendicular to the major axis is called the _minor axis_. The end points of the major axis are called the _vertices_ of the ellipse(Fig 10.21).

**Fig 10.21**

We denote the length of the major axis by \(2a\), the length of the minor axis by \(2b\) and the distance between the foci by \(2c\). Thus, the length of the semi major axis is \(a\) and semi-minor axis is \(b\) (Fig10.22).

Relationship between semi-major axis, semi-minor axis and the distance of the focus from the centre of the ellipse (Fig 10.23)

Take a point P at one end of the major axis.

Sum of the distances of the point P to the foci is \(\mathrm{F}_{1}\mathrm{P}+\mathrm{F}_{2}\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F}_{1}\mathrm{O}+ \mathrm{OP}+\mathrm{F}_{2}\mathrm{P}\)

\[\mathrm{(Since,\ \ F}_{1}\mathrm{P} =\mathrm{F}_{1}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{OP})\] \[=c+a+a-c=2a\]

Take a point Q at one end of the minor axis.

Sum of the distances from the point Q to the foci is

\[\mathrm{F}_{1}\mathrm{Q}+\mathrm{F}_{2}\mathrm{Q}=\sqrt{b^{2}\ +\ c^{2}}\ +\sqrt{b^{2}+c^{2}}\ =\ 2 \sqrt{b^{2}+c^{2}}\]

Since both P and Q lies on the ellipse.

By the definition of ellipse, we have

\[2\sqrt{b^{2}\ +c^{2}}\ =\ 2a,\mathrm{i.e.,}\]

or

\[a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2},\mathrm{i.e.,}\ c=\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\.\]

#### Eccentricity

**Definition 5**: The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio of the distances from the centre of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse (eccentricity is denoted by \(e\)) i.e., \(e=\frac{c}{a}\)

Then since the focus is at a distance of \(c\) from the centre, in terms of the eccentricity the focus is at a distance of \(ae\) from the centre.

#### Standard equations of an ellipse

The equation of an ellipse is simplest if the centre of the ellipse is at the origin and the foci are on the \(x\)-axis or \(y\)-axis. The two such possible orientations are shown in Fig 10.24.

We will derive the equation for the ellipse shown above in Fig 10.24 (a) with foci on the \(x\)-axis.

Let \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) be the foci and \(O\) be the mid-point of the line segment \(F_{1}F_{2}\). Let \(O\) be the origin and the line from \(O\) through \(F_{2}\) be the positive \(x\)-axis and that through \(F_{1}\) as the negative \(x\)-axis.

Let, the line through \(O\) perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis be the \(y\)-axis. Let the coordinates of \(F_{1}\) be

(\(-c\), \(0\)) and \(F_{2}\) be (\(c\), \(0\)) (Fig 10.25).

Let \(P(x,y)\) be any point on the ellipse such that the sum of the distances from \(P\) to the two foci be \(2a\) so given

\(PF_{1}+PF_{2}=2a\).... (1)

Using the distance formula, we have

\(\sqrt{\left(x+c\right)^{2}+y^{2}}\ +\sqrt{\left(x-c\right)^{2}+y^{2}}\ \ =\ 2a\)

i.e., \(\sqrt{\left(x+c\right)^{2}+y^{2}}\ \ =\ 2a-\sqrt{\left(x-c\right)^{2}+y^{2}}\)

Squaring both sides, we get

\((x+c)^{2}+y^{2}=4a^{2}-4a\ \sqrt{\left(x-c\right)^{2}+y^{2}}\ +\ \left(x-c\right)^{2}+y^{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:190]

So, any point that satisfies \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}\ +\ \dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\), satisfies the geometric condition and so P(\(x\), \(y\)) lies on the ellipse.

Hence from (2) and (3), we proved that the equation of an ellipse with centre of the origin and major axis along the \(x\)-axis is

\[\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\]

**Discussion** From the equation of the ellipse obtained above, it follows that for every point P (\(x,y\)) on the ellipse, we have

\[\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}\ =\ 1\ -\ \dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}\ \leq\ 1,\ \ \text{i.e.,}\ \ x^{2}\leq\ a^{2},\ \text{so}-a\leq\ x\leq\ a.\]

Therefore, the ellipse lies between the lines \(x=-a\) and \(x=a\) and touches these lines.

Similarly, the ellipse lies between the lines \(y=-b\) and \(y=b\) and touches these lines.

Similarly, we can derive the equation of the ellipse in Fig 10.24 (b) as \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}+\dfrac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}=1\).

These two equations are known as _standard equations_ of the ellipses.

Note The standard equations of ellipses have centre at the origin and the major and minor axis are coordinate axes. However, the study of the ellipses with centre at any other point, and any line through the centre as major and the minor axes passing through the centre and perpendicular to major axis are beyond the scope here.

From the standard equations of the ellipses (Fig10.24), we have the following observations:

1. Ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the coordinate axes since if \((x,y)\) is a point on the ellipse, then \((-\,x,y)\), \((x,-y)\) and \((-\,x,-y)\) are also points on the ellipse.

2. The foci always lie on the major axis. The major axis can be determined by finding the intercepts on the axes of symmetry. That is, major axis is along the \(x\)-axis if the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) has the larger denominator and it is along the \(y\)-axis if the coefficient of \(y^{2}\) has the larger denominator.

#### 10.5.4 _Latus rectum_

**Definition 6**: Latus rectum of an ellipse is a line segment perpendicular to the major axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the ellipse (Fig 10.26).

**To find the length of the latus rectum**

**of the ellipse**\(\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\)

Let the length of AF\({}_{2}\) be \(l\).

Then the coordinates of A are \((c,\,l)\),i.e., \((ae,\,l)\)

Since A lies on the ellipse \(\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\), we have

But

\[\frac{(ae)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{l^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\]

Therefore

\[l^{2}=\frac{b^{4}}{a^{2}}\]

, i.e., \(l=\frac{b^{2}}{a}\)

Since the ellipse is symmetric with respect to \(y\)-axis (of course, it is symmetric w.r.t. both the coordinate axes), AF\({}_{2}=\) F\({}_{2}\)B and so length of the latus rectum is \(\frac{2b^{2}}{a}\).

**Example 9**: Find the coordinates of the foci, the vertices, the length of major axis, the eccentricity and the latus rectum of the ellipse

\[\frac{x^{2}}{25}+\frac{y^{2}}{9}=1\]

**Solution**: Since denominator of \(\frac{x^{2}}{25}\) is larger than the denominator of \(\frac{y^{2}}{9}\), the majoraxis is along the \(x\)-axis. Comparing the given equation with \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\), we get

\(a=5\) and \(b=3\). Also

\(c=\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}=\sqrt{25-9}=4\)

Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are (- 4,0) and (4,0), vertices are (- 5, 0) and (5, 0). Length of the major axis is 10 units length of the minor axis \(2b\) is 6 units and the eccentricity is \(\dfrac{4}{5}\) and latus rectum is \(\dfrac{2b^{2}}{a}=\dfrac{18}{5}\).

**Example 10**: Find the coordinates of the foci, the vertices, the lengths of major and minor axes and the eccentricity of the ellipse \(9x^{2}+4y^{2}=36\).

SolutionThe given equation of the ellipse can be written in standard form as

\(\dfrac{x^{2}}{4}+\dfrac{y^{2}}{9}=1\)

Since the denominator of \(\dfrac{y^{2}}{9}\) is larger than the denominator of \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{4}\), the major axis is along the \(y\)-axis. Comparing the given equation with the standard equation

\(\dfrac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}+\dfrac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}=1\), we have \(b=2\) and \(a=3\).

Also

\(c=\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\)

\(\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}=1\), we have \(b=2\) and \(a=3\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:194]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:195]

The term "_difference_" that is used in the definition means the distance to the farther point minus the distance to the closer point. The two fixed points are called the foci of the hyperbola. The mid-point of the line segment joining the foci is called the _centre of the hyperbola_. The line through the foci is called the _transverse axis_ and the line through the centre and perpendicular to the transverse axis is called the _conjugate axis_. The points at which the hyperbola intersects the transverse axis are called the _vertices of the hyperbola_ (Fig 10.27).

We denote the distance between the two foci by \(2c\), the distance between two vertices (the length of the transverse axis) by \(2a\) and we define the quantity \(b\) as \(b\ =\ \sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}\)

Also \(2b\) is the length of the conjugate axis (Fig 10.28).

**To find the constant \(\mathbf{P_{1}F_{2}-P_{1}F_{1}}\):**

By taking the point P at A and B in the Fig 10.28, we have \(\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{1}}-\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{2}}=\mathrm{AF}_{{}_{2}}-\mathrm{AF}_{{}_ {1}}\) (by the definition of the hyperbola) \(\mathrm{BA}+\mathrm{AF}_{{}_{1}}-\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{2}}=\mathrm{AB}+\mathrm{BF}_ {{}_{2}}-\mathrm{AF}_{{}_{1}}\)

i.e., \(\mathrm{AF}_{{}_{1}}=\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{2}}\)

So that, \(\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{1}}-\mathrm{BF}_{{}_{2}}=\mathrm{BA}+\mathrm{AF}_{{}_{1}}- \mathrm{BF}_{{}_{2}}=\mathrm{BA}=2a\)

#### 10.6.1 Eccentricity

**Definition 8** Just like an ellipse, the ratio \(e=\dfrac{c}{a}\) is called the _eccentricity of the hyperbola_. Since \(c\geq a\), the eccentricity is never less than one. In terms of the eccentricity, the foci are at a distance of \(ae\) from the centre.

#### 10.6.2 Standard equation of Hyperbola

The equation of a hyperbola is simplest if the centre of the hyperbola is at the origin and the foci are on the \(x\)-axis or \(y\)-axis. The two such possible orientations are shown in Fig10.29.

We will derive the equation for the hyperbola shown in Fig 10.29(a) with _foci_ on the \(x\)-axis.

Let \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) be the foci and \(O\) be the mid-point of the line segment \(F_{1}F_{2}\). Let \(O\) be the origin and the line through \(O\) through \(F_{2}\) be the positive \(x\)-axis and that through \(F_{1}\) as the negative \(x\)-axis. The line through \(O\) perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis be the \(y\)-axis. Let the coordinates of \(F_{1}\) be \(X\), (\(-\)\(c\),\(0\)) and \(F_{2}\) be (\(c\),\(0\)) (Fig 10.30).

Let \(P(x,y)\) be any point on the hyperbola such that the difference of the distances from \(P\) to the farther point minus the closer point be \(2a\). So given, \(PF_{1}-PF_{2}=2a\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:198]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:199]

The foci are always on the transverse axis. It is the positive term whose denominator gives the transverse axis. For example, \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{9}-\dfrac{y^{2}}{16}=1\) has transverse axis along \(x\)-axis of length 6, while \(\dfrac{y^{2}}{25}-\dfrac{x^{2}}{16}=1\) has transverse axis along y-axis of length 10.

#### 10.6.3. _Latus rectum_

**Definition 9**: Latus rectum of hyperbola is a line segment perpendicular to the transverse axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the hyperbola.

As in ellipse, it is easy to show that the length of the latus rectum in hyperbola is \(\dfrac{2b^{2}}{a}\).

**Example 14**: Find the coordinates of the foci and the vertices, the eccentricity,the length of the latus rectum of the hyperbolas.

\(\dfrac{x^{2}}{9}-\dfrac{y^{2}}{16}=1\), (ii) \(y^{2}-16x^{2}=16\)

**Solution (i) Comparing the equation \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{9}-\dfrac{y^{2}}{16}=1\) with the standard equation \(\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\)**

Here, \(a=3\), \(b=4\) and \(c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}=\sqrt{9+16}=5\)

Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are \((\pm 5,0)\) and that of vertices are \((\pm 3,0)\).Also, The eccentricity \(\dfrac{c}{a}=\dfrac{5}{3}\). The latus rectum \(=\dfrac{2b^{2}}{a}=\dfrac{32}{3}\)

(ii) Dividing the equation by 16 on both sides, we have \(\dfrac{y^{2}}{16}-\dfrac{x^{2}}{1}=1\)

Comparing the equation with the standard equation \(\dfrac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}-\dfrac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\), we find that

\(a=4\), \(b=1\) and \(c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}=\sqrt{16+1}=\sqrt{17}\).

Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are \((0,\ \pm\sqrt{17}\ )\) and that of the vertices are \((0,\pm 4).\) Also,

\[.\]

The eccentricity \(\ e=\frac{c}{a}=\frac{\sqrt{17}}{4}\.\) The latus rectum \(=\frac{2b^{2}}{a}=\frac{1}{2}\.\)

**Example 15**: Find the equation of the hyperbola with foci \((0,\ \pm\ 3)\) and vertices \((0,\pm\frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}\ ).\)

SolutionSince the foci is on y-axis, the equation of the hyperbola is of the form

\[\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\]

Since vertices are \((0,\ \ \pm\frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}\ ),\ \ a=\ \frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}\.\)

Also, since foci are \((0,\ \pm\ 3);\)\(c=3\) and \(b^{2}=c^{2}-a^{2}=\frac{25}{4}\).

Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is

\[\frac{y^{2}}{\left(\frac{11}{4}\right)}-\frac{x^{2}}{4}=1\,\ \text{i.e.,}\ 100y^{2}\ 44\ x^{2}=275.\]

**Example 16**: Find the equation of the hyperbola where foci are \((0,\pm 12)\) and the length of the latus rectum is \(36\).

SolutionSince foci are \((0,\pm 12)\), it follows that \(c=12\).

Length of the latus rectum \(=\ \frac{2b^{2}}{a}=36\) or \(\ \ b^{2}=18a\)

Therefore \(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\); gives

\[144=a^{2}+18a\]

i.e., \(a^{2}+18a-144=0\),

So \(a=-\ 24\), \(6\).

Since \(a\) cannot be negative, we take \(a=6\) and so \(\ b^{2}=108\).

Therefore, the equation of the required hyperbola is \(\ \ \frac{y^{2}}{36}-\frac{x^{2}}{108}=1\,\ \text{i.e.,}\ 3y^{2}-x^{2}=108\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:202]

is a deflection of 3 cm at the centre and the deflected beam is in the shape of a parabola. How far from the centre is the deflection 1 cm?

SolutionLet the vertex be at the lowest point and the axis vertical. Let the coordinate axis be chosen as shown in Fig 10.32.

The equation of the parabola takes the form \(x^{2}=4ay\). Since it passes through \(\dot{\left(6,\dfrac{3}{100}\right)}\), we have \(\left(6\right)^{2}=4a\left(\dfrac{3}{100}\right)\), i.e. \(a=\dfrac{36\times 100}{12}=300\) m. Let AB be the deflection of the beam which is \(\dfrac{1}{100}\) m. Coordinates of B are \(\left(x,\dfrac{2}{100}\right)\). Therefore \(x^{2}=4\times 300\times\dfrac{2}{100}=24\) i.e. \(x=\sqrt{24}=2\sqrt{6}\) metres

**Example 19**: A rod AB of length 15 cm rests in between two coordinate axes in such a way that the end point A lies on \(x\)-axis and end point B lies on \(y\)-axis. A point \(\mathrm{P}(x,y)\) is taken on the rod in such a way that \(\mathrm{AP}=6\) cm. Show that the locus of P is an ellipse.

SolutionLet AB be the rod making an angle \(\theta\) with \(\mathrm{OX}\) as shown in Fig 10.33 and P \(\left(x,y\right)\) the point on it such that \(\mathrm{AP}=6\) cm. Since \(\mathrm{AB}=15\) cm, we have

\(\mathrm{PB}=9\) cm.

From P draw PQ and PR perpendiculars on \(y\)-axis and \(x\)-axis, respectively.

### Summary

In this Chapter the following concepts and generalisations are studied.

Length of the latus rectum of the hyperbola : \(\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\) is : \(\frac{2b^{2}}{a}\).

The eccentricity of a hyperbola is the ratio of the distances from the centre of the hyperbola to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the hyperbola.

### Historical Note

Geometry is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics. The Greek geometers investigated the properties of many curves that have theoretical and practical importance. Euclid wrote his treatise on geometry around 300 B.C. He was the first who organised the geometric figures based on certain axioms suggested by physical considerations. Geometry as initially studied by the ancient Indians and Greeks, who made essentially no use of the process of algebra. The synthetic approach to the subject of geometry as given by Euclid and in _Sulbasutras_, etc., was continued for some 1300 years. In the 200 B.C., Apollonius wrote a book called '_The Conic_' which was all about conic sections with many important discoveries that have remained unsurpassed for eighteen centuries.

Modern analytic geometry is called '_Cartesian_' after the name of Rene Descartes (1596-1650) whose relevant 'La Geometrie' was published in 1637. But the fundamental principle and method of analytical geometry were already discovered by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Unfortunately, Fermats treatise on the subject, entitled _Ad Locus Planos et So LIDOS Isagoge_ (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci) was published only posthumously in 1679. So, Descartes came to be regarded as the unique inventor of the analytical geometry.

Isaac Barrow avoided using cartesian method. Newton used method of undetermined coefficients to find equations of curves. He used several types of coordinates including polar and bipolar. Leibnitz used the terms '_abscissa'_, 'ordinate' and 'coordinate'. L' Hospital (about 1700) wrote an important textbook on analytical geometry.

Clairaut (1729) was the first to give the distance formula although in clumsy form. He also gave the intercept form of the linear equation. Cramer (1750)made formal use of the two axes and gave the equation of a circle as

\[(y-a)^{2}+(b-x)^{2}=r\]

He gave the best exposition of the analytical geometry of his time. Monge (1781) gave the modern 'point-slope' form of equation of a line as

\[y-y^{\prime}=a\ (x-x^{\prime})\]

and the condition of perpendicularity of two lines as \(aa^{\prime}+1=0\).

S.F. Lacroix (1765-1843) was a prolific textbook writer, but his contributions to analytical geometry are found scattered. He gave the 'two-point' form of equation of a line as

\[y-\beta=\frac{\beta^{\prime}-\beta}{a^{\prime}-\alpha}(x-\alpha)\]

and the length of the perpendicular from \((\alpha,\beta)\) on \(y=ax+b\) as \(\beta-a-b\).

His formula for finding angle between two lines was \(\tan\theta=\left(\frac{a^{\prime}-a}{1+aa^{\prime}}\right)\). It is, of course, surprising that one has to wait for more than 150 years after the invention of analytical geometry before finding such essential basic formula. In 1818, C. Lame, a civil engineer, gave \(m\)E + \(m^{\prime}\)E = 0 as the curve passing through the points of intersection of two loci E = 0 and E' = 0.

Many important discoveries, both in Mathematics and Science, have been linked to the conic sections. The Greeks particularly Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) and Apollonius (200 B.C.) studied conic sections for their own beauty. These curves are important tools for present day exploration of outer space and also for research into behaviour of atomic particles.

## Introduction to the dimensional geometry

### 1.1 Introduction

You may recall that to locate the position of a point in a plane, we need two intersecting mutually perpendicular lines in the plane. These lines are called the _coordinate axes_ and the two numbers are called the _coordinates of the point with respect to the axes_. In actual life, we do not have to deal with points lying in a plane only. For example, consider the position of a ball thrown in space at different points of time or the position of an aeroplane as it flies from one place to another at different times during its flight.

Similarly, if we were to locate the position of the lowest tip of an electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a room or the position of the central tip of the ceiling fan in a room, we will not only require the perpendicular distances of the point to be located from two perpendicular walls of the room but also the height of the point from the floor of the room. Therefore, we need not only two but three numbers representing the perpendicular distances of the point from three mutually perpendicular planes, namely the floor of the room and two adjacent walls of the room. The three numbers representing the three distances are called the _coordinates of the point with reference to the three coordinate planes_. So, a point in space has three coordinates. In this Chapter, we shall study the basic concepts of geometry in three dimensional space.*

### Coordinate Axes and Coordinate Planes in Three Dimensional Space

Consider three planes intersecting at a point O such that these three planes are mutually perpendicular to each other (Fig 11.1). These three planes intersect along the lines X'OX, Y'OY and Z'OZ, called the \(x,y\) and \(z\)_-axes_, respectively. We may note that these lines are mutually perpendicular to each other. These lines constitute the _rectangular coordinate system_. The planes XOY, YOZ and ZOX, called, respectively the XY-\(plane\), YZ-\(plane\) and the ZX-\(plane\), are known as the three coordinate planes. We take the XOY plane as the plane of the paper and the line Z'OZ as perpendicular to the plane XOY. If the plane of the paper is considered as horizontal, then the line Z'OZ will be vertical. The distances measured from XY-plane upwards in the direction of OZ are taken as positive and those measured downwards in the direction of OZ' are taken as negative. Similarly, the distance measured to the right of ZX-plane along OY are taken as positive, to the left of ZX-plane and along OY' as negative, in front of the YZ-plane along OX as positive and to the back of it along OX' as negative. The point O is called the _origin_ of the coordinate system. The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known as _octants_. These octants could be named as XOYZ, X'OYZ, X'OY'Z, XOY'Z, XOYZ', X'OYZ', X'OY'Z' and XOY'Z'. and denoted by I, II, III,..., VIII, respectively.

### Coordinates of a Point in Space

Having chosen a fixed coordinate system in the space, consisting of coordinate axes, coordinate planes and the origin, we now explain, as to how, given a point in the space, we associate with it three coordinates (\(x\),\(y\),\(z\)) and conversely, given a triplet of three numbers (\(x,y,z\)), how, we locate a point in the space.

Given a point P in space, we drop a perpendicular PM on the XY-plane with M as the foot of this perpendicular (Fig 11.2). Then, from the point M, we draw a perpendicular ML to the \(x\)-axis, meeting it at L. Let OL be \(x\), LM be \(y\) and MP be \(z\). Then \(x\),\(y\) and \(z\) are called the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)_coordinates_, respectively, of the point P in the space. In Fig 11.2, we may note that the point P (\(x,y,z\)) lies in the octant XOYZ and so all \(x,y\), \(z\) are positive. If P was in any other octant, the signs of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) would changeaccordingly. Thus, to each point P in the space there corresponds an ordered triplet \((x,y,z)\) of real numbers.

Conversely, given any triplet \((x,y,z)\), we would first fix the point L on the \(x\)-axis corresponding to \(x\), then locate the point M in the XY-plane such that \((x,y)\) are the coordinates of the point M in the XY-plane. Note that LM is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis or is parallel to the \(y\)-axis. Having reached the point M, we draw a perpendicular MP to the XY-plane and locate on it the point P corresponding to \(z\). The point P so obtained has then the coordinates \((x,y,z)\). Thus, there is a one to one correspondence between the points in space and ordered triplet \((x,y,z)\) of real numbers.

Alternatively, through the point P in the space, we draw three planes parallel to the coordinate planes, meeting the \(x\)-axis, \(y\)-axis and \(z\)-axis in the points A, B and C, respectively (Fig 11.3). Let OA = \(x\), OB = \(y\) and OC = \(z\). Then, the point P will have the coordinates \(x,y\) and \(z\) and we write P \((x,y,z)\). Conversely, given \(x,y\) and \(z\), we locate the three points A, B and C on the three coordinate axes. Through the points A, B and C we draw planes parallel to the YZ-plane, ZX-plane and XY-plane, respectively. The point of interesection of these three planes, namely, ADPF, BDPE and CEPF is obviously the point P, corresponding to the ordered triplet \((x,y,z)\). We observe that if P \((x,y,z)\) is any point in the space, then \(x,y\) and \(z\) are perpendicular distances from YZ, ZX and XY planes, respectively.

The coordinates of the origin O are (0,0,0). The coordinates of any point on the \(x\)-axis will be as \((x,0,0)\) and the coordinates of any point in the YZ-plane will be as \((0,y,z)\).

The sign of the coordinates of a point determine the octant in which the point lies. The following table shows the signs of the coordinates in eight octants.

The following table shows the signs of the coordinates in eight octants.

**Example 1** In Fig 11.3, if P is (2,4,5), find the coordinates of F.

**Solution** For the point F, the distance measured along OY is zero. Therefore, the coordinates of F are (2,0,5).

**Example 2** Find the octant in which the points (-3,1,2) and (-3,1,- 2) lie.

**Solution** From the Table 11.1, the point (-3,1, 2) lies in second octant and the point (-3, 1, - 2) lies in octant VI.

**1.4 Distance between Two Points**

We have studied about the distance between two points in two-dimensional coordinate system. Let us now extend this study to three-dimensional system.

Let P(\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\), \(z_{1}\)) and Q (\(x_{2}\), \(y_{2}\), \(z_{2}\)) be two points referred to a system of rectangular axes' OX, OY and OZ. Through the points P and Q draw planes parallel to the coordinate planes so as to form a rectangular parallelopiped with one diagonal PQ (Fig 11.4).

Now, since \(\angle\)PAQ is a right

angle, it follows that, in triangle PAQ,

\[\text{PQ}^{2}=\text{PA}^{2}+\text{AQ}^{2}\]

\[\ldots \tag{1}\]

Also, triangle ANQ is right angle triangle with \(\angle\)ANQ a right angle.

Therefore \(\text{AQ}^{2}=\text{AN}^{2}+\text{NQ}^{2}\)... (2) From (1) and (2), we have

\[\text{PQ}^{2}=\text{PA}^{2}+\text{AN}^{2}+\text{NQ}^{2}\]

Now \(\text{PA}=y_{{}_{2}}-y_{{}_{1}}\), \(\text{AN}=x_{{}_{2}}-x_{{}_{1}}\) and \(\text{NQ}=z_{{}_{2}}-z_{{}_{1}}\) Hence \(\text{PQ}^{2}=(x_{{}_{2}}-x_{{}_{1}})^{2}+(y_{{}_{2}}-y_{{}_{1}})^{{}^{2}}+(z_ {{}_{2}}-z_{{}_{1}})^{2}\) Therefore \(\text{PQ}=\cdot\sqrt{(x_{{}_{2}}-x_{{}_{1}})^{2}+(y_{{}_{2}}-y_{{}_{1}})^{2}+ (z_{{}_{2}}-z_{{}_{1}})^{2}}\) This gives us the distance between two points \((x_{{}_{1}},y_{{}_{1}},z_{{}_{1}})\) and \((x_{{}_{2}},y_{{}_{2}},z_{{}_{2}})\).

In particular, if \(x_{{}_{1}}=y_{{}_{1}}=z_{{}_{1}}=0\), i.e., point P is origin O, then \(\text{OQ}=\sqrt{x_{{}_{2}}^{2}+y_{{}_{2}}^{2}+z_{{}_{2}}^{2}}\), which gives the distance between the origin O and any point Q \((x_{{}_{2}},y_{{}_{2}},z_{{}_{2}})\).

**Example 3**: Find the distance between the points P(1, -3, 4) and Q( -4, 1, 2).

**Solution**: The distance PQ between the points P(1, -3, 4) and Q( -4, 1, 2) is

\[\text{PQ} =\cdot\sqrt{(-4-1)^{2}+(1+3)^{2}+(2-4)^{2}}\] \[=\sqrt{25+16+4}\] \[=\cdot\sqrt{45}=3\sqrt{5}\text{units}\]

**Example 4**: Show that the points P(2, 3, 5), Q(1, 2, 3) and R (7, 0, -1) are collinear.

**Solution**: We know that points are said to be collinear if they lie on a line.

Now, \(\text{PQ}=\cdot\sqrt{(1+2)^{2}+(2-3)^{2}+(3-5)^{2}}=\sqrt{9+1+4}=\sqrt{14}\)

\[\text{QR}=\cdot\sqrt{(7-1)^{2}+(0-2)^{2}+(-1-3)^{2}}=\sqrt{36+4+16}=\sqrt{56}= 2\sqrt{14}\]

and \(\text{PR}=\cdot\sqrt{(7+\hat{2})^{2}+(0-3)^{2}+(-1-5)^{2}}=\sqrt{81+9+36}= \\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{CA}^{2}&=(3-25)^{2}+(6+41)^{2}+(9-5)^{2}\\ &=484+2209+16=2709\end{array}\]

We find that \(\text{CA}^{2}+\text{AB}^{2}\neq\text{BC}^{2}\).

Hence, the triangle ABC is not a right angled triangle.

**Example 6**: Find the equation of set of points P such that \(\text{PA}^{2}+\text{PB}^{2}=2k^{2}\), where A and B are the points \((3,\,4,\,5)\) and \((-1,\,3,-7)\), respectively.

**Solution**: Let the coordinates of point P be \((x,\,y,\,z)\).

Here \(\text{PA}^{2}=(x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}+(\,z-5)^{2}\)

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{PB}^{2}=(x+1)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}+(z+7)^{2}\end{array}\]

By the given condition \(\text{PA}^{2}+\text{PB}^{2}=2k^{2}\), we have

\[\begin{array}{ll}(x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}+(z-5)^{2}+(x+1)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}+(z+7)^{2} =2k^{2}\end{array}\]

i.e., \(2x^{2}+2y^{2}+2z^{2}-4x-14y+4z=2k^{2}-109\).

**1.**: Find the distance between the following pairs of points:

(i) \((2,\,3,\,5)\) and \((4,\,3,\,1)\) (ii) \((-3,\,7,\,2)\) and \((2,\,4,\,-1)\)

(iii) \((-1,\,3,\,-4)\) and \((1,\,-3,\,4)\) (iv) \((2,\,-1,\,3)\) and \((-2,\,1,\,3)\).
**2.**: Show that the points \((-2,\,3,\,5)\), \((1,\,2,\,3)\) and \((7,\,0,\,-1)\) are collinear.
**3.**: Verify the following:

(i) \((0,\,7,\,-10)\), \((1,\,6,\,-6)\) and \((4,\,9,\,-6)\) are the vertices of an isosceles triangle.

(ii) \((0,\,7,\,10)\), \((-1,\,6,\,6)\) and \((-4,\,9,\,6)\) are the vertices of a right angled triangle.

(iii) \((-1,\,2,\,1)\), \((1,\,-2,\,5)\), \((4,\,-7,\,8)\) and \((2,\,-3,\,4)\) are the vertices of a parallelogram.
**4.**: Find the equation of the set of points which are equidistant from the points \((1,\,2,\,3)\) and \((3,\,2,\,-1)\).
**5.**: Find the equation of the set of points P, the sum of whose distances from

A \((4,\,0,\,0)\) and B \((-4,\,0,\,0)\) is equal to \(10\).

**Miscellaneous Examples**

Example 7 Show that the points A \((1,\,2,\,3)\), B \((-1,\,-2,\,-1)\), C \((2,\,3,\,2)\) and D \((4,\,7,\,6)\) are the vertices of a parallelogram ABCD, but it is not a rectangle.

**Solution**: To show ABCD is a parallelogram we need to show opposite side are equal Note that.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{AB}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(-1-1\right)^{2}+\left(-2-2 \right)^{2}+\left(-1-3\right)^{2}}}\ =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{4+16+16}}=6\\ \text{BC}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(2+1\right)^{2}+\left(3+2\right)^{2}+ \left(2+1\right)^{2}}}\ =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{9+25+9}}\ =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{43}}\\ \text{CD}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(4-2\right)^{2}+\left(7-3\right)^{2}+ \left(6-2\right)^{2}}}\ =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{4+16+16}}=6\\ \text{DA}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(1-4\right)^{2}+\left(2-7\right)^{2}+ \left(3-6\right)^{2}}}\ =\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{9+25+9}=\sqrt{43}}\end{array}\]

Since AB \(=\) CD and BC \(=\) AD, ABCD is a parallelogram.

Now, it is required to prove that ABCD is not a rectangle. For this, we show that diagonals AC and BD are unequal. We have

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{AC}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(2-1\right)^{2}+ \left(3-2\right)^{2}+\left(2-3\right)^{2}}}\ =\sqrt{1+1+1}=\sqrt{3}\\ \text{BD}&=\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(4+1\right)^{2}+\left(7+2\right)^{2}+ \left(6+1\right)^{2}}}\ =\sqrt{25+81+49}=\sqrt{155}.\end{array}\]

Since AC \(\neq\) BD, ABCD is not a rectangle.

NoteWe can also show that ABCD is a parallelogram, using the property that diagonals AC and BD bisect each other.

**Example 8**: Find the equation of the set of the points P such that its distances from the points A (3, 4, -5) and B (- 2, 1, 4) are equal.

SolutionIf P (x,y,z) be any point such that PA \(=\) PB.

Now \(\overset{\cdot}{\sqrt{\left(x-3\right)^{2}+\left(y-4\right)^{2}+\left(z+5 \right)^{2}}}\ =\ \sqrt{\left(x+2\right)^{2}+\left(y-1\right)^{2}+\left(z-4\right)^{2}}\)

or \(\overset{\cdot}{\left(x-3\right)^{2}+\left(y-4\right)^{2}+\left(z+5\right)^{2}}\)\(=\ \left(x+2\right)^{2}+\left(y-1\right)^{2}+\left(z-4\right)^{2}\)

or \(10x+6y-18z-29=0\).

**Example 9**: The centroid of a triangle ABC is at the point (1, 1, 1). If the coordinates of A and B are (3, -5, 7) and (-1, 7, - 6), respectively, find the coordinates of the point C.

SolutionLet the coordinates of C be \(\left(x,y,z\right)\) and the coordinates of the centroid G be (1, 1, 1). Then\[\frac{x+3-1}{3}=1,\,\text{i.e.},\,\dot{x}=1;\,\frac{\dot{y-5+7}}{3}=1,\,\text{i.e.}, \,y=1;\,\frac{z+7-6}{3}=1,\,\text{i.e.},\,z=2.\] Hence, coordinates of C are \((1,\,1,\,2)\).

\[\text{{Miscellaneous}}\text{{Exercise on Chapter 11}}\]

* Distance between two points P\((x_{1},\,y_{1},\,z_{1})\) and Q \((x_{2},\,y_{2},\,z_{2})\) is given by \(\dot{\text{PQ}}=\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1}\,)^{2}+(\,y_{2}-y_{1}\,)^{2}+(\,z_{2}-z_{1 }\,)^{2}}\)

### Historical Note

Rene' Descartes (1596-1650), the father of analytical geometry, essentially dealt with plane geometry only in 1637. The same is true of his co-inventor Pierre Fermat (1601-1665) and La Hire (1640-1718). Although suggestions for the three dimensional coordinate geometry can be found in their works but no details. Descartes had the idea of coordinates in three dimensions but did not develop it. J.Bernoulli (1667-1748) in a letter of 1715  to Leibnitz introduced the three coordinate planes which we use today. It was Antoinne Parent (1666-1716), who gave a systematic development of analytical solid geometry for the first time in a paper presented to the French Academy in 1700. L.Euler (1707-1783) took up systematically the three dimensional coordinate geometry, in Chapter 5 of the appendix to the second volume of his "Introduction to Geometry" in 1748. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that geometry was extended to more than three dimensions, the well-known application of which is in the Space-Time Continuum of Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

### 1.1 Introduction

This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that branch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study of change in the value of a function as the points in the domain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative (without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come back to a definition of derivative and study some algebra of derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain standard functions.

### 1.2 Intuitive Idea of Derivatives

Physical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped from a tall cliff covers a distance of \(4.9t^{2}\) metres in \(t\) seconds, i.e., distance \(s\) in metres covered by the body as a function of time \(t\) in seconds is given by \(s=4.9t^{2}\).

The adjoining Table 1.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals of time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff.

The objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time \(t=2\) seconds from this data. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various intervals of time ending at \(t=2\) seconds and hope that these throw some light on the velocity at \(t=2\) seconds.

Average velocity between \(t=t_{1}\) and \(t=t_{2}\) equals distance travelled between \(t=t_{t}\) and \(t=t_{2}\) seconds divided by \((t_{2}-t_{1})\). Hence the average velocity in the first two seconds\[=\frac{\dot{\text{Distance travelled between }t_{2}=2\text{ and }t_{1}=0}}{\text{Time interval }(t_{2}-t_{1})}\] \[=\frac{\dot{\text{(19.6-0)}m}}{\text{(2-0)}s}=9.8\,m/s\.\]

Similarly, the average velocity between \(t=1\) and \(t=2\) is

\[\frac{\dot{\text{(19.6-4.9)}m}}{\text{(2-1)}s}=14.7\ m/s\]

Likewise we compute the average velocitiy between \(t=t_{1}\) and \(t=2\) for various \(t_{1}\). The following Table 13.2 gives the average velocity \((v)\), \(t=t_{1}\) seconds and \(t=2\) seconds.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline t_{1}&0&1&1,5&1.8&1.9&1.95&1.99\\ \hline v&9.8&14.7&17.15&18,62&19.11&19.355&19.551\\ \hline\end{array}\]

From Table 12.2, we observe that the average velocity is gradually increasing. As we make the time intervals ending at \(t=2\) smaller, we see that we get a better idea of the velocity at \(t=2\). Hoping that nothing really dramatic happens between \(1.99\) seconds and \(2\) seconds, we conclude that the average velocity at \(t=2\) seconds is just above \(19.551m/s\).

This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the following set of computation. Compute the average velocities for various time intervals starting at \(t=2\) seconds. As before the average velocity \(v\) between \(t=2\) seconds and \(t=t_{2}\) seconds is

\[=\frac{\dot{\text{Distance travelled between 2 seconds and }t_{2}\text{ seconds}}}{t_{2}-2}\] \[=\frac{\dot{\text{Distance travelled in }t_{2}\text{ seconds }-\text{ Distance travelled in }2\text{ seconds}}}{t_{2}-2}\]\[=\frac{\dot{\text{Distance travelled in }t_{2}\text{ seconds }-19.6}}{t_{2}-2}\]

The following Table 12.3 gives the average velocity \(v\) in metres per second between \(t=2\) seconds and \(t_{2}\) seconds.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline t_{2}&4&3&2.5&2.2&2.1&2.05&2.01\\ \hline v&29.4&24.5&22.05&20.58&20.09&19.845&19.649\\ \hline\end{array}\]

**Table 12.3**

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline t_{2}&4&3&2.5&2.2&2.1&2.05&2.01\\ \hline v&29.4&24.5&22.05&20.58&20.09&19.845&19.649\\ \hline\end{array}\]

Here again we note that if we take smaller time intervals starting at \(t\equiv 2\), we get better idea of the velocity at \(t=2\).

In the first set of computations, what we have done is to find average velocities in increasing time intervals ending at \(t=2\) and then hope that nothing dramatic happens just before \(t=2\). In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities decreasing in time intervals ending at \(t=2\) and then hope that nothing dramatic happens just after \(t=2\). Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average velocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of the body at \(t=2\) is between \(19.551m/s\) and \(19.649\)\(m/s\). Technically, we say that the instantaneous velocity at \(t=2\) is between \(19.551\)\(m/s\) and \(19.649\)\(m/s\). As is well-known, _velocity is the rate of change of displacement_. Hence what we have accomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time instants we have estimated the rate of change of the distance at a given instant of time. We say that the _derivative_ of the distance function \(s=4.9t^{2}\) at \(t=2\) is between \(19.551\) and \(19.649\).

An alternate way of viewing this limiting process is shown in Fig 12.1. This is a plot of distance \(s\) of the body from the top of the cliff versus the time \(t\) elapsed. In the limit as the sequence of time intervals \(h_{1}\), \(h_{2}\),..., approaches zero, the sequence of average velocities approaches the same limit as does the sequence of ratios\[\frac{\dot{C}_{1}B_{1}}{AC_{1}},\frac{C_{2}B_{2}}{AC_{2}},\ \frac{C_{3}B_{3}}{AC_{3}},...\]

where \(C_{1}B_{1}=s_{1}-s_{0}\) is the distance travelled by the body in the time interval \(h_{1}=AC_{1}\), etc. From the Fig 12.1 it is safe to conclude that this latter sequence approaches the slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. In other words, the instantaneous velocity \(v(t)\) of a body at time \(t=2\) is equal to the slope of the tangent of the curve \(s=4.9t^{2}\) at \(t=2\).

### Limits

The above discussion clearly points towards the fact that we need to understand limiting process in greater clarity. We study a few illustrative examples to gain some familiarity with the concept of limits.

Consider the function \(f(x)=x^{2}\). Observe that as \(x\) takes values very close to \(0\), the value of \(f(x)\) also moves towards \(0\) (See Fig 2.10 Chapter 2). We say

\[\lim_{x\to 0}f(\bar{x})=0\]

(to be read as limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) tends to zero equals zero). The limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) tends to zero is to be thought of as the value \(f(x)\) should assume at \(x=0\).

In general as \(x\to a,f(x)\to l\), then \(l\) is called _limit of the function_\(f(x)\) which is symbolically written as \(\lim_{x\to a}f\left(\bar{x}\right)=l\).

Consider the following function \(g(x)=|\bar{x}|,x\neq 0\). Observe that \(g(0)\) is not defined. Computing the value of \(g(x)\) for values of \(x\) very near to \(0\), we see that the value of \(g(x)\) moves towards \(0\). So, \(\lim_{x\to 0}g(x)=0\). This is intuitively clear from the graph of \(y=|x|\) for \(x\neq 0\). (See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).

Consider the following function.

\[h(x)=\frac{x^{2}-4}{x-2},\ x\neq 2\.\]

Compute the value of \(h(x)\) for values of \(x\) very near to \(2\) (but not at \(2\)). Convince yourself that all these values are near to \(4\). This is somewhat strengthened by considering the graph of the function \(y=h(x)\) given here (Fig 12.2).

In all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given point \(x=a\) did not really depend on how is \(x\) tending to \(a\). Note that there are essentially two ways \(x\) could approach a number \(a\) either from left or from right, i.e., all the values of \(x\) near \(a\) could be less than \(a\) or could be greater than \(a\). This naturally leads to two limits - the _right hand limit_ and the _left hand limit_. _Right hand limit_ of a function \(f(x)\) is that value of \(f(x)\) which is dictated by the values of \(f(x)\) when \(x\) tends to \(a\) from the right. Similarly, the _left hand limit_. To illustrate this, consider the function \(\cdot\).

Graph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is clear that the value of \(f\) at \(0\) dictated by values of \(f(x)\) with \(x\leq 0\) equals \(1\), i.e., the left hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(0\) is

Similarly, the value of \(f\) at \(0\) dictated by values of \(f(x)\) with \(x>0\) equals \(2\), i.e., the right hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(0\) is

\[\cdot\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)\equiv 2\]

In this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at \(0\)).

We say \(\cdot\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\) is the expected value of \(f\) at \(x=a\) given the values of \(f\) near \(x\) to the left of \(a\). This value is called the _left hand limit_ of \(f\) at \(a\).

We say \(\cdot\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\) is the expected value of \(f\) at \(x=a\) given the values of \(f\) near \(x\) to the right of \(a\). This value is called the _right hand limit_ of \(f(x)\) at \(a\).

If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x=a\) and denote it by \(\cdot\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\).

Consider the function \(f(x)=x+10\). We want to find the limit of this function at \(x=5\). Let us compute the value of the function \(f(x)\) for \(x\) very near to \(5\). Some of the points near and to the left of \(5\) are \(4.9\), \(4.95\), \(4.99\), \(4.995\)\(\ldots\), etc. Values of the function at these points are tabulated below. Similarly, the real number \(5.001\)5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points are also given in the Table 12.4.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline x&4.9&4.95&4.99&4.995&5.001&5.01&5.1\\ \hline f(x)&14.9&14.95&14.99&14.995&15.001&15.01&15.1\\ \hline\end{array}\]

From the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of \(f(x)\) at \(x=5\) should be greater than 14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between \(x=\)4.995 and 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the \(f(x)\) at \(x=5\) as dictated by the numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e.,

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 5}\ \ f(x)=15\.\end{array}\]

Similarly, when \(x\) approaches 5 from the right, \(f(x)\) should be taking value 15, i.e.,

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 5}\ f(x)=15\.\end{array}\]

Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of \(f(x)\) and the right hand limit of \(f(x)\) are both equal to 15. Thus,

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 5^{-}}\ f(x)=\lim_{x\to 5^{-}}\ f(x)=\lim_{x\to 5}\ f(x)=15\.\end{array}\]

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we note that as \(x\) approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function \(f(x)=x+10\) approaches the point (5, 15).

We observe that the value of the function at \(x=5\) also happens to be equal to 15.

**Illustration 2**: Consider the function \(f(x)=x^{3}\). Let us try to find the limit of this function at \(x=1\). Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x\) near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline x&0.9&0.99&0.999&1.001&1.01&1.1\\ \hline f(x)&0.729&0.970299&0.99700299&1.003003001&1.030301&1.331\\ \hline\end{array}\]

From this table, we deduce that value of \(f(x)\) at \(x=1\) should be greater than 0.997002999 and less than 1.003003001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:223]

value (3, in this case) everywhere, i.e., its value at points close to 2 is 3. Hence

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 2}f\left(x\right)}=\lim_{x\to 2^{*}}f\left(x\right)=\lim_{x\to 2}f\left(x \right)=3\]

Graph of \(f(x)=3\) is anyway the line parallel to \(x\)-axis passing through (0, 3) and is shown in Fig 2.9, Chapter 2. From this also it is clear that the required limit is 3. In fact, it is easily observed that \(\dot{\lim_{x\to a}f\left(x\right)}=3\) for any real number \(a\).

**Illustration 5** Consider the function \(f(x)=x^{2}+x\). We want to find \(\dot{\lim_{x\to 1}f\left(x\right)}\). We tabulate the values of \(f(x)\) near \(x=1\) in Table 12.7.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline x&0.9&0.99&0.999&1.01&1.1&1.2\\ \hline f(x)&1.71&1.9701&1.997001&2.0301&2.31&2.64\\ \hline\end{array}\]

From this it is reasonable to deduce that

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 1^{*}}f\left(x\right)}=\lim_{x\to 1^{*}}f\left(x\right)=\lim_{x \to 1}f\left(x\right)=2\]

From the graph of \(f(x)=x^{2}+x\) shown in the Fig 12.5, it is clear that as \(x\) approaches 1, the graph approaches (1, 2).

Here, again we observe that the

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 1}f\left(x\right)}=f(1)\]

Now, convince yourself of the

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 1}x^{2}}=1,\ \ \lim_{x\to 1}x=1\text{ and }\lim_{x\to 1}x+1=2\]

Then

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 1}x^{2}}+\ \ \lim_{x\to 1}x=1+1=2=\lim_{x\to 1}\left[x^{2}+x \right].\]

Also

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 1}x}.\ \ \lim_{x\to 1}\left(x+1\right)=1.2=2=\lim_{x\to 1}\left[x \left(x+1\right)\right]=\lim_{x\to 1}\left[x^{2}+x\right].\]

**Illustration 6** Consider the function \(f(x)=\sin\,x\). We are interested in \(\lim\limits_{x\to\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin\,x\), where the angle is measured in radians.

Here, we tabulate the (approximate) value of \(f(x)\) near \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) (Table 12.8). From this, we may deduce that

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to\frac{\pi}{2}}f\left(x\right)=\lim\limits_{x\to\frac {\pi}{2}}f\left(x\right)=\lim\limits_{x\to\frac{\pi}{2}}f\left(x\right)=1.\]

Further, this is supported by the graph of \(f(x)=\sin\,x\) which is given in the Fig 3.8 (Chapter 3). In this case too, we observe that \(\lim\limits_{x\to\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin\,x=1\).

**Illustration 7** Consider the function \(f(x)=x+\cos\,x\). We want to find the \(\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)\). Here we tabulate the (approximate) value of \(f(x)\) near \(0\) (Table 12.9).

**Table 12.9**

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline x&-0.1&-0.01&-0.001&0.001&0.01&0.1\\ \hline f(x)&0.9850&0.98995&0.9989995&1.000995&1.00995&1.0950\\ \hline\end{array}\]

From the Table 13.9, we may deduce that

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f\left(x\right)=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f\left(x \right)=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f\left(x\right)=1\]

In this case too, we observe that \(\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=f\left(0\right)=1\). Now, can you convince yourself that

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}\left[x+\cos x\right]=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}x+\lim \limits_{x\to 0}\cos x\ \ \mbox{is indeed true?}\]

**Illustration 8** Consider the function \(f\big{(}x\big{)}=\frac{1}{x^{2}}\) for \(x>0\). We want to know \(\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{x\to 0}f(x)\).

Here, observe that the domain of the function is given to be all positive real numbers. Hence, when we tabulate the values of \(f(x)\), it does not make sense to talk of \(x\) approaching \(0\) from the left. Below we tabulate the values of the function for positive \(x\) close to \(0\) (in this table \(n\) denotes any positive integer).

From the Table 12.10 given below, we see that as \(x\) tends to \(0,f(x)\) becomes larger and larger. What we mean here is that the value of \(f(x)\) may be made larger than any given number.

**Table 12.10**

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(1\) & \(0.1\) & \(0.01\) \\ \hline \(f(x)\) & \(1\) & \(100\) & \(10000\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} Mathematically, we say

\[\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{x\to 0}f\big{(}x\big{)}=+\infty\]

We also remark that we will not come across such limits in this course.

**Illustration 9** We want to find \(\underset{x\to 0}{\lim}f\big{(}x\big{)}\), where

\[f\big{(}x\big{)}=\begin{pmatrix}x-2,&x<0\\ 0&x=0\\ x+2,&x>0\end{pmatrix}\]

As usual we make a table of \(x\) near \(0\) with \(f(x)\). Observe that for negative values of \(x\) we need to evaluate \(x-2\) and for positive values, we need to evaluate \(x+2\).

**Table 12.11**

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(-0.1\) & \(-0.01\) & \(-0.001\) & \(0.001\) & \(0.01\) & \(0.1\) \\ \hline \(f(x)\) & \(-2.1\) & \(-2.01\) & \(-2.001\) & \(2.001\) & \(2.01\) & \(2.1\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the first three entries of the Table 12.11, we deduce that the value of the function is decreasing to \(-2\) and hence.

\[\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{x\to 0^{\cdot}}f\big{(}x\big{)}=-2\]From the last three entires of the table we deduce that the value of the function is increasing from \(2\) and hence

\[\lim_{x\to 0^{+}}f\left(x\right)=2\]

Since the left and right hand limits at \(0\) do not coincide, we say that the limit of the function at \(0\) does not exist.

Graph of this function is given in the Fig12.6. Here, we remark that the value of the function at \(x=0\) is well defined and is, indeed, equal to \(0\), but the limit of the function at \(x=0\) is not even defined.

**Illustration 10**: As a final illustration, we find \(\lim_{x\to 1}f\left(x\right),\) where

\[f\left(x\right)=\left\{x+2\right.\left.x\neq 1\right\}\]

As usual we tabulate the values of \(f(x)\) for \(x\) near \(1\). From the values of \(f(x)\) for \(x\) less than \(1\), it seems that the function should take value \(3\) at \(x=1.\), i.e.,

\[\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}f\left(x\right)=3\.\]

Similarly, the value of \(f(x)\) should be \(3\) as dictated by values of \(f(x)\) at \(x\) greater than \(1\). i.e.

\[\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}f\left(x\right)=3\.\]

But then the left and right hand limits coincide and hence

\[\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}f\left(x\right)=\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}f\left(x\right)=\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}f\left(x\right)=3\.\]

Graph of function given in Fig 12.7 strengthens our deduction about the limit. Here, we 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:228]

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}x^{2}=\lim_{x\to a}\left(x.x\right)=\lim_{x\to a}x. \lim_{x\to a}x=a.\ a=a^{2}\]

An easy exercise in induction on \(n\) tells us that

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}x^{n}=a^{n}\]

Now, let \(\dot{f}\left(x\right)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+...+a_{n}x^{n}\) be a polynomial function. Thinking of each of \(a_{0},a_{1}x,a_{2}x^{2},...,a_{n}x^{n}\) as a function, we have

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}f\left(x\right) =\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}\left[a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+...+a_{n}x^{n}\right]\] \[\mathop{\cdot}\limits_{x\to a}a_{0}+\lim_{x\to a}a_{1}x+\lim_{x\to a}a_{ 2}x^{2}+...+\lim_{x\to a}a_{n}x^{n}\] \[\mathop{\cdot}\limits_{x\to a}a_{0}+a_{1}\lim_{x\to a}x+a_{2}\mathop{ \lim}\limits_{x\to a}x^{2}+...+a_{n}\lim_{x\to a}x^{n}\] \[=\mathop{\cdot}\limits_{a_{0}}+a_{1}a+a_{2}a^{2}+...+a_{n}a^{n}\] \[=\mathop{\cdot}\limits_{f}\left(a\right)\]

(Make sure that you understand the justification for each step in the above!)

\[\mathop{\cdot}\limits_{x\to a}\dot{f}\left(x\right)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x \to a}\frac{g\left(x\right)}{h\left(x\right)}=\frac{\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x \to a}g\left(x\right)}{\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}h\left(x\right)}=\frac{g \left(a\right)}{h\left(a\right)}\]

However, if \(h(a)=0\), there are two scenarios - (i) when \(g(a)\neq 0\) and (ii) when \(g(a)=0\). In the former case we say that the limit does not exist. In the latter case we can write \(\dot{g}(x)=(x-a)^{k}g_{1}\left(x\right)\), where \(k\) is the maximum of powers of \((x-a)\) in \(g(x)\) Similarly, \(h(x)=(x-a)^{l}h_{1}\left(x\right)\) as \(h\left(a\right)=0\). Now, if \(k>l\), we have

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}f\left(x\right)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{\frac{x \to a}{x\to a}g\left(x\right)}{\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to a}h\left(x\right)}= \mathop{\lim}\limits_{\frac{x\to a}{x\to a}\left(x-a\right)^{k}g_{1}\left(x \right)}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:230]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:231]

5. First, we rewrite the function as a rational function. \[\dot{\left[\frac{x-2}{x^{2}-x}-\frac{1}{x^{3}-3x^{2}+2x}\right]} =\dot{\left[\frac{x-2}{x\left(x-1\right)}-\frac{1}{x\left(x^{2}-3x +2\right)}\right]}\] \[=\dot{\left[\frac{x-2}{x\left(x-1\right)}-\frac{1}{x\left(x-1 \right)\left(x-2\right)}\right]}\] \[=\dot{\left[\frac{x^{2}-4x+4-1}{x\left(x-1\right)\left(x-2\right)} \right]}\] \[\quad.\] \[=\frac{x^{2}-4x+3}{x\left(x-1\right)\left(x-2\right)}\]

Evaluating the function at \(1\), we get it of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\). \[\begin{split}\text{Hence}&\lim_{x\to 1}\left[\frac{x^{2}-2}{x^{2}-x} \right]\underbrace{\frac{x^{2}-2}{x^{3}-3x^{2}+2x}}&=\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{x^{2}-4x+3}{x\left(x-1\right)\left(x-2\right)}\\ &=\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{\left(x-3\right)\left(x-1\right)}{x\left(x-1 \right)\left(x-2\right)}\\ &\quad.\\ &=\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x-3}{x\left(x-2\right)}=\frac{1-3}{1 \left(1-2\right)}=2.\end{split}\]

We remark that we could cancel the term \(\left(x-1\right)\) in the above evaluation because \(x\neq 1\).

Evaluation of an important limit which will be used in the sequel is given as a theorem below.

**Theorem 2**. For any positive integer \(n\),

\[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}=na^{n-1}.\]

\(Remark\) The expression in the above theorem for the limit is true even if \(n\) is any rational number and \(a\) is positive.

Proof Dividing \((x^{n}-a^{n})\) by \((x-a)\), we see that

\[\begin{array}{l}x^{n}-a^{n}=(x\!-\!a)\ (x^{n\!-\!1}+x^{n\!-\!2}\,a\,+\,x^{n\!-\!3} \ a^{2}\,+\,...\,+x\ a^{n\!-\!2}\,+\,a^{n\!-\!1})\\ \cdot\\ \cdot\end{array}\]

Thus, \(\lim_{x\to a}\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}=\lim_{x\to a}\,(x^{n\!-\!1}+x^{n\!-\!2}\,a \,+\,x^{n\!-\!3}\ a^{2}\,+\,...\,+x\ a^{n\!-\!2}\,+\,a^{n\!-\!1})\)

\[\begin{array}{l}=a^{n\!-\!1}+\ a\ a^{n\!-\!2}+\,.\.\.\ +\ a^{n\!-\!2}\ (a)\ +a^{n\!-\!1}\\ =a^{n\!-\!1}+\ a^{n\!-\!1}+...+a^{n\!-\!1}+\ a^{n\!-\!1}\ (n\ {\rm terms})\\ \cdot\\ =\,na^{n\!-\!1}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x^{15}-1}{x^{10}-1}=\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x^{15}-1}{x-1}+ \frac{x^{10}-1}{x-1}\end{array}\]

Further, since \(\lim_{x\to 0}\ \cos\ x=1\), we see that the proof of (i) of the theorem is complete by sandwich theorem.

To prove (ii), we recall the trigonometric identity \(1-\cos x=2\ \sin^{2}\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\). Then

\[\cdot\] \[\lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{1-\cos x}{x} = \lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{2\sin^{2}\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{x} =\lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{\sin\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\frac{x}{2}} \!.\sin\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\] \[\cdot\] \[= \lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{\sin\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\frac{x}{2}} \!.\lim_{x\to 0}\!\sin\!\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=1.0=0\]

Observe that we have implicitly used the fact that \(x\to 0\) is equivalent to \(\frac{x}{2}\to 0\). This may be justified by putting \(y=\frac{x}{2}\).

**Example 4** Evaluate: (i) \(\lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{\sin 4x}{\sin 2x}\) (ii) \(\lim_{x\to 0}\!\frac{\tan x}{x}\)

\[\cdot\] \[= 2.\lim_{x\to 0}\!\!\left[\frac{\sin 4x}{4x}\right]\!+\!\left[\frac{ \sin 2x}{2x}\right]\] \[\cdot\] \[= 2.\lim_{4x\to 0}\!\!\left[\frac{\sin 4x}{4x}\right]\!+\!\lim_{2x \to 0}\!\!\left[\frac{\sin 2x}{2x}\right]\] \[= 2.1.1=2\ (\text{as}\ x\to 0,\ 4x\to 0\ \text{and}\ 2x\to 0)\](ii) We have \(\underset{x\to 0}{\lim}\dfrac{\tan x}{x}\ =\ \underset{x\to 0}{\lim}\dfrac{\sin x}{x\cos x}\ =\underset{x\to 0}{\lim}\dfrac{\sin x}{x}\cdot \underset{x\to 0}{\lim}\dfrac{1}{\cos x}\ =1.1=1\) A general rule that needs to be kept in mind while evaluating limits is the following.

Say, given that the limit \(\underset{x\to a}{\lim}\dfrac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)}\) exists and we want to evaluate this. First we check the value of \(f(a)\) and \(g(a)\). If both are \(0\), then we see if we can get the factor which is causing the terms to vanish, i.e., see if we can write \(f(x)=f_{1}\ (x)\ f_{2}(x)\) so that \(f_{1}\ (a)=0\) and \(f_{2}\ (a)\neq 0\). Similarly, we write \(g(x)=g_{1}\ (x)\ g_{2}(x)\), where \(g_{1}(a)=0\) and \(g_{2}(a)\neq 0\). Cancel out the common factors from \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) (if possible) and write

\[\dfrac{\overset{\cdot}{f\left(x\right)}}{g\left(x\right)}=\dfrac{p \left(x\right)}{q\left(x\right)}\,\ \text{where}\ q(x)\neq 0.\] \[\cdot\] Then \[\underset{x\to a}{\lim}\dfrac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)}=\dfrac{p \left(a\right)}{q\left(a\right)}\.\]

### Derivatives

We have seen in the Section 13.2, that by knowing the position of a body at various time intervals it is possible to find the rate at which the position of the body is changing. It is of very general interest to know a certain parameter at various instants of time and try to finding the rate at which it is changing. There are several real life situations where such a process needs to be carried out. For instance, people maintaining a reservoir need to know when will a reservoir overflow knowing the depth of the water at several instances of time, Rocket Scientists need to compute the precise velocity with which the satellite needs to be shot out from the rocket knowing the height of the rocket at various times. Financial institutions need to predict the changes in the value of a particular stock knowing its present value. In these, and many such cases it is desirable to know how a particular parameter is changing with respect to some other parameter. The heart of the matter is derivative of a function at a given point in its domain of definition.

**Definition 1**.: _Suppose \(f\) is a real valued function and \(a\) is a point in its domain of definition. The derivative of \(f\) at \(a\) is defined by_

\[\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\left(a+h\right)-f\left(a\right)}{h}\]

_provided this limit exists. Derivative of \(f(x)\) at \(a\) is denoted by \(f(a)\)._

Observe that\(f^{\prime}(a)\) quantifies the change in \(f(x)\) at \(a\) with respect to \(x\).

**Example 5**.: Find the derivative at \(x=2\) of the function \(f(x)=3x\).

**Solution** We have

\[f^{\prime}(2) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\left(2+h\right)-f\left(2\right)}{h}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{3\left(2+h\right)-3\left(2\right)}{h}\] \[\cdot\] \[= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{6+3h-6}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{3h}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}3=3.\]

The derivative of the function \(3x\) at \(x=2\) is \(3\).

**Example 6**.: Find the derivative of the function \(f(x)=2x^{2}+3x-5\) at \(x=-1\). Also prove that \(f^{\prime}\left(0\right)+3f^{\prime}\left(-1\right)=0\).

**Solution** We first find the derivatives of \(f(x)\) at \(x=-1\) and at \(x=0\). We have

\[f^{\prime}\left(-1\right) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\left(-1+h\right)-f\left(-1\right)}{h}\] \[\cdot\] \[= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2h^{2}-h}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\left(2h-1\right)=2\left(0\right)-1=-1\]

and

\[f^{\prime}\left(0\right) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\left(0+h\right)-f\left(0\right)}{h}\] \[\cdot\] \[= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\left[2\left(0+h\right)^{2}+3\left(0+h\right)-5 \right]-\left[2\left(0\right)^{2}+3\left(0\right)-5\right]}{h}\]\[=\ \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2h^{2}+3h}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\bigl{(}2h+3\bigr{)}=2 \bigl{(}0\bigr{)}+3=3\]

Clearly \(\qquad\dot{f}^{*}\bigl{(}0\bigr{)}+3f^{*}\bigl{(}-1\bigr{)}=0\)

_Remark_: At this stage note that evaluating derivative at a point involves effective use of various rules, limits are subjected to. The following illustrates this.

**Example 7**: Find the derivative of \(\sin x\) at \(x=0\).

**Solution** Let \(f(x)=\sin x\). Then

\[f^{*}(0) =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\bigl{(}0+h\bigr{)}-f\bigl{(}0\bigr{)}}{h}\] \[\qquad\cdot\]

**Example 8**: Find the derivative of \(f(x)=3\) at \(x=0\) and at \(x=3\).

**Solution** Since the derivative measures the change in function, intuitively it is clear that the derivative of the constant function must be zero at every point. This is indeed, supported by the following computation.

\[\dot{f}^{*}\bigl{(}0\bigr{)}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\bigl{(}0+h\bigr{)}-f \bigl{(}0\bigr{)}}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{3-3}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{0}{h}=0\.\]

Similarly \(\qquad\dot{f}^{*}\bigl{(}3\bigr{)}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\bigl{(}3+h\bigr{)}-f \bigl{(}3\bigr{)}}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{3-3}{h}=0\.\)

We now present a geometric interpretation of derivative of a function at a point: Let \(y=f(x)\) be a function and let \(\mathbb{P}=(a,f(a))\) and \(\mathbb{Q}=(a+h,f(a+h))\) be two points close to each other on the graph of this function. The Fig 12.11 is now self explanatory.

**Fig 12.11**:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:242]

\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{10\big{(}x+h\big{)}-10\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{10h}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\big{(}10\big{)}=10\,.\]

**Example 10**: Find the derivative of \(f(x)=x^{2}\).

Solution We have,\(f^{\prime}(x)\ =\ \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\)

\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\big{(}x+h\big{)}^{2}-\big{(}x\big{)}^{2}}{h}\,= \lim_{h\to 0}\big{(}h+2x\big{)}=2x\]

**Example 11**: Find the derivative of the constant function \(f(x)=a\) for a fixed real number \(a\).

Solution We have,\(f^{\prime}(x)=\ \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\)

\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a-a}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{0}{h}=0\ \ \text{as}\ h\neq 0\]

**Example 12**: Find the derivative of \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\)

Solution We have \(f^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\)

\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\Bigg{[}\frac{x-\big{(}x+h\big{)}}{x \big{(}x+h\big{)}}\Bigg{]}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\Bigg{[}\frac{-h}{x\big{(}x+h\big{)}} \Bigg{]}\hskip 28.452756pt=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{-1}{x\big{(}x+h\big{)}}=-\frac{1}{x^{2}}\]

#### 12.5.1 Algebra of derivative of functions

Since the very definition of derivatives involve limits in a rather direct fashion, we expect the rules for derivatives to follow closely that of limits. We collect these in the following theorem.

**Theorem 5** Let \(f\) and \(g\) be two functions such that their derivatives are defined in a common domain. Then

1. Derivative of sum of two functions is sum of the derivatives of the functions. \[\dot{\frac{d}{dx}}\big{[}f\big{(}x\big{)}+g\big{(}x\big{)}\big{]}=\frac{d}{dx}f \big{(}x\big{)}+\frac{d}{dx}g\big{(}x\big{)}\,.\]
2. Derivative of difference of two functions is difference of the derivatives of the functions. \[\dot{\frac{d}{dx}}\big{[}f\big{(}x\big{)}-g\big{(}x\big{)}\big{]}=\frac{d}{dx} f\big{(}x\big{)}-\frac{d}{dx}g\big{(}x\big{)}\,.\]
3. Derivative of product of two functions is given by the following _product rule_. \[\dot{\frac{d}{dx}}\big{[}f\big{(}x\big{)}\cdot g\big{(}x\big{)}\big{]}=\frac{d }{dx}f\big{(}x\big{)}\cdot g\big{(}x\big{)}+f\big{(}x\big{)}\cdot\frac{d}{dx} g\big{(}x\big{)}\]
4. Derivative of quotient of two functions is given by the following _quotient rule_ (whenever the denominator is non-zero). \[\frac{d}{dx}\bigg{(}\frac{f\big{(}x\big{)}}{g\big{(}x\big{)}}\bigg{)}=\frac{d }{dx}\dot{f}\big{(}x\big{)}\cdot g\big{(}x\big{)}-\ f\big{(}x\big{)}\ \ \frac{d}{dx}g\big{(}x\big{)}\]

The proofs of these follow essentially from the analogous theorem for limits. We will not prove these here. As in the case of limits this theorem tells us how to compute derivatives of special types of functions. The last two statements in the theorem may be restated in the following fashion which aids in recalling them easily:

Let \(u=f\big{(}x\big{)}\) and \(v=g\big{(}x\big{)}\). Then

\[\dot{\big{(}uv\big{)}}^{\prime}=\dot{u}^{\prime}v+uv^{\prime}\]

This is referred to a Leibnitz rule for differentiating product of functions or the product rule. Similarly, the quotient rule is\[\cdot\]

\[\left(\frac{u}{v}\right)^{\prime}=\frac{\cdot\cdot\cdot u^{\prime}v-uv^{\prime}}{v^{ 2}}\]

Now, let us tackle derivatives of some standard functions.

It is easy to see that the derivative of the function \(f(x)=x\) is the constant function \(1\). This is because \(f^{\prime}\big{(}x\big{)}=\,\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x \big{)}}{h}\,=\,\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{x+h-x}{h}\)

\[=\,\lim_{h\to 0}1=1\,\,.\]

We use this and the above theorem to compute the derivative of \(f(x)=10x=x+....+x\) (ten terms). By \((i)\) of the above theorem

\[\cdot\frac{df(x)}{dx} =\,\frac{d}{dx}\,\cdot\,\Big{(}x+...+x\Big{)}\,\,\,\text{( ten terms)}\] \[=\,\frac{\cdot\cdot\cdot}{dx}x^{+}...+\frac{d}{dx}x\,\,\,\,\text{ ( ten terms)}\] \[=1+...+1\,\,\text{( ten terms)}=10.\]

We note that this limit may be evaluated using product rule too. Write \(f(x)=10x=uv\), where \(u\) is the constant function taking value \(10\) everywhere and \(v(x)=x\). Here, \(f(x)=10x=uv\) we know that the derivative of \(u\) equals \(0\). Also derivative of \(v(x)=x\) equals \(1\). Thus by the product rule we have

\[f^{\prime}\big{(}x\big{)}=\big{(}10x\big{)}^{\prime}=\big{(}uv\big{)}^{\prime }=u^{\prime}v+uv^{\prime}=0.x+10.1=10\]

On similar lines the derivative of \(f(x)=x^{2}\) may be evaluated. We have \(f(x)=x^{2}=x\,\,.x\) and hence

\[\cdot\frac{df}{dx} =\,\frac{d}{dx}\big{(}x.x\big{)}=\frac{d}{dx}\big{(}x\big{)}.x+x. \frac{d}{dx}\big{(}x\big{)}\] \[=\,1.x+x.1=2x\,\,.\]

More generally, we have the following theorem.

**Theorem 6**: Derivative of \(f(x)=x^{n}\) is \(nx^{n-1}\) for any positive integer \(n\).

**Proof** By definition of the derivative function, we have

\[f^{\prime}\big{(}x\big{)}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x \big{)}}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\big{(}x+h\big{)}^{n}-x^{n}}{h}\,.\]Binomial theorem tells that \((x+h)^{n}=\left({}^{n}C_{0}\right)x^{n}+\left({}^{n}C_{1}\right)x^{n-1}h+...+ \left({}^{n}C_{n}\right)h^{n}\) and hence \((x+h)^{n}-x^{n}=h(nx^{n-1}+...+h^{n-1})\). Thus

\[\begin{array}{rl}\frac{df(x)}{dx}&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\left(x+h \right)^{n}-x^{n}}{h}\\ &\cdot\\ &=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h\left(nx^{n-1}+....+h^{n-1}\right)}{h}\\ &\cdot\\ &=\lim_{h\to 0}\left(nx^{n-1}+...+h^{n-1}\right)=\overset{\cdot}{n}x^{n-1}. \end{array}\]

Alternatively, we may also prove this by induction on \(n\) and the product rule as follows. The result is true for \(n=1\), which has been proved earlier. We have

\[\begin{array}{rl}\frac{d}{dx}\left(x^{n}\right)&=\frac{d}{dx} \left(xx^{n-1}\right)\\ &=\frac{d}{dx}\left(x\right)\cdot\left(x^{n-1}\right)+x\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left(\overset{\cdot}{x}^{n-1}\right)\left(\text{by product rule}\right)\\ &=1\cdot x^{n-1}+x\cdot\left(\left(n-1\right)x^{n-2}\right)\left(\text{by induction hypothesis}\right)\\ &=\overset{\cdot}{x}^{n-1}+\left(n-1\right)x^{n-1}=nx^{n-1}.\end{array}\]

_Remark_ The above theorem is true for all powers of \(x\), i.e., \(n\) can be any real number (but we will not prove it here).

#### 12.5.2 Derivative of polynomials and trigonometric functions

We start with the following theorem which tells us the derivative of a polynomial function.

**Theorem 7**: Let \(f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+....+a_{1}x+a_{0}\) be a polynomial function, where \(a_{i}s\) are all real numbers and \(a_{n}\neq 0\). Then, the derivative function is given by

\[\begin{array}{rl}\frac{df(x)}{dx}=na_{n}x^{n-1}+\left(n-1\right)a_{n-1}x^{n- 2}+...+\overset{\cdot}{2}a_{2}x+a_{1}.\end{array}\]

Proof of this theorem is just putting together part (i) of Theorem 5 and Theorem 6.

**Example 13**: Compute the derivative of \(6x^{100}-x^{55}+x\).

**Solution** A direct application of the above theorem tells that the derivative of the above function is \(600x^{99}-55x^{54}+1\cdot\)

**Example 14**: Find the derivative of \(f(x)=1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+...+x^{50}\) at \(x=1\).

Solution A direct application of the above Theorem 6 tells that the derivative of the above function is \(1+2x+3x^{2}+\ldots+50x^{49}\). At \(x=1\) the value of this function equals

\[1+2(1)+3(1)^{2}+...+50(1)^{49}=1+2+3+...+50=\frac{\ddots\big{(}50\big{)}\big{(}5 1\big{)}}{2}=1275.\]

**Example 15**: Find the derivative of \(f(x)=\frac{x+1}{x}\)

Solution Clearly this function is defined everywhere except at \(x=0\). We use the quotient rule with \(u=x+1\) and \(v=x\). Hence \(u^{\prime}=1\) and \(v^{\prime}=1\). Therefore

\[\frac{\cdot}{dx}(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\Bigg{(}\frac{x+1}{x}\Bigg{)}=\frac{d}{dx} \Bigg{(}\frac{u}{v}\Bigg{)}=\frac{u^{\prime}v-uv^{\prime}}{v^{2}}=\frac{1 \big{(}x\big{)}-\big{(}x+1\big{)}1}{x^{2}}=\frac{1}{x^{2}}\]

**Example 16**: Compute the derivative of \(\sin x\).

Solution Let \(f(x)=\sin x\). Then

\[\frac{\cdot}{dx}(x) =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}=f\big{(}x\big{)}}{h} =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sin\big{(}x+h\big{)}-\sin\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2\cos\bigg{(}\frac{2x+h}{2}\bigg{)}\sin \bigg{(}\frac{h}{2}\bigg{)}}{h}\] (using formula for \[\sin\]  A \[-\sin\] B)

\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\cos\bigg{(}x+\frac{h}{2}\bigg{)}\cdot\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sin \frac{h}{2}}{\frac{h}{2}}=\cos x.1=\cos x\]

**Example 17**: Compute the derivative of \(\tan x\).

Solution Let \(f(x)=\tan x\). Then

\[\frac{df(x)}{dx} =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f\big{(}x+h\big{)}-f\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\tan\big{(}x+h\big{)}-\tan\big{(}x\big{)}}{h}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\Bigg{[}\frac{\sin\big{(}x+h\big{)}}{\cos \big{(}x+h\big{)}}-\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\Bigg{]}\]\[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\left[\frac{\sin\big{(}x+h\big{)}\cos x-\cos\big{(}x+h \big{)}\sin x}{h\cos\big{(}x+h\big{)}\cos x}\right]\] \[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sin\big{(}x+h-x\big{)}}{h\cos\big{(}x+h \big{)}\cos x}\ \ (\text{using formula for $\sin\ (\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B})$})\] \[\cdot\] \[=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sin h}{h}\cdot\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{\cos\big{(}x+h \big{)}\cos x}\] \[\cdot\] \[=1.\frac{1}{\cos^{2}x}=\sec^{2}x\.\]

**Example 18**: Compute the derivative of \(f(x)=\sin^{2}x\).

SolutionWe use the Leibnitz product rule to evaluate this.

\[\frac{df(x)}{dx} =\frac{d}{dx}\big{(}\sin x\sin x\big{)}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\big{(}\sin x\big{)}^{\prime}\sin x+\sin x\big{(}\sin x\big{)}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\big{(}\cos x\big{)}\sin x+\sin x\big{(}\cos x\big{)}\] \[\cdot\] \[=2\sin x\cos x=\sin 2x\.\]

Alternatively, this may be computed by noting that \(\cot x=\frac{1}{\tan x}\). Here, we use the fact that the derivative of \(tan\)\(x\) is \(sec^{2}x\) which we saw in Example 17 and also that the derivative of the constant function is 0.

\[\frac{\dot{dg}}{dx} =\frac{d}{dx}(\cot x)=\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(\frac{1}{\tan x}\right)\] \[=\frac{\dot{(1)^{\prime}}(\tan x)-(1)(\tan x)^{\prime}}{(\tan x) ^{2}}\] \[=\frac{\dot{(0)(\tan x)}-(\sec x)_{\odot}^{2}}{(\tan x)^{2}}\] \[=\frac{\dot{-\sec^{2}x}}{\tan^{2}x}=-\cos\!\!\sec^{2}x\]

**Example 22**: Find the derivative of

**Solution (i)**: Let \(h(x)=\frac{x^{5}-\cos x}{\sin x}\). We use the quotient rule on this function wherever it is defined.

\[h^{\prime}(x)=\frac{(x^{5}-\cos x)^{\prime}\sin x-(x^{5}-\cos x)(\sin x)^{ \prime}}{(\sin x)^{2}}\]\[=\ \frac{\cdot}{\left(5x^{4}+\sin x\right)\sin x-\left(x^{5}-\cos x \right)\cos x}{\sin^{2}x}\] \[=\ \frac{-x^{5}\cos x+5x^{4}\sin x+1}{\left(\sin x\right)^{2}}\]

(ii) We use quotient rule on the function \(\frac{\cdot}{x+\cos x}\) wherever it is defined.

\[\dot{h^{\prime}}(x) =\ \frac{\cdot\left(x+\cos x\right)^{\prime}\tan x-\left(x+\cos x \right)\left(\tan x\right)^{\prime}}{\left(\tan x\right)^{2}}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{\left(1-\sin x\right)\tan x-\left(x+\cos x\right)\sec^{2}x }{\left(\tan x\right)^{2}}\]

In the history of mathematics two names are prominent to share the credit for inventing calculus, Issac Newton (\(1642-1727\)) and G.W. Leibnitz (\(1646-1717\)). Both of them independently invented calculus around the seventeenth century. After the advent of calculus many mathematicians contributed for further development of calculus. The rigorous concept is mainly attributed to the great mathematicians, A.L. Cauchy, J.L.Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass. Cauchy gave the foundation of calculus as we have now generally accepted in our textbooks. Cauchy used D'Alembert's limit concept to define the derivative of a function. Starting with definition of a limit, Cauchy gave examples such as the limit of \(\cdot\)\(\dfrac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\) for \(\cdot\)\(\alpha=0\). He wrote \(\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)\(=\dfrac{f(x+i)-f(x)}{i}\), and called the limit for \(i\to 0\), the "function derive'e, \(y^{\prime}\) for \(f^{\prime}\left(x\right)\)".

Before 1900, it was thought that calculus is quite difficult to teach. So calculus became beyond the reach of youngsters. But just in 1900, John Perry and others in England started propagating the view that essential ideas and methods of calculus were simple and could be taught even in schools. F.L. Griffin, pioneered the teaching of calculus to first year students. This was regarded as one of the most daring act in those days.

Today not only the mathematics but many other subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Economics and Biological Sciences are enjoying the fruits of calculus.

We know that statistics deals with data collected for specific purposes. We can make decisions about the data by analysing and interpreting it. In earlier classes, we have studied methods of representing data graphically and in tabular form. This representation reveals certain salient features or characteristics of the data. We have also studied the methods of finding a representative value for the given data. This value is called the measure of central tendency. Recall mean (arithmetic mean), median and mode are three measures of central tendency. A _measure of central tendency_ gives us a rough idea where data points are centred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the data, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are bunched around a measure of central tendency.

Consider now the runs scored by two batsmen in their last ten matches as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l c} Batsman A : 30, 91, 0, 64, 42, 80, 30, 5, 117, 71 \\ Batsman B : 53, 46, 48, 50, 53, 53, 58, 60, 57, 52 \\ \end{tabular} Clearly, the mean and median of the data are

\begin{tabular}{l c} Batsman A & Batsman B \\ Mean & 53 & 53 \\ Median & 53 & 53 \\ \end{tabular} Recall that, we calculate the mean of a data (denoted by \(\vec{x}\) ) by dividing the sum of the observations by the number of observations, i.e.,\[\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\]

Also, the median is obtained by first arranging the data in ascending or descending order and applying the following rule.

If the number of observations is odd, then the median is \(\cdot\cdot\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)^{\text{th}}\) observation.

If the number of observations is even, then median is the mean of \(\cdot\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{\text{th}}\) and \(\cdot\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)^{\text{th}}\) observations.

We find that the mean and median of the runs scored by both the batsmen A and B are same i.e., 53. Can we say that the performance of two players is same? Clearly No, because the variability in the scores of batsman A is from 0 (minimum) to 117 (maximum). Whereas, the range of the runs scored by batsman B is from 46 to 60.

Let us now plot the above scores as dots on a number line. We find the following diagrams:

For batsman A

For batsman B

**Fig 13.2**

We can see that the dots corresponding to batsman B are close to each other and are clustering around the measure of central tendency (mean and median), while those corresponding to batsman A are scattered or more spread out.

Thus, the measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete information about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be studied under statistics. Like '_measures of central tendency_' we want to have a single number to describe variability. This single number is called a '_measure of dispersion_'. In this Chapter, we shall learn some of the important measures of dispersion and their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data.

### Measures of Dispersion

The dispersion or scatter in a data is measured on the basis of the observations and the types of the measure of central tendency, used there. There are following measures of dispersion:

(i) Range, (ii) Quartile deviation, (iii) Mean deviation, (iv) Standard deviation.

In this Chapter, we shall study all of these measures of dispersion except the quartile deviation.

### Range

Recall that, in the example of runs scored by two batsmen A and B, we had some idea of variability in the scores on the basis of minimum and maximum runs in each series. To obtain a single number for this, we find the difference of maximum and minimum values of each series. This difference is called the 'Range' of the data.

In case of batsman A, Range = 117 - 0 = 117 and for batsman B, Range = 60 - 46 = 14. Clearly, Range of A > Range of B. Therefore, the scores are scattered or dispersed in case of A while for B these are close to each other.

Thus, Range of a series = Maximum value - Minimum value.

The range of data gives us a rough idea of variability or scatter but does not tell about the dispersion of the data from a measure of central tendency. For this purpose, we need some other measure of variability. Clearly, such measure must depend upon the difference (or deviation) of the values from the central tendency.

The important measures of dispersion, which depend upon the deviations of the observations from a central tendency are mean deviation and standard deviation. Let us discuss them in detail.

### Mean Deviation

Recall that the deviation of an observation \(x\) from a fixed value _'a'_ is the difference \(x-a\). In order to find the dispersion of values of \(x\) from a central value _'a'_, we find the deviations about \(a\). An absolute measure of dispersion is the mean of these deviations. To find the mean, we must obtain the sum of the deviations. But, we know that a measure of central tendency lies between the maximum and the minimum values of the set of observations. Therefore, some of the deviations will be negative and some positive. Thus, the sum of deviations may vanish. Moreover, the sum of the deviations from mean (\(\overline{x}\) ) is zero.

Also Mean of deviations = \(\frac{\text{Sum of deviations}}{\text{Number of observations}}=\frac{0}{n}=0\)

Thus, finding the mean of deviations about mean is not of any use for us, as far as the measure of dispersion is concerned.

**(i) Mean deviation about mean**

First of all we find the mean \(\overline{x}\) of the given data by using the formula

\[\cdot\]

\[\overline{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}f_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}}\ =\ \frac{1}{N}\ \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}f_{i}\,\]

where \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}f_{i}\) denotes the sum of the products of observations \(x_{i}\) with their respective frequencies \(f_{i}\) and \(N=\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}\) is the sum of the frequencies.

Then, we find the deviations of observations \(x_{i}\) from the mean \(\overline{x}\) and take their absolute values, i.e., \(\left|x_{i}-\overline{x}\right|\) for all \(i=1\), \(2,\ldots\).

After this, find the mean of the absolute values of the deviations, which is the required mean deviation about the mean. Thus

\[\cdot\]

**(ii) Mean deviation about median**

To find mean deviation about median, we find the median of the given discrete frequency distribution. For this the observations are arranged in ascending order. After this the cumulative frequencies are obtained. Then, we identify the observation whose cumulative frequency is equal to or just greater than \(\frac{N}{2}\), where N is the sum of frequencies. This value of the observation lies in the middle of the data, therefore, it is the required median. After finding median, we obtain the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from median. Thus,

\[\cdot\]

assumed mean. This is nothing but the shifting of origin from zero to the assumed mean on the number line, as shown in Fig 13.3

If there is a common factor of all the deviations, we divide them by this common factor to further simplify the deviations. These are known as step-deviations. The process of taking step-deviations is the change of scale on the number line as shown in Fig 13.4

The deviations and step-deviations reduce the size of the observations, so that the computations viz. multiplication, etc., become simpler. Let, the new variable be denoted by \(\cdot\)

 by \(d_{i}=\dfrac{x_{i}-a}{h}\), where \(\hat{a}\) is the assumed mean and \(h\) is the common factor. Then, the mean \(\cdot\)

by step-deviation method is given by

\[\overline{x}=a+\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}\ d_{i}}{\text{N}}\times h\]

Let us take the data of Example 6 and find the mean deviation by using step-deviation method.

Take the assumed mean \(a=45\) and \(h=10\), and form the following Table 13.5.

where median class is the class interval whose cumulative frequency is just greater than or equal to \(\frac{\text{N}}{2}\), N is the sum of frequencies, \(l\),\(f\), \(h\) and C are, respectively the lower limit, the frequency, the width of the median class and C the cumulative frequency of the class just preceding the median class.

The process is illustrated in the following example:

**Example 7** Calculate the mean deviation about median for the following data :

**Solution** Form the following Table 13.6 from the given data :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Class & Frequency & Cumulative & Mid-points & \(\left|x_{i}-\text{Med}\right|\) & \(f_{i}\left|x_{i}-\text{Med}\right|\) \\ \hline

50-60 & 2 & 50 & 55 & 27 & 54 \\ \hline  & 50 & & & & 508 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The class interval containing \(\dfrac{\cdot}{2}\) or \(25^{\text{th}}\) item is 20-30. Therefore, 20-30 is the median class. We know that

\[\cdot\] Median \[=l+\dfrac{\dfrac{\mathrm{N}}{2}-\mathrm{C}}{f}\times h\]

Here \(l=20\), \(\mathrm{C}=13,f=15\), \(h=10\) and \(\mathrm{N}=50\)

Therefore, Median \[=20+\dfrac{25-13}{15}\times 10=20+8=28\]

#### Limitations of mean deviation

In a series, where the degree of variability is very high, the median is not a representative central tendency. Thus, the mean deviation about median calculated for such series can not be fully relied.

The sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum of the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very scientific. Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean deviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore, cannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some other measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion.

### Variance and Standard Deviation

Recall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values of the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the mean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves.

Another way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations, is to take squares of all the deviations. Obviously all these squares of deviations are 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:272]

\(\cdot\)

If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\big{(}x_{i}-\overline{x}\big{)}^{2}\) is simply our measure of dispersion or scatter about mean, we will tend to say that the set A of six observations has a lesser dispersion about the mean than the set B of 31 observations, even though the observations in set A are more scattered from the mean (the range of deviations being from -25 to 25) than in the set B (where the range of deviations is from -15 to 15).

This is also clear from the following diagrams.

For the set A, we have

\(\cdot\)

For the set B, we have

\(\cdot\)

Thus, we can say that the sum of squares of deviations from the mean is not a proper measure of dispersion. To overcome this difficulty we take the mean of the squares of the deviations, i.e., we take \(\cdot\).

Mean \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\times 1750=291.67\) and in case of the set B, it is \(\dfrac{1}{31}\times 2480=80\).

This indicates that the scatter or dispersion is more in set A than the scatter or dispersion in set B, which confirms with the geometrical representation of the two sets.

Thus, we can take \(\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\big{(}x_{i}-\overline{x}\big{)}^{2}\) as a quantity which leads to a proper measure of dispersion. This number, i.e., mean of the squares of the deviations from mean is called the _variance_ and is denoted by \(\cdot\)\(\sigma^{2}\) (read as sigma square). Therefore, the variance of \(n\) observations \(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\) is given by \[\sigma^{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\]

#### 13.5.1 Standard Deviation

In the calculation of variance, we find that the units of individual observations \(x_{i}\) and the unit of their mean \(\overline{x}\) are different from that of variance, since variance involves the sum of squares of \(\left(x_{i}^{-}\overline{x}\right)\). For this reason, the proper measure of dispersion about the mean of a set of observations is expressed as positive square-root of the variance and is called _standard deviation_. Therefore, the standard deviation, usually denoted by \(\sigma\), is given by

\[\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\]

Let us take the following example to illustrate the calculation of variance and hence, standard deviation of ungrouped data.

**Example 8**: Find the variance of the following data:

\[6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24\]

**Solution** From the given data we can form the following Table 13.7. The mean is calculated by step-deviation method taking 14 as assumed mean. The number of observations is \(n=10\)

### Miscellaneous Examples

**Example 13** The variance of 20 observations is 5. If each observation is multiplied by 2, find the new variance of the resulting observations.

* Let the observations be \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{20}\) and \(\overline{x}\) be their mean. Given that variance \(=5\) and \(n=20\). We know that.
* Variance \(\left(\sigma^{\cdot}\right)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{20}\left(x_{i}- \overline{x}\right)^{2}\), i.e., 5 = \(\frac{1}{20}\sum_{i=1}^{20}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\)

or \(\sum_{i=1}^{20}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}=100\)

If each observation is multiplied by 2, and the new resulting observations are \(y_{i}\), then... (1)

\[y_{i}=2x_{i}\text{ i.e., }x_{i}=\frac{1}{2}y_{i}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:283]

\[x^{2}+y^{2}\ -\ 2xy=97-72\ \ \ \text{i.e.}\ \ (x-y)^{2}=25\]

or

\[x-y=\pm 5\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\...\ (5)\]

So, from (1) and (5), we get

\[x=9,\,y=4\ \ \text{when}\ \ x-y=5\]

or

\[x=4,\,y=9\ \ \text{when}\ \ x-y=-\ 5\]

Thus, the remaining observations are 4 and 9.

**Example 15**: If each of the observation \(x_{{}_{1}}\), \(x_{{}_{2}}\),...,\(x_{{}_{n}}\) is increased by _'a'_, where \(a\) is a negative or positive number, show that the variance remains unchanged.

**Solution**: Let \(\overline{x}\) be the mean of \(x_{{}_{1}}\), \(x_{{}_{2}}\),...,\(x_{{}_{n}}\). Then the variance is given by

\[\cdot\overbrace{\sigma_{{}_{1}}^{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}- \overline{x})^{2}\]

If _'a_ is added to each observation, the new observations will be

\[y_{{}_{i}}=x_{{}_{i}}+a\]

Let the mean of the new observations be \(\overline{y}\). Then

\[\cdot\overline{y} =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{{}_{i}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x _{i}+a)\] \[=\frac{1}{n}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}a\right]= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}+\frac{na}{n}=\overline{x}+a\]

i.e.

\[\cdot\overline{y}=\overline{x}+a\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \...\ (2)\]

Thus, the variance of the new observations is same as that of the original observations.

**Example 16**: The mean and standard deviation of 100 observations were calculated as 40 and 5.1, respectively by a student who took by mistake 50 instead of 40 for one observation. What are the correct mean and standard deviation?

The theoretical development of statistics came during the mid seventeenth century and continued after that with the introduction of theory of games and chance (i.e., probability). Francis Galton (1822-1921), an Englishman, pioneered the use of statistical methods, in the field of Biometry. Karl Pearson (1857-1936) contributed a lot to the development of statistical studies with his discovery of _Chi square test_ and foundation of _statistical laboratory_ in England (1911). Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962), known as the Father of modern statistics, applied it to various diversified fields such as Genetics, Biometry, Education, Agriculture, etc.

### Event

We have studied about random experiment and sample space associated with an experiment. The sample space serves as an universal set for all questions concerned with the experiment.

Consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times: An associated sample space is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

Now suppose that we are interested in those outcomes which correspond to the occurrence of exactly one head. We find that HT and TH are the only elements of S corresponding to the occurrence of this happening (event). These two elements form the set \(\mathrm{E}=\{\) HT, TH\(\}\)

We know that the set \(\mathrm{E}\) is a subset of the sample space S. Similarly, we find the following correspondence between events and subsets of S.

Description of events

Corresponding subset of 'S'

Number of tails is exactly 2

A = {TT}

Number of tails is atleast one

B = {HT, TH, TT}

Number of heads is atmost one

C = {HT, TH, TT}

Second toss is not head

D = {HT, TT}

Number of tails is atmost two

S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}

Number of tails is more than two

\(\phi\)

The above discussion suggests that a subset of sample space is associated with an event and an event is associated with a subset of sample space. In the light of this we define an event as follows.

**Definition**: Any subset \(\mathrm{E}\) of a sample space S is called _an event_.

#### 14.1.1 Occurrence of an event

Consider the experiment of throwing a die. Let E denotes the event " a number less than 4 appears". If actually '1' had appeared on the die then we say that event E has occurred. As a matter of fact if outcomes are 2 or 3, we say that event E has occurred

Thus, the event E of a sample space S is said to have occurred if the outcome \(\omega\) of the experiment is such that \(\omega\in\) E. If the outcome \(\dot{\omega}\) is such that \(\omega\not\in\) E, we say that the event E has not occurred.

#### 14.1.2 Types of events

Events can be classified into various types on the basis of the elements they have.

#### 1.1.2 Impossible and Sure Events

The empty set \(\phi\) and the sample space S describe events. In fact \(\phi\) is called an _impossible event_ and S, i.e., the whole sample space is called the _sure event_.

To understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated sample space is

\[\text{S}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\]

Let E be the event " the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7". Can you write the subset associated with the event E?

Clearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of the sample space ensures the occurrence of the event. E. Thus, we say that the empty set only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to have a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E = \(\phi\) is an impossible event.

Now let us take up another event F "the number turns up is odd or even". Clearly F = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,} = S, i.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of the event F. Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.

#### 2.2. Simple Event

If an event E has only one sample point of a sample space, it is called a _simple_ (or _elementary_) _event_.

In a sample space containing \(n\) distinct elements, there are exactly \(n\) simple events.

For example in the experiment of tossing two coins, a sample space is

\[\text{S}=\{\text{HH},\,\text{HT},\,\text{TH},\,\text{TT}\}\]

There are four simple events corresponding to this sample space. These are

\[\text{E}_{\text{i}}=\{\text{HH}\},\,\text{E}_{\text{2}}=\{\text{HT}\},\, \text{E}_{\text{3}}=\{\text{ TH}\}\text{ and }\text{E}_{\text{4}}=\{\text{TT}\}.\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:291]

**3. The Event 'A and B'** We know that intersection of two sets \(A\cap B\) is the set of those elements which are common to both \(A\) and \(B\). i.e., which belong to both 'A and \(B\)'.

If \(A\) and \(B\) are two events, then the set \(A\cap B\) denotes the event 'A and \(B\)'.

Thus, \(A\cap B=\{\omega:\omega\in A\text{ and }\omega\in B\}\)

For example, in the experiment of 'throwing a die twice' Let \(A\) be the event'score on the first throw is six' and \(B\) is the event'sum of two scores is atleast 11' then

\(A=\{(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)\}\), and \(B=\{(5,6),(6,5),(6,6)\}\)

so \(A\cap B=\{(6,5),(6,6)\}\)

Note that the set \(A\cap B=\{(6,5),(6,6)\}\) may represent the event 'the score on the first throw is six and the sum of the scores is atleast 11'.

**4. The Event 'A but not B'** We know that \(A\)-\(B\) is the set of all those elements which are in \(A\) but not in \(B\). Therefore, the set \(A\)-\(B\) may denote the event'A but not B'.We know that

\(A-B=A\cap B\)'

**Example 1** Consider the experiment of rolling a die. Let \(A\) be the event 'getting a prime number', \(B\) be the event 'getting an odd number'. Write the sets representing the events (i) \(A\)or \(B\) (ii) \(A\) and \(B\) (iii) \(A\) but not \(B\) (iv) \(not\)\(A\)'.

**Solution** Here \(S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), \(A=\{2,3,5\}\) and \(B=\{1,3,5\}\)

Obviously

1. 'A or \(B\)' = \(A\cup B=\{1,2,3,5\}\)
2. 'A and \(B\)' = \(A\cap B=\{3,5\}\)
3. 'A but not \(B\)' = \(A-B=\{2\}\)
4. 'not \(A\)' = \(A\)' = \(\{1,4,6\}\)

**14.1.4**_Mutually exclusive events_ In the experiment of rolling a die, a sample space is \(S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\). Consider events, \(A\) 'an odd number appears' and \(B\) 'an even number appears'

Clearly the event \(A\) excludes the event \(B\) and vice versa. In other words, there is no outcome which ensures the occurrence of events \(A\) and \(B\) simultaneously. Here

\(A=\{1,3,5\}\) and \(B=\{2,4,6\}\)

Clearly \(A\cap B=\phi\), i.e., \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint sets.

In general, two events \(A\) and \(B\) are called _mutually exclusive_ events if the occurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other event, i.e., if they can not occur simultaneously. In this case the sets \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint.

Again in the experiment of rolling a die, consider the events A 'an odd number appears' and event B 'a number less than 4 appears'

Obviously A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3}

Now 3 \(\in\) A  as well as 3 \(\in\) B

Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive events.

Remark Simple events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.

**14.1.5**_Exhaustive events_ Consider the experiment of throwing a die. We have S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let us define the following events

A: 'a number less than 4 appears',

B: 'a number greater than 2 but less than 5 appears'

and C: 'a number greater than 4 appears'.

Then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3,4} and C = {5, 6}. We observe that

\[\text{A}\cup\text{B}\cup\text{C}=\{1,2,3\}\cup\{3,4\},\cup\{5,6\},\equiv\text{ S}.\]

Such events A, B and C are called exhaustive events. In general, if E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),..., E\({}_{n}\) are \(n\) events of a sample space S and if

\[\text{E}_{1}\cup\text{E}_{2}\cup\text{E}_{3}\cup\ldots\cup\text{E}_{n}=\overset {n}{\underset{i=1}{\cup}\text{E}_{i}}=\text{S}\]

then E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),...., E\({}_{n}\) are called exhaustive events. In other words, events E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),..., E\({}_{n}\) are said to be exhaustive if atleast one of them necessarily occurs whenever the experiment is performed.

Further, if E\({}_{i}\cap\text{E}_{j}=\phi\) for \(i\neq j\) i.e., events E\({}_{i}\) and E\({}_{j}\)are pairwise disjoint and \(\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\cup}\text{E}_{i}}=\text{S}\), then events E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),..., E\({}_{n}\) are called _mutually exclusive and exhaustive events_.

We now consider some examples.

Example Two dice are thrown and the sum of the numbers which come up on the dice is noted. Let us consider the following events associated with this experiment

A: 'the sum is even'.

B: 'the sum is a multiple of 3'.

C: 'the sum is less than 4'.

D: 'the sum is greater than 11'.

Which pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?

**Solution** There are 36 elements in the sample space \(\mathrm{S}=\{(x,y)\): \(x,y=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), \(6\}\). Then

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{A}=\{(1,1),(1,3),(1,5),(2,2),(2,4),(2,6),(3,1),(3,3),(3, 5),(4,2),(4,4),\\ \qquad(4,6),(5,1),(5,3),(5,5),(6,2),(6,4),(6,6)\}\\ \mathrm{B}=\{(1,2),(2,1),(1,5),(5,1),(3,3),(2,4),(4,2),(3,6),(6,3),(4,5),(5,4), \\ \qquad(6,6)\}\\ \mathrm{C}=\{(1,1),(2,1),(1,2)\}\text{ and }\mathrm{D}=\{(6,6)\}\end{array}\]

We find that

\[\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\{(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1),(6,6)\}\neq\phi\]

Therefore, \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are not mutually exclusive events.

Similarly \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{C}\neq\phi\), \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{D}\neq\phi\), \(\mathrm{B}\cap\mathrm{C}\neq\phi\) and \(\mathrm{B}\cap\mathrm{D}\neq\phi\).

Thus, the pairs of events, (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) are not mutually exclusive events.

Also \(\mathrm{C}\cap\mathrm{D}=\phi\) and so \(\mathrm{C}\) and \(\mathrm{D}\) are mutually exclusive events.

**Example 3** A coin is tossed three times, consider the following events.

A: 'No head appears', B: 'Exactly one head appears' and C: 'Atleast two heads appear'.

Do they form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events?

**Solution** The sample space of the experiment is

\[\mathrm{S}=\{\mathrm{HHH},\mathrm{HHT},\mathrm{HTH},\mathrm{THH},\mathrm{HTH}, \mathrm{THT},\mathrm{THT},\mathrm{TTT}\}\]

and \(\mathrm{A}=\{\mathrm{TTT}\}\), \(\mathrm{B}=\{\mathrm{HTT},\mathrm{THT},\mathrm{TTH}\}\), \(\mathrm{C}=\{\mathrm{HHT},\mathrm{HTH},\mathrm{THH},\mathrm{HHH}\}\)

Now

\[\mathrm{A}\cup\mathrm{B}\cup\mathrm{C}=\{\mathrm{TTT},\mathrm{HTT},\mathrm{ THT},\mathrm{THT},\mathrm{HHT},\mathrm{HTH},\mathrm{THH},\mathrm{THH}\}=\mathrm{S}\]

Therefore, \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) are exhaustive events.

Also, \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{B}=\phi\), \(\mathrm{A}\cap\mathrm{C}=\phi\) and \(\mathrm{B}\cap\mathrm{C}=\phi\)

Therefore, the events are pair-wise disjoint, i.e., they are mutually exclusive.

Hence, \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

**EXERCISE 14.1**

**1.** A die is rolled. Let \(\mathrm{E}\) be the event "die shows 4" and \(\mathrm{F}\) be the event "die shows even number". Are \(\mathrm{E}\) and \(\mathrm{F}\) mutually exclusive?

### Axiomatic Approach to Probability

In earlier sections, we have considered random experiments, sample space and events associated with these experiments. In our day to day life we use many words about the chances of occurrence of events. Probability theory attempts to quantify these chances of occurrence or non occurrence of events.

In earlier classes, we have studied some methods of assigning probability to an event associated with an experiment having known the number of total outcomes.

Axiomatic approach is another way of describing probability of an event. In this approach some axioms or rules are depicted to assign probabilities.

Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. The probability P is a real valued function whose domain is the power set of S and range is the interval [0,1] satisfying the following axioms

1. For any event \(E\), \(P\left(E\right)\geq 0\) (ii) \(P\left(S\right)=1\)
2. If \(E\) and \(F\) are mutually exclusive events, then \(P(E\cup F)=P(E)+P(F)\).

It follows from (iii) that \(P(\phi)=0\). To prove this, we take \(F=\phi\) and note that \(E\) and \(\phi\) are disjoint events. Therefore, from axiom (iii), we get

\(P\left(E\cup\phi\right)=P\left(E\right)+P\left(\phi\right)\) or \(P(E)=P(E)+P\left(\phi\right)\) i.e. \(P\left(\phi\right)=0\).

Let S be a sample space containing outcomes \(\omega_{1},\omega_{2},...,\omega_{n}\), i.e.,

\(S=\left\{\omega_{1},\omega_{2},...,\omega_{n}\right\}\).

It follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that

1. \(0\leq P\left(\omega_{i}\right)\leq 1\) for each \(\omega_{i}\in S\)
2. \(P\left(\omega_{1}\right)+P\left(\omega_{2}\right)+...+P\left(\omega_{n}\right)=1\)
3. For any event \(A\), \(P(A)=\sum P(\omega_{i})\), \(\omega_{i}\in A\).

Note. It may be noted that the singleton \(\left\{\omega_{i}\right\}\) is called elementary event and for notational convenience, we write \(P(\omega_{i})\) for \(P(\left\{\omega_{i}\right\})\).

For example, in a coin tossing' experiment we can assign the number \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) to each of the outcomes \(H\) and \(T\).

i.e.

\(P(H)=\dfrac{1}{2}\) and \(P(T)=\dfrac{1}{2}\)

Clearly this assignment satisfies both the conditions i.e., each number is neither less than zero nor greater than 1 and

\(P(H)+P(T)=\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{2}=1\)

Therefore, in this case we can say that probability of \(H=\dfrac{1}{2}\), and probability of \(T=\dfrac{1}{2}\)

\(\dfrac{1}{4}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:297]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:298]

\[=\text{P}(\text{HH})+\text{P}(\text{TT})=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{9}{28}=\frac{4}{7}\]

For the event F: 'exactly two heads', we have F = {HH}

and

\[\text{P}(\text{F})=\text{P}(\text{HH})=\frac{\cdot 1}{4}\]

#### 14.2.2 Probabilities of equally likely outcomes

Let a sample space of an experiment be

\[\text{S}=\{\omega_{1},\omega_{2},\ldots,\omega_{n}\}.\]

Let all the outcomes are equally likely to occur, i.e., the chance of occurrence of each simple event must be same.

\[\text{P}(\omega_{i})=p,\text{ for all }\omega_{i}\in\text{S where }0\leq p\leq 1\]

Since

\[\overset{\cdot}{\underset{i=1}{\cdot}}\text{P}(\omega_{i})=I\text{ i.e., }p+p+...+p\text{ ($n$ times)}=1\]

or

\[np=1\text{ i.e., }p=\frac{1}{n}\]

Let S be a sample space and E be an event, such that \(n\)(S) = \(n\) and \(n\)(E) = \(m\). If each out come is equally likely, then it follows that

\[\text{P}(\text{E})=\frac{m}{n}\text{ Number of outcomes favourable to E}\]

#### 14.2.3 Probability of the event '4 or B'

Let us now find the probability of event 'A or B', i.e., P (A \(\cup\) B)

Let A = {HHT, HTH, THH} and B = {HTH, THH, HHH} be two events associated with 'tossing of a coin-thrice'.

Clearly A \(\cup\) B = {HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}

Now

\[\text{P}(\text{A}\cup\text{B})=\text{P}(\text{HHT})+\text{P}(\text{HTH})+ \text{P}(\text{THH})+\text{P}(\text{HHH})\]

If all the outcomes are equally likely, then

\[\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup\text{B}\right)=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}= \frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}\]

Also

\[\text{P}(\text{A})=\text{P}(\text{HHT})+\text{P}(\text{HTH})+\text{P}(\text{ THH})=\frac{\cdot 3}{8}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:300]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:301]

\[\begin{split}&\cdot\\ &=\frac{6}{10}=\frac{3}{5}\\ &\cdot\cdot\\ \text{Thus,}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{P(A')}&=\frac{3}{5}=1-\frac{2}{5}=1- \text{P(A)}\end{split}\]

Also, we know that A' and A are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events i.e.,

\[\begin{split}&\text{A'}\cap\text{A'}=\phi\text{ and }\text{A'}\cup\text{A'}=\text{S}\\ \text{or}&\text{P(A'}\cup\text{A'})=\text{P(S)}\\ \text{Now}&\text{P(A)}+\text{P(A'})=1,\\ \text{or}&\text{P(A'}\,)=\text{P(not A)}=1-\text{P(A)} \end{split}\]

We now consider some examples and exercises having equally likely outcomes unless stated otherwise.

**Example 5** One card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards. If each outcome is equally likely, calculate the probability that the card will be

1. a diamond
2. a black card (i.e., a club or, a spade)
3. not a diamond
4. not a black card.

**Solution** When a card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards, the number of possible outcomes is 52.

1. Let A be the event 'the card drawn is a diamond' Clearly the number of elements in set A is 13.

Therefore, \[\text{P(A)}=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}\]

i.e. probability of a diamond card = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

2. We assume that the event 'Card drawn is an ace' is B Therefore 'Card drawn is not an ace' should be B'.

We know that P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1-\(\frac{4}{52}=1-\frac{1}{13}=\frac{12}{13}\)

3. Let C denote the event 'card drawn is black card' Therefore, number of elements in the set C = 26 i.e. P(C) = \(\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}\)Thus, probability of a black card = \(\frac{1}{2}\).

(iv)We assumed in (i) above that A is the event 'card drawn is a diamond', so the event 'card drawn is not a diamond' may be denoted as A' or 'not A'

\(\cdot\)

Now P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \(\frac{1}{4}\) = \(\frac{3}{4}\)

(v)The event 'card drawn is not a black card' may be denoted as C' or 'not C'.

We know that P(not C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \(\frac{1}{2}\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, probability of not a black card = \(\frac{1}{2}\)

**Example 6** A bag contains 9 discs of which 4 are red, 3 are blue and 2 are yellow. The discs are similar in shape and size. A disc is drawn at random from the bag. Calculate the probability that it will be (i) red, (ii) yellow, (iii) blue, (iv) not blue, (v) either red or blue.

**Solution** There are 9 discs in all so the total number of possible outcomes is 9.

Let the events A, B, C be defined as

A: 'the disc drawn is red'

B: 'the disc drawn is yellow'

C: 'the disc drawn is blue'

(i)The number of red discs = 4, i.e., \(n\) (A) = 4

Hence P(A) = 9

(ii)The number of yellow discs = 2, i.e., \(n\) (B) = 2

Therefore, P(B) = \(\frac{2}{9}\)

(iii)The number of blue discs = 3, i.e., \(n\)(C) = 3

Therefore, P(C) = \(\frac{3}{9}\) = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

(iv)Clearly the event 'not blue' is 'not C'. We know that P(not C) = 1 - P(C)Therefore P(not C) = 1-\(\frac{1}{3}\) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

(v) The event 'either red or blue' may be described by the set 'A or C'

Since, A and C are mutually exclusive events, we have

\[\mbox{P(A or C)}=\mbox{ P (A $\cup$ C)}=\mbox{P(A)}+\mbox{P(C)}=\frac{\cdot \frac{4}{9}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{7}{9}\]

**Example 7** Two students Anil and Ashima appeared in an examination. The probability that Anil will qualify the examination is 0.05 and that Ashima will qualify the examination is 0.10. The probability that both will qualify the examination is 0.02. Find the probability that

(a) Both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination.

(b) Atleast one of them will not qualify the examination and

(c) Only one of them will qualify the examination.

Solution Let E and F denote the events that Anil and Ashima will qualify the examination, respectively. Given that

\[\mbox{P(E)}=0.05,\mbox{ P(F)}=0.10\mbox{ and P(E $\cap$ F)}=0.02.\]

Then

(a) The event 'both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination' may be expressed as \(\mbox{ E }\cap\mbox{ F }\).

Since, \(\mbox{ E }^{\prime}\) is 'not E', i.e., Anil will not qualify the examination and F' is 'not F', i.e., Ashima will not qualify the examination.

Also \(\mbox{ E }^{\prime}\cap\mbox{ F }^{\prime}=\mbox{(E $\cup$ F)}^{\prime}\) (by Demorgan's Law)

Now P(E \(\cup\) F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E \(\cap\) F)

or P(E \(\cup\) F) = 0.05 + 0.10 - 0.02 = 0.13

Therefore P(E', C', F')= P(E \(\cup\) F)' = 1 - P(E \(\cup\) F) = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87

(b) P (atleast one of them will not qualify)

\(=1-\mbox{P(both of them will qualify)}\)

\(=1-\mbox{0.02}=0.98\)

(c) The event only one of them will qualify the examination is same as the event either (Anil will qualify, and Ashima will not qualify) or (Anil will not qualify and Ashimawill qualify) i.e., \(E\cap F^{{}^{\prime}}\) or \(E^{{}^{\prime}}\cap F\), where \(E\cap F^{{}^{\prime}}\) and \(E^{{}^{\prime}}\cap F\) are mutually exclusive.

Therefore, \(P(\text{only one of them will qualify})\)\(=P(E\cap F^{{}^{\prime}}\text{ or }E^{{}^{\prime}}\cap F)\)

\(=P(E\cap F^{{}^{\prime}})+P(E^{{}^{\prime}}\cap F)=P\ (E)-P(E\cap F)+P(F)-P\ (E\cap F)\)

\(=0.05-0.02+0.10-0.02=0.11\)

**Example 8** A committee of two persons is selected from two men and two women. What is the probability that the committee will have (a) no man? (b) one man? (c) two men?

**Solution** The total number of persons \(=2+2=4\). Out of these four person, two can be selected in \({}^{4}C_{2}\) ways.

(a) No men in the committee of two means there will be two women in the committee.

Out of two women, two can be selected in \({}^{2}C_{2}=1\) way.

Therefore \(P\big{(}\text{no man}\big{)}=\frac{{}^{2}C_{2}}{{}^{4}C_{2}}=\frac{1\times 2 \times 1}{4\times 3}=\frac{1}{6}\)

(b) One man in the committee means that there is one woman. One man out of 2 can be selected in \({}^{2}C_{1}\) ways and one woman out of 2 can be selected in \({}^{2}C_{1}\) ways.

Together they can be selected in \({}^{2}C_{1}\times{}^{2}C_{1}\) ways.

Therefore \(P\big{(}\text{One man}\big{)}=\frac{{}^{2}C_{1}\times{}^{2}C_{f}}{{}^{4}C_{2}}= \frac{2\times 2}{2\times 3}=\frac{2}{3}\)

(c) Two men can be selected in \({}^{2}C_{2}\) way.

Hence \(P\big{(}\text{Two men}\big{)}=\frac{{}^{2}C_{2}}{{}^{4}C_{2}}=\frac{1}{{}^{4}C_{ 2}}=\frac{1}{6}\)

##### Miscellaneous Examples

**Example 9** On her vacations Veena visits four cities (A, B, C and D) in a random order. What is the probability that she visits

1. A before B? (ii) A before B and B before C?
2. A first and B last? (iv) A either first or second?
3. A just before B?

SolutionThe number of arrangements (orders) in which Veena can visit four cities A, B, C, or D is 4! i.e., 24.Therefore, \(n\) (S) = 24.

Since the number of elements in the sample space of the experiment is 24 all of these outcomes are considered to be equally likely. A sample space for the experiment is

\(\mathrm{S}\ =\{\)ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, ACDB, ADBC, ADCB

ABCD, BADC, BDAC, BDCA, BCAD, BCDA

CABD, CADB, CBDA, CBAD, CDAB, CDBA

DABC, DACB, DBCA, DBAC, DCAB, DCBA\(\}\)

(i) Let the event'she visits A before B' be denoted by E

Therefore, \(\mathrm{E}=\{\)ABCD, CABD, DABC, ABDC, CADB, DACB\(\}\)

Thus

\(\mathrm{P}\big{(}\mathrm{E}\big{)}=\frac{n\big{(}\mathrm{E}\big{)}}{n\big{(} \mathrm{S}\big{)}}=\frac{12}{24}=\frac{1}{2}\)

(ii) Let the event 'Veena visits A before B and B before C' be denoted by F.

Here \(\mathrm{F}=\{\)ABCD, DABC, ABDC, ADBC\(\}\)

Therefore, \(\mathrm{P}\big{(}\mathrm{F}\big{)}=\frac{n\big{(}\mathrm{F}\big{)}}{n\big{(} \mathrm{S}\big{)}}=\frac{4}{24}=\frac{1}{6}\)

Students are advised to find the probability in case of (iii), (iv) and (v).

\[=\overset{\cdot}{P}\left(A\cap B\right)+P\left(A\cap C\right)-\overset{\cdot}{P}\left[A \wedge B\cap C\right]\quad\quad... \tag{3}\]

Using (2) and (3) in (1), we get

\[\overset{\cdot}{\cdot}P\left(A\cap B\right)-P\left(A\cap C\right)+P\left(A\cap B \right)+P\left(C\right)-P\left(A\cap B\cap C\right)\]

**Example 12**: In a relay race there are five teams A, B, C, D and E.

1. What is the probability that A, B and C finish first, second and third, respectively.
2. What is the probability that A, B and C are first three to finish (in any order) (Assume that all finishing orders are equally likely)

**Solution**: If we consider the sample space consisting of all finishing orders in the first three places, we will have \(\overset{\cdot}{5}P_{3}\), i.e., \(\dfrac{5!}{\left(5-3\right)!}=5\times 4\times 3=60\) sample points, each with a probability of \(\dfrac{1}{60}\).

1. A, B and C finish first, second and third, respectively. There is only one finishing order for this, i.e., ABC.

Thus P(A, B and C finish first, second and third respectively) \(=\dfrac{1}{60}\).
2. A, B and C are the first three finishers. There will be 3! arrangements for A, B and C. Therefore, the sample points corresponding to this event will be 3! in number.

So P (A, B and C are first three to finish) \(=\dfrac{3!}{60}=\dfrac{6}{60}=\dfrac{1}{10}\)

## Summary

In this Chapter, we studied about the axiomatic approach of probability. The main features of this Chapter are as follows:

* _Event_: A subset of the sample space
* _Impossible event_ : The empty set
* _Sure event_: The whole sample space

* _Event_**A _or_** B: The set A \(\cup\) B
* _Event_**A _and_** B: The set A \(\cap\) B

* _Mutually exclusive event_: A and B are mutually exclusive if A \(\cap\)B = \(\phi\)
* _Exhaustive and mutually exclusive events_: Events \(\mathrm{E}_{1}\), \(\mathrm{E}_{2}\), \(\mathrm{E}_{n}\) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive if \(\mathrm{E}_{1}\)\(\cup\)\(\mathrm{E}_{2}\), \(\mathrm{\cup}\)\(\mathrm{E}_{n}\) = S and \(\mathrm{E}_{1}\)\(\cap\)\(\mathrm{E}_{j}\) = \(\phi\)\(\forall\)\(i\neq j\)
* _Probability_: Number P (\(\omega_{i}\)) associated with sample point \(\omega_{i}\) such that (i) \(0\leq\) P (\(\omega_{i}\)) \(\leq\) 1 (ii) \(\sum\)P(\(\omega_{i}\)) for all \(\omega_{i}\)\(\in\) S = 1 (iii) \(\mathrm{P(A)}\) = \(\sum\)P(\(\omega_{i}\)) for all \(\omega_{i}\)\(\in\) A. The number P (\(\omega_{i}\)) is called _probability of the outcome \(\omega_{i}\)_
* _Equally likely outcomes_: All outcomes with equal probability
* _Probability of an event_: For a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes \(\cdot\) Probability of an event P(A)=\(\dfrac{n(\mathrm{A})}{n(\mathrm{S})}\), where \(n(\mathrm{A})\) = number of elements in the set A, \(n(\mathrm{S})\) = number of elements in the set S.
* P(A and B) equivalently, P(A \(\cup\) B) = P(A) + P(B)
- P(A \(\cap\) B)
* If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

### Historical Note

Probability theory like many other branches of mathematics, evolved out of practical consideration. It had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian physician and mathematician Jerome Cardan (1501-1576) wrote the first book on the subject "Book on Games of Chance" (Biber de Ludo Aleae). It was published in 1663 after his death.

In 1654, a gambler Chevalier de Metre approached the well known French Philosopher and Mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) for certain dice problem. Pascal became interested in these problems and discussed with famous French Mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Both Pascal and Fermat solved the problem independently. Besides, Pascal and Fermat, outstanding contributions to probability theory were also made by Christian Huygenes (1629-1665), a Dutchman, J. Bernoulli (1654-1705), De Moivre (1667-1754), a Frenchman Pierre Laplace (1749-1827), the Russian P.L. Chebyshev (1821-1897), A. A Markov (1856-1922) and A. N Kolmogorov' (1903-1987). Kolmogorov is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book 'Foundations of Probability' published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is considered a classic.

It may be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a beautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising one when we read it. -- G.

### 1.1 Introduction

Recall that the notion of relations and functions, domain, co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI along with different types of specific real valued functions and their graphs. The concept of the term'relation' in mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation in English language, according to which two objects or quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection or link between the two objects or quantities. Let, \(A\) be the set of students of Class XII of a school and \(B\) be the set of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some of the examples of relations from \(A\) to \(B\) are

* \(\{(a,\,b)\,\in\,A\times B\colon a\text{ is brother of }b\}\),
* \(\{(a,\,b)\,\in\,A\times B\colon a\text{ is sister of }b\}\),
* \(\{(a,\,b)\,\in\,A\times B\colon a\text{ is greater than age of }b\}\),
* \(\{(a,\,b)\,\in\,A\times B\colon total\text{ marks obtained by }a\text{ in the final examination is less than the total marks obtained by }b\text{ in the final examination}\}\),
* \(\{(a,\,b)\,\in\,A\times B\colon a\text{ lives in the same locality as }b\}\). However, abstracting from this, we define mathematically a relation \(R\) from \(A\) to \(B\) as an arbitrary subset of \(A\times B\).

If \((a,\,b)\in R\), we say that \(a\) is related to \(b\) under the relation \(R\) and we write as \(a\)\(R\)\(b\). In general, \((a,\,b)\in R\), we do not bother whether there is a recognisable connection or link between \(a\) and \(b\). As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of relations.

In this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations.

**Definition 4** A relation R in a set A is said to be an _equivalence relation_ if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

**Example 2** Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by R = {(T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\)) : T\({}_{1}\) is congruent to T\({}_{2}\)}. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

**Solution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further, (T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\)) \(\in\) R \(\Rightarrow\) T\({}_{1}\) is congruent to T\({}_{2}\) \(\Rightarrow\) T\({}_{2}\) is congruent to T\({}_{1}\) \(\Rightarrow\) (T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{1}\)) \(\in\) R. Hence, R is symmetric. Moreover, (T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\)), (T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{3}\)) \(\in\) R \(\Rightarrow\) T\({}_{1}\) is congruent to T\({}_{2}\) and T\({}_{2}\) is congruent to T\({}_{3}\) \(\Rightarrow\) T\({}_{1}\) is congruent to T\({}_{3}\) \(\Rightarrow\) (T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{3}\)) \(\in\) R. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation.

**Example 3** Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as R = {(L\({}_{1}\), L\({}_{2}\)) : L\({}_{1}\) is perpendicular to L\({}_{2}\)}. Show that R is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive.

**Solution R is not reflexive, as a line L\({}_{1}\) can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L\({}_{1}\), L\({}_{1}\)) \(\not\in\) R. R is symmetric as (L\({}_{1}\), L\({}_{2}\)) \(\in\) R

\(\Rightarrow\) L\({}_{1}\) is perpendicular to L\({}_{2}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) L\({}_{2}\) is perpendicular to L\({}_{1}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) (L\({}_{2}\), L\({}_{1}\)) \(\in\) R.

R is not transitive. Indeed, if L\({}_{1}\) is perpendicular to L\({}_{2}\) and L\({}_{2}\) is perpendicular to L\({}_{3}\), then L\({}_{1}\) can never be

### Types of Functions

The notion of a function along with some special functions like identity function, constant function, polynomial function, rational function, modulus function, signum function etc. along with their graphs have been given in Class XI.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two functions have also been studied. As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and among other disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from where we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of functions.

Consider the functions \(f_{1},f_{2},f_{3}\) and \(f_{4}\) given by the following diagrams.

In Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X\({}_{1}\) under the function \(f_{1}\) are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X\({}_{1}\) under \(f_{2}\) is same, namely \(b\). Further, there are some elements like \(e\) and \(f\) in X\({}_{2}\) which are not images of any element of X\({}_{1}\) under\(f_{1}\), while all elements of X\({}_{3}\) are images of some elements of X\({}_{1}\) under\(f_{3}\). The above observations lead to the following definitions:

**Definition 5** A function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) Y is defined to be _one-one_ (or _injective_), if the images of distinct elements of X under \(f\) are distinct, i.e., for every \(x_{{}_{1}},\,x_{{}_{2}}\in\) X, \(f(x_{{}_{1}})=f(x_{{}_{2}})\) implies \(x_{{}_{1}}=x_{{}_{2}}\). Otherwise, \(f\) is called _many-one_.

The function \(f_{j}\) and \(f_{4}\) in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function \(f_{{}_{2}}\) and \(f_{3}\) in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.

**Definition 6** A function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) Y is said to be _onto_ (or _surjective_), if every element of Y is the image of some element of X under \(f\), i.e., for every \(y\in\) Y, there exists an element \(x\) in X such that \(f(x)=y\).

The function \(f_{3}\) and \(f_{4}\) in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function \(f_{1}\) in Fig 1.2 (i) is not onto as elements \(e,f\) in X\({}_{2}\) are not the image of any element in X\({}_{1}\) under \(f_{1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:321]

**Example 9**: Prove that the function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\), given by \(f(x)=2x\), is one-one and onto.

**Solution**: \(f\) is one-one, as \(f(x_{{}_{1}})=f(x_{{}_{2}})\Rightarrow 2x_{{}_{1}}=2x_{{}_{2}}\Rightarrow x_{{}_{1}}=x_{{}_{2}}\). Also, given any real number \(y\) in \(\mathbf{R}\), there exists \(\frac{y}{2}\) in \(\mathbf{R}\) such that \(f(\frac{y}{2})=2\). \((\frac{y}{2})=y\). Hence, \(f\) is onto.

**Example 10**: Show that the function \(f\colon\mathbf{N}\to\mathbf{N}\), given by \(f(1)=f(2)=1\) and \(f(x)=x-1\), for every \(x>2\), is onto but not one-one.

**Solution**: \(f\) is not one-one, as \(f(1)=f(2)=1\). But \(f\)'s onto, as given any \(y\in\mathbf{N},y\neq 1\), we can choose \(x\) as \(y\in\mathbf{1}\) such that \(f(0)+1)=y+1-1=y\). Also for \(1\in\mathbf{N}\), we have \(f(1)=1\).

**Example 11**: Show that the function \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\), defined as \(f(x)=x^{2}\), is neither one-one nor onto.

**Solution**: Since \(f(-1)=1\), \(f\) is not one-one. Also, the element \(-2\) in the co-domain \(\mathbf{R}\) is not image of any element \(x\) in the domain \(\mathbf{R}\) (Why?). Therefore \(f\) is not onto.

**Example 12**: Show that \(f\colon\mathbf{N}\to\mathbf{N}\), given by

\[f(x)=\begin{array}{l}x+1,\text{if $x$ is odd,}\\ x-1,\text{if $x$ is even}\end{array}\]

is both one-one and onto.

**Solution**: Suppose \(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\). Note that if \(x_{1}\) is odd and \(x_{2}\) is even, then we will have \(x_{1}+1=x_{2}-1\), i.e., \(x_{2}-x_{1}=2\) which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of \(x_{1}\) being even and \(x_{2}\) being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore, both \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) must be either odd or even. Suppose both \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are odd. Then \(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\Rightarrow x_{1}+1=x_{2}+1\Rightarrow x_{1}=x_{2}\). Similarly, if both \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are even, then also \(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\Rightarrow x_{1}-1=x_{2}-1\Rightarrow x_{1}=x_{2}\). Thus, \(f\) is one-one. Also, any odd number \(2r+1\) in the co-domain \(\mathbf{N}\) is the image of \(2r+2\) in the domain \(\mathbf{N}\) and any even number \(2r\) in the co-domain \(\mathbf{N}\) is the image of \(2r-1\) in the domain \(\mathbf{N}\). Thus, \(f\) is onto.

**Example 13**: Show that an onto function \(f\): \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\rightarrow\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) is always one-one.

**Solution**: Suppose \(f\)is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say \(1\) and \(2\) in the domain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of \(3\) under \(f\) can be only one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the co-domain \(\{1,2,3\}\), showing that \(f\) is not onto, a contradiction. Hence, \(f\) must be one-one.

**Example 14**: Show that a one-one function \(f\): \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\rightarrow\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) must be onto.

**Solution**: Since \(f\)is one-one, three elements of \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\), must be taken to \(3\) different elements of the co-domain \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) under \(f\). Hence, \(f\) has to be onto.

_Remark_: The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary finite set \(\mathrm{X}\), i.e., a one-one function \(f\): \(\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathrm{X}\) is necessarily onto and an onto map \(f\): \(\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathrm{X}\) is necessarily one-one, for every finite set \(\mathrm{X}\). In contrast to this, Examples 8 and 10 show that for an infinite set, this may not be true. In fact, this is a characteristic difference between a finite and an infinite set.

**EXFRCISE 1.2**:

1. Show that the function \(f\): \(\mathbf{R}_{\bullet}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}_{\bullet}\) defined by \(f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}\) is one-one and onto, where \(\mathbf{R}_{\bullet}\) is the set of all non-zero real numbers. Is the result true, if the domain \(\mathbf{R}_{\bullet}\) is replaced by \(\mathbf{N}\) with co-domain being same as \(\mathbf{R}_{\bullet}\)?
2. Check the injectivity and surjectivity of the following functions: 1. \(f\): \(\mathbf{N}\rightarrow\mathbf{N}\) given by \(f(x)=x^{2}\) 2. 2.

Show that the Modulus Function\(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\), given by \(f(x)=|\,x\,|\), is neither one-one nor onto, where \(|\,x\,|\) is \(x\), if \(x\) is positive or \(0\) and \(|\,x\,|\) is \(-x\), if \(x\) is negative.
5. Show that the Signum Function\(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\), given by \[f(x)=\begin{cases}1,\text{if }\,x>0\\ 0,\text{if }\,x=0\\ 1,\text{if }\,x<0\end{cases}\] is neither one-one nor onto.
6. Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 6, 7} and let\(f\)= {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)} be a function from A to B. Show that \(f\) is one-one.
7. In each of the following cases, state whether the function is one-one, onto or bijective. Justify your answer. (i) \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) defined by \(f(x)=3-4x\) (ii) \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) defined by \(f(x)=1+x^{2}\) 8. Let A and B be sets. Show that \(f\colon\mathbf{A}\times\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{B}\times\mathbf{A}\) such that \(f(a,\,b)=(b,\,a)\) is bijective function.
9. Let \(f\colon\mathbf{N}\to\mathbf{N}\) be defined by \(f(n)=\begin{cases}n+1\\ 2\end{cases}\), if \(n\) is odd \(\begin{cases}n+1\\ 2\end{cases}\) for all \(n\in\mathbf{N}\).

State whether the function \(f\) is bijective. Justify your answer.
10. Let A = \(\mathbf{R}-\{3\}\) and B = \(\mathbf{R}-\{1\}\). Consider the function \(f\colon\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{B}\) defined by \(f(x)=\begin{pmatrix}x-2\\ x-3\end{pmatrix}\). Is \(f\) one-one and onto? Justify your answer.
11. Let \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) be defined as \(f(x)=x^{4}\). Choose the correct answer. (A) \(f\) is one-one onto (B) \(f\) is many-one onto (C) \(f\) is one-one but not onto (D) \(f\) is neither one-one nor onto.
12. Let \(f\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}\) be defined as \(f(x)=3x\). Choose the correct answer. (A) \(f\) is one-one onto (B) \(f\) is many-one onto (C) \(f\) is one-one but not onto (D) \(f\) is neither one-one nor onto.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:325]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:326]

\(\subset\{1,\,4,\,7\}\) or \(\{x,\,y\}\subset\{2,\,5,\,8\}\) or \(\{x,\,y\}\subset\{3,\,6,\,9\}\Rightarrow x-y\) is divisible by \(3\Rightarrow\{x,\,y\}\in\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\). This shows that \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{2}}\subset\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\). Hence, \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}=\mathrm{R}_{{}_{2}}\).

**Example 21**: Let \(f\colon\mathrm{X}\rightarrow\mathrm{Y}\) be a function. Define a relation \(\mathrm{R}\) in \(\mathrm{X}\) given by \(\mathrm{R}=\{(a,\,b)\colon f(a)=f(b)\}\). Examine whether \(\mathrm{R}\) is an equivalence relation or not.

Solution For every \(a\in\mathrm{X}\), \((a,\,a)\in\mathrm{R}\), since \(f(a)=f(a)\), showing that \(\mathrm{R}\) is reflexive. Similarly, \((a,\,b)\in\mathrm{R}\Rightarrow f(a)=f(b)\Rightarrow f(b)=f(a)\Rightarrow(b,\,a)\in \mathrm{R}\). Therefore, \(\mathrm{R}\) is symmetric. Further, \((a,\,b)\in\mathrm{R}\) and \((b,\,c)\in\mathrm{R}\Rightarrow f(a)=f(b)\) and \(f(b)=f(c)\Rightarrow f(a)\)\(=f(c)\Rightarrow(a,\,c)\in\mathrm{R}\), which implies that \(\mathrm{R}\) is transitive. Hence, \(\mathrm{R}\) is an equivalence relation.

**Example 22**: Find the number of all one-one functions from set \(\mathrm{A}=\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) to itself.

Solution One-one function from \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) to itself is simply a permutation on three symbols \(1,\,2,\,3\). Therefore, total number of one-one maps from \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) to itself is same as total number of permutations on three symbols \(1,\,2,\,3\) which is \(3!=6\).

**Example 23**: Let \(\mathrm{A}=\{1,\,2,\,3\}\). Then show that the number of relations containing \((1,\,2)\) and \((2,\,3)\) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three.

Solution The smallest relation \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) containing \((1,\,2)\) and \((2,\,3)\) which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is \(\{(1,\,1\},\,(2,2),(3,\,3),(1,\,2),(2,\,3),(1,\,3)\}\). Now, if we add the pair \((2,\,1)\) to \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) to get \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{2}}\), then the relation \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{2}}\)will be reflexive, transitive but not symmetric. Similarly, we can obtain \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{3}}\) by adding \((3,\,2)\) to \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) to get the desired relation. However, we can not add two pairs \((2,\,1)\), \((\$,\,\,2)\) or single pair \((3,\,1)\) to \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) at a time, as by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity and in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus, the total number of desired relations is three.

**Example 24**: Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set \(\{1,\,2,\,3\}\) containing \((1,\,2)\) and \((2,\,1)\) is two.

Solution The smallest equivalence relation \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) containing \((1,\,2)\) and \((2,\,1)\) is \(\{(1,\,1)\), \((2,\,2)\), \((3,\,3)\), \((1,\,2)\), \((2,\,1)\}\). Now we are left with only \(4\) pairs namely \((2,\,3)\), \((3,\,2)\), \((1,\,3)\) and \((3,\,1)\). If we add any one, say \((2,\,3)\) to \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\), then for symmetry we must add \((3,\,2)\) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add \((1,\,3)\) and \((3,\,1)\). Thus, the only equivalence relation bigger than \(\mathrm{R}_{{}_{1}}\) is the universal relation. This shows that the total number of equivalence relations containing \((1,\,2)\) and \((2,\,1)\) is two.

**Example 25**: Consider the identity function \(\mathrm{I}_{{}_{N}}:\mathrm{N}\rightarrow\mathrm{N}\) defined as \(\mathrm{I}_{{}_{N}}\left(x\right)=x\,\

**Solution** Clearly \(I_{N}\) is onto. But \(I_{N}+I_{N}\) is not onto, as we can find an element \(3\) in the co-domain \(N\) such that there does not exist any \(x\) in the domain \(N\) with \((I_{N}+I_{N})\)\((x)=2x=3\).

**Example 26**: Consider a function \(f:\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) given by \(f(x)=\sin\,x\) and \(g:\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) given by \(g(x)=\cos\,x\). Show that \(f\) and \(g\) are one-one, but \(f+g\) is not one-one.

**Solution** Since for any two distinct elements \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) in \(\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\), \(\sin\,x_{1}\neq\sin\,x_{2}\) and \(\cos\,x_{1}\neq\cos\,x_{2}\), both \(f\) and \(g\) must be one-one. But \((f+g)\)\((0)=\sin\,0+\cos\,0=1\) and \((f+g)\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=\sin\frac{\pi}{2}+\cos\frac{\pi}{2}=1\). Therefore, \(f+g\) is not one-one.

_Miscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 1_

1. Show that the function \(f:\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\left\{x\in\mathbf{R}:-1<x<1\right\}\) defined by \(f(x)=\frac{x}{1+\left|\,x\right|}\), \(x\in\mathbf{R}\) is one one and onto function.

Are \(f\) and \(g\) equal? Justify your answer. (Hint: One may note that two functions \(f:A\rightarrow\mathrm{B}\) and \(g:A\rightarrow\mathrm{B}\) such that \(f(a)=g(a)\,\,\forall\,a\in A\), are called equal functions).

### Summary

In this chapter, we studied different types of relations and equivalence relation, composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. The main features of this chapter are as follows:

* _Empty relation_ is the relation R in X given by R = \(\phi\subset\) X \(\times\) X.
* _Universal relation_ is the relation R in X given by R = X \(\times\) X.
* _Reflexive relation_ R in X is a relation with \((a,\,a)\in\) R \(\forall\,\,a\in\) X.
* _Symmetric relation_ R in X is a relation satisfying \((a,\,b)\in\) R implies \((b,\,a)\in\) R.
* _Transitive relation_ R in X is a relation satisfying \((a,\,b)\in\) R and \((b,\,c)\in\) R implies that \((a,\,c)\in\) R.
* _Equivalence relation_ R in X is a relation which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
* _Equivalence class_\([a]\) containing \(a\in\) X for an equivalence relation R in X is the subset of X containing all elements \(b\) related to \(a\).
* A function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) Y is _one-one_ (or _injective_) if \(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\Rightarrow x_{1}=x_{2}\)\(\forall\,\,\,x_{1},x_{2}\in\) X.
* A function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) Y is _onto_ (or _surjective_) if given any \(y\in\) Y, \(\exists\,\,x\in\) X such that \(f(x)=y\).
* A function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) Y is _one-one and onto_ (or _bijective_), if \(f\) is both one-one and onto.
* Given a finite set X, a function \(f\colon\) X \(\to\) X is one-one (respectively onto) if and only if \(f\) is onto (respectively one-one). This is the characteristic property of a finite set. This is not true for infinite set 

### Historical Note

The concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from R. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word 'function' in his manuscript "_Geometrie_" in 1637 to mean some positive integral power \(x^{n}\) of a variable \(x\) while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James Gregory (1636-1675) in his work "_Yera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura_" (1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W. Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript "_Methodus tangentium inversa, seu, de functionibus_" written in 1673 used the word 'function' to mean a quantity varying from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However, in his manuscript "_Historia_" (1714), Leibnitz used the word 'function' to mean quantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase 'function of \(x\)'. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation \(\partial x\) for the first time in 1718 to indicate a function of \(x\). But the general adoption of symbols' like \(f\); F, \(\phi\), \(\psi\)... to represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first part of his manuscript "_Analysis Infinitorium_". Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) published his manuscripts "_Theorie des funetions analytiques_" in 1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion \(f(x)\), F(\(x\)), \(\phi(x)\) etc. for different function of \(x\). Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet (1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet in a rigorous manner.

## 2 Inverse Trigonometric Functions

### 2.1 Introduction

In Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function \(f\), denoted by \(f^{-1}\), exists if \(f\) is one-one and onto. There are many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and hence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their inverses do not exist. In this chapter, we shall study about the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and observe their behaviour through graphical representations. Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.

The inverse trigonometric functions play an important role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals. The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.

### 2.2 Basic Concepts

In Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{sine function, i.e., sine : }\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\left[-1,1\right]\\ \mbox{cosine function, i.e., cos : }\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\left[-1,1\right]\\ \mbox{tangent function, i.e., tan : }\mathbf{R}-\left\{\ x:x=(2n+1)\ \frac{\pi}{2}\,,\,n\in \mathbf{Z}\right\}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\\ \mbox{cotangent function, i.e., cot : }\mathbf{R}-\left\{\ x:x=n\pi,\ n\in\mathbf{Z}\right\} \rightarrow\mathbf{R}\\ \mbox{secant function, i.e., sec : }\mathbf{R}-\left\{\ x:x=(2n+1)\ \frac{\pi}{2}\,,\,n\in \mathbf{Z}\right\}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}-(-1,1)\\ \mbox{cosecant function, i.e., cosec : }\mathbf{R}-\left\{\ x:x=n\pi,\ n\in\mathbf{Z}\right\} \rightarrow\mathbf{R}-(-1,1)\end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:332]

of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function \(y=\sin^{-1}x\) can be obtained from the graph of \(y=\sin x\) by interchanging \(x\) and \(y\) axes. The graphs of \(y=\sin x\) and \(y=\sin^{-1}x\) are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii). The dark portion of the graph of \(y=\sin^{-1}x\) represent the principal value branch.
2. It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along the line \(y=x\). This can be visualised by looking the graphs of \(y=\sin x\) and \(y=\sin^{-1}x\) as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii)).

Like sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of all real numbers and range is the set [-1, 1]. If we restrict the domain of cosine function to \([0,\pi]\), then it becomes one-one and onto with range [-1, 1]. Actually, cosine function restricted to any of the intervals \([-\,\pi,\,0],\,\,[0,\pi],\,[\pi,\,2\pi]\) etc., is bijective with range as \([-1,\,1].\) We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by \(\cos^{-1}\) (arc cosine function). Thus, \(\cos^{-1}\) is a function whose domain is \([-1,\,1]\) and range could be any of the intervals \([-\pi,\,0],\,[0,\,\pi],\,[\pi,\,2\pi]\) etc. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function \(\cos^{-1}\). The branch with range \([0,\pi]\) is called the _principal value branch_ of the function \(\cos^{-1}\). We write

\[\cos^{-1}:[-1,\,1]\rightarrow[0,\,\pi].\]

The graph of the function given by \(y=\cos^{-1}x\) can be drawn in the same way as discussed about the graph of \(y=\sin^{-1}x\). The graphs of \(y=\cos x\) and \(y=\cos^{-1}x\) are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (ii).

Let us now discuss \(\cos^{-1}x\) and \(\sec^{-1}x\) as follows:

Since, \(\cos x=\dfrac{1}{\sin x}\), the domain of the cosec function is the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq n\pi\), \(n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and the range is the set \(\{y:y\in\mathbf{R}\), \(y\geq 1\) or \(y\leq-1\}\) i.e., the set \(\mathbf{R}-(-1,\,1)\). It means that \(y=\cos\,x\) assumes all real values except \(-1<y<1\) and is not defined for integral multiple of \(\pi\). If we restrict the domain of cosec function to \(\left[-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]=\{0\}\), then it is one to one and onto with its range as the set \(\mathbf{R}-(-1,1)\). Actually, cosec function restricted to any of the intervals \(\left[\dfrac{-3\pi}{2},\dfrac{-\pi}{2}\right]-\{-\pi\}\), \(\left[\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]-\{0\}\), \(\left[\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\right]-\{\pi\}\) etc., is bijective and its range is the set of all real numbers \(\mathbf{R}-(-1,\,1)\).

Thus \(\text{cosec}^{-1}\) can be defined as a function whose domain is \(\mathbf{R}-(-1,1)\) and range could be any of the intervals \(\left[\dfrac{-3\pi}{2},\dfrac{-\pi}{2}\right]-\{-\pi\},\)\(\left[\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]-\{0\},\)\(\left[\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\right]-\{\pi\}\) etc. The function corresponding to the range \(\left[\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]-\{0\}\) is called the _principal value branch_ of \(\text{cosec}^{-1}.\) We thus have principal branch as

\[\text{cosec}^{-1}\ \ \textbf{:}\ \textbf{R}-(-1,\ 1)\rightarrow\left[\dfrac{-\pi}{2 },\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]-\{0\}\]

The graphs of \(y=\text{cosec}\ x\) and \(y=\text{cosec}^{-1}\ x\) are given in Fig 2.3 (i), (ii).

\(\text{cosec}\ x=\dfrac{1}{\cos x}\,\) the domain of \(y=\text{sec}\ x\) is the set \(\mathbf{R}-\{x:x=(2n+1)\ \dfrac{\pi}{2}\,\)\(n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and range is the set \(\mathbf{R}-(-1,\ 1).\) It means that sec (secant function) assumes all real values except \(-1<y<1\) and is not defined for odd multiples of \(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\.\) If we restrict the domain of secant function to \([0,\pi]-\{\ \dfrac{\pi}{2}\ \},\) then it is one-one and onto with its range as the set \(\mathbf{R}-(\!-1,\,1).\) Actually, secant function restricted to any of the intervals \([\!-\pi,\,0]-\{\frac{-\pi}{2}\},\,[0,\pi]-\left\{\frac{\pi}{2}\right\},\,[\pi,\,2 \pi]-\dot{\{\frac{3\pi}{2}\}}\) etc., is bijective and its range is \(\mathbf{R}-\{-1,\,1\}.\) Thus sec\({}^{\!-1}\) can be defined as a function whose domain is \(\mathbf{R}-(\!-1,\,1)\) and range could be any of the intervals \([\!-\pi,\,0]-\dot{\{\frac{-\pi}{2}\}},[0,\pi]-\dot{\{\frac{\pi}{2}\}},[\pi,\,2 \pi]-\dot{\{\frac{3\pi}{2}\}}\) etc. Corresponding to each of these intervals, we get different branches of the function sec\({}^{\!-1}.\) The branch with range \([0,\,\pi]-\dot{\{\frac{\pi}{2}\}}\) is called the _principal value branch_ of the function sec\({}^{\!-1}.\) We thus have

\[\sec^{\!-1}:\mathbf{R}-(\!-1,\!1)\rightarrow[0,\,\pi]-\dot{\{\frac{\pi}{2}\}}\]

The graphs of the functions \(y=\sec x\) and \(y=\sec^{\!-1}x\) are given in Fig 2.4 (i), (ii).

Finally, we now discuss tan\({}^{\!-1}\) and cot\({}^{\!-1}\)

We know that the domain of the tan function (tangent function) is the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq(2n+1)\dot{\frac{\pi}{2}},\,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and the range is \(\mathbf{R}.\) It means that tan function is not defined for odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). If we restrict the domain of tangent function to \(\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\), then it is one-one and onto with its range as \(\mathbf{R}\). Actually, tangent function restricted to any of the intervals \(\left(\dfrac{-3\pi}{2},\dfrac{-\pi}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\right)\) etc., is bijective and its range is \(\mathbf{R}\). Thus \(\tan^{-1}\) can be defined as a function whose domain is \(\mathbf{R}\) and range could be any of the intervals \(\left(\dfrac{-3\pi}{2},\dfrac{-\pi}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{3\pi}{2}\right)\) and so on. These intervals give different branches of the function \(\tan^{-1}\). The branch with range \(\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\) is called the _principal value branch_ of the function \(\tan^{-1}\).

We thus have

\(\tan^{-1}:\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\)

The graphs of the function \(y=\tan x\) and \(y=\tan^{-1}\!x\) are given in Fig 2.5 (i), (ii).

We know that domain of the cot function (cotangent function) is the set \(\{x:x\in\mathbf{R}\) and \(x\neq n\pi\), \(n\in\mathbf{Z}\}\) and range is \(\mathbf{R}\). It means that cotangent function is not defined for integral multiples of \(\pi\). If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to \((0,\pi)\), then it is bijective with and its range as \(\mathbf{R}\). In fact, cotangent function restricted to any of the intervals \((-\pi,0)\), \((0,\pi)\), \((\pi,2\pi)\) etc., is bijective and its range is \(\mathbf{R}\). Thus \(\cot^{-1}\) can be defined as a function whose domain is the \(\mathbf{R}\) and range as any of the 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:338]

1. \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\!x\) should not be confused with \((\sin x)^{\text{-1}}\). In fact \((\sin x)^{\text{-1}}=\dfrac{1}{\sin x}\) and similarly for other trigonometric functions.
2. Whenever no branch of an inverse trigonometric functions is mentioned, we mean the principal value branch of that function.
3. The value of an inverse trigonometric functions which lies in the range of principal branch is called the _principal value_ of that inverse trigonometric functions.

We now consider some examples:

**Example 1**: Find the principal value of \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\).
**Solution**: Let \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\)= \(y\). Then, \(\sin y=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

We know that the range of the principal value branch of \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\) is \(\left(\dfrac{-\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)\) and \(\sin\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\)= \(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). Therefore, principal value of \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\) is \(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\)

**Example 2**: Find the principal value of \(\cot^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\)
**Solution**: Let \(\cot^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\)= \(y\). Then,

\(\cot y=\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}=-\cot\left(\dfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\)= \(\cot\left(\pi-\dfrac{\pi}{3}\right)\)= \(\cot\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{3}\right)\)

We know that the range of principal value branch of \(\cot^{\text{-1}}\) is \((0,\,\pi)\) and \(\cot\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{3}\right)\)= \(\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\). Hence, principal value of \(\cot^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\) is \(\dfrac{2\pi}{3}\)

Find the principal values of the following:

1. \(\sin^{\text{-1}}\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\) 2. \(\cos^{\text{-1}}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) 3. \(\cos^{\text{-1}}\left(2\right)\) 4. \(\tan^{\text{-1}}\left(-\sqrt{3}\right)\) 5. \(\cos^{\text{-1}}\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\) 6. \(\tan^{\text{-1}}\left(-1\right)\)7. \(\sec^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\) **8. \(\cot^{-1}\left(\sqrt{3}\right)\) **9. \(\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\)**

10. \(\cos\sec^{-1}\left(-\sqrt{2}\right)\)

Find the values of the following:

11. \(\tan^{-1}(1)+\cos^{-1}\) \(-\frac{1}{2}\) \(+\sin^{-1}\) \(-\frac{1}{2}\) **12. \(\cos^{-1}\) \(\frac{1}{2}\) \(+\ 2\)** sin^{-1}\(\frac{1}{2}\)**

13. **If \(\sin^{-1}x=y\), then.**

14. \(0\leq y\leq\pi\) **(B) \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq y\leq\frac{\pi}{2}\) **(C) \(0<\ y<\pi\) **(D) \(-\frac{\pi}{2}<y<\frac{\pi}{2}\)**

14. \(\tan^{-1}\sqrt{3}-\sec^{-1}\left(-2\right)\) **is equal to.**

14. \(\pi\) **(B) \(-\frac{\pi}{3}\) **(C) \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) **(D) \(2\pi\)**

### Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

In this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse trigonometric functions. In fact, they will be valid only for some values of \(x\) for which inverse trigonometric functions are defined. We will not go into the details of these values of \(x\) in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook.

Let us recall that if \(y=\sin^{-1}x\), then \(x=\sin y\) and if \(x=\sin y\), then \(y=\sin^{-1}x\). This is equivalent to

\[\sin\left(\sin^{-1}x\right)=x,\,x\in\ [-1,\,1]\mbox{ and }\sin^{-1}\left(\sin x\right)=x,\,x\in\left[\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\]

For suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric functions.

### Historical Note

The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.

In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of the main contribution of the _siddhantas_ (Sanskrit astronomical works) to mathematics.

Bhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than \(90^{\circ}\). A sixteenth century Malayalam work _Yuktibhasa_ contains a proof for the expansion of \(\sin\left(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}\right)\). Exact expression for sines or cosines of \(18^{\circ}\), \(36^{\circ}\), \(54^{\circ},72^{\circ}\), etc., were given by Bhaskara II.

The symbols \(\sin^{\!-1}x\), \(\cos^{\!-1}x\), etc., for arc \(\sin x\), arc \(\cos x\), etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios:

\[\frac{\mathbf{H}}{\mathbf{S}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{h}}{s}=\tan\left(\text{sun's altitude}\right)\]

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.

### Introduction

The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial management.

In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.

### Matrix

Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens. We may express it as [15 - 6] with the understanding that first number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possessionof notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Radha & has & 15 & notebooks & and & 6 pens, \\ Fauzia & has & 10 & notebooks & and & 2 pens, \\ Simran & has & 13 & notebooks & and & 5 pens. \\ \end{tabular}

Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & **Notebooks** & **Pens** \\ Radha & 15 & 6 \\ Fauzia & 10 & 2 \\ Simran & 13 & 5 \\ \end{tabular}

and this can be expressed as

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & 15 & 6 \\ 10 & 2 \\ 13 & 5 \\ \end{tabular}

or

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & **Radha** & **Fauzia** & **Simran** \\ Notebooks & 15 & 10 & 13 \\ Pens & 6 & 2 & 5 \\ which can be expressed as:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & 15 & 10 & 13 \\ 6 & 2 & 5 \\ First & Second & Third \\ Column & Column & Column \\ \end{tabular}

In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran,respectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a _matrix_. Formally, we define matrix as:

**Definition 1**: A _matrix_ is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.

We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}-2&5\\ 0&\sqrt{5}\\ 3&6\end{bmatrix},\text{ B}=\begin{bmatrix}2+i&3&-\dfrac{1}{2}\\ 3.5&-1&2\\ \sqrt{3}&5&\dfrac{5}{7}\end{bmatrix},\text{ C}=\begin{bmatrix}1+x&x^{3}&3\\ \cos x&\sin x+2&\tan x\end{bmatrix}\]

In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, _rows_ of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, _columns_ of the matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2 rows and 3 columns.

#### 3.2.1 Order of a matrix

A matrix having \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns is called a matrix of _order_\(m\times n\) or simply \(m\times n\) matrix (read as an \(m\) by \(n\) matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we have A as \(3\times 2\) matrix, B as \(3\times 3\) matrix and C as \(2\times 3\) matrix. We observe that A has \(3\times 2=6\) elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively.

In general, an \(m\times n\) matrix has the following rectangular array:

\[\text{or}\quad\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{ij}\end{bmatrix}_{m\times n},\text{ 1}\leq i\leq m,\text{ 1}\leq j\leq n\quad i,j\in\text{ N}\]

Thus the \(i^{\text{th}}\) row consists of the elements \(a_{i^{\text{1}}}\), \(a_{i^{\text{2}}}\), \(a_{i^{\text{3}}}\),..., \(a_{in}\), while the \(j^{\text{th}}\) column consists of the elements \(a_{i^{\text{1}}}\), \(a_{i^{\text{2}}}\), \(a_{i^{\text{3}}}\),..., \(a_{in}\),

In general \(a_{ij}\), is an element lying in the \(i^{\text{th}}\) row and \(j^{\text{th}}\) column. We can also call it as the \((i,j)^{\text{th}}\) element of A. The number of elements in an \(m\times n\) matrix will be equal to \(mn\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:350]

**Solution** The information is represented in the form of a \(3\times 2\) matrix as follows:

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}30&25\\ 25&31\\ 27&26\end{bmatrix}\]

The entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women workers in factory III.

**Example 2** If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

**Solution** We know that if a matrix is of order \(m\times n\), it has \(mn\) elements. Thus, to find all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural numbers, whose product is 8.

Thus, all possible ordered pairs are \((1,8)\), \((8,1)\), \((4,2)\), \((2,4)\)

Hence, possible orders are \(1\times 8\), \(8\times 1\), \(4\times 2\), \(2\times 4\)

**Example 3** Construct a \(3\times 2\) matrix whose elements are given by \(a_{ij}=\dfrac{1}{2}\left|i-3j\right|.\)

**Solution** In general a \(3\times 2\) matrix is given by \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}\end{bmatrix}.\)

Now

\[\begin{split}& a_{ij}=\dfrac{1}{2}\left|i-3j\right|,\;i=1,2,3 \text{ and }j=1,\;2.\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ \end{split}\]

Therefore

\[\begin{split}& a_{11}=\dfrac{1}{2}\left|1-3\times 1\right|=1 \qquad\;a_{12}=\dfrac{1}{2}\left|1-3\times 2\right|=\dfrac{5}{2}\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ &\cdot\\ \end{split}\]

Hence the required matrix is given by \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&\dfrac{5}{2}\\ \dfrac{1}{2}&2\\ 0&\dfrac{3}{2}\end{bmatrix}.\)

### Types of Matrices

In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices.

1. **Column matrix** A matrix is said to be a _column matrix_ if it has only one column.. For example, \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}0\\ \sqrt{3}\\ -1\\ 1/2\end{bmatrix}\) is a column matrix of order \(4\times 1\). In general, \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}a_{j}\\ \end{bmatrix}_{m\times 1}\) is a column matrix of order \(m\times 1\).
2. **Row matrix** A matrix is said to be a _row matrix_ if it has only one row. For example, \(\mathbf{B=}\begin{bmatrix}-\dfrac{1}{2}&\sqrt{5}&2&3\\ \end{bmatrix}_{1\times 4}\) is a row matrix. In general, \(\mathbf{B=}\begin{bmatrix}b_{j}\\ \end{bmatrix}_{1\times n}\) is a row matrix of order \(1\times n\).
3. **Square matrix** A matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is said to be a _square matrix_. Thus an \(\bar{m}\times n\) matrix is said to be a square matrix if \(m=n\) and is known as a square matrix of order '\(n\)'. For example \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&0\\ \dfrac{3}{2}&3&2\\ \end{bmatrix}\) is a square matrix of order \(3\). In general, \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}a_{j}\\ \end{bmatrix}_{m\times m}\) is a square matrix of order \(m\).

Note If \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}a_{j}\\ \end{bmatrix}\) is a square matrix of order \(n\), then elements \(a_{11}\), \(a_{22}\),..., \(a_{m}\) are said to constitute the _diagonal_, of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). Thus, if \(\mathbf{A=}\begin{bmatrix}1&-3&1\\ 2&4&-1\\ 3&5&6\end{bmatrix}\). Then the elements of the diagonal of \(\mathbf{A}\) are \(1\), \(4\), \(6\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:353]

* **Zero matrix** A matrix is said to be _zero matrix_ or _null matrix_ if all its elements are zero. For example, \([0]\), \(\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}\), \(\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\ 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\), \([0,\,0]\) are all zero matrices. We denote zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context.

#### 3.3.1 Equality of matrices

**Definition 2**: Two matrices \(\mathrm{A}=[a_{ij}]\) and \(\mathrm{B}=[b_{ij}]\) are said to be equal if

* they are of the same order
* each element of \(\mathrm{A}\) is equal to the corresponding element of \(\mathrm{B}\), that is \(a_{ij}=b_{ij}\) for all \(i\) and \(j\).

For example, \(\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\)and\(\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\) are equal matrices but \(\begin{bmatrix}3&2\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\) are not equal matrices. Symbolically, if two matrices \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) are equal, we write \(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{B}\).

If \(\begin{bmatrix}x&y\\ z&a\\ b&c\end{bmatrix}\)=\(\begin{bmatrix}-1.5&0\\ 2&\sqrt{6}\\ 3&2\end{bmatrix}\), then \(x=-1.5,y=0,z=2\), \(a=\sqrt{6}\), \(b=3\), \(c=2\)

**Example 4**: If \(\begin{bmatrix}x+3&z+4&2y-7\\ -6&a-1&0\\ b-3&-21&0\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}0&6&3y-2\\ -6&-3&2c+2\\ 2b+4&-21&0\end{bmatrix}\)

Find the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x_{y}\),\(y\) and \(z\).

SolutionAs the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get

\(x+3=0\), \(z+4=6\), \(2y-7=3y-2\)

\(a-1=-3\), \(0=2c+2\)\(b-3=2b+4\),

Simplifying, we get

\(a=-2\), \(b=-7\), \(c=-1\), \(x=-3\), \(y=-5\), \(z=2\)

**Example 5**: Find the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the following equation:

\[\begin{bmatrix}2a+b&a-2b\\ 5c-d&4c+3d\end{bmatrix}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:355]

8. A \(=[a_{y}]_{m\times n}\) is a square matrix, if (A) \(m<n\) (B) \(m>n\) (C) \(m=n\) (D) None of these
9. Which of the given values of \(x\) and \(y\) make the following pair of matrices equal \(\begin{bmatrix}3x+7&5\\ y+1&2-3x\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0&y-2\\ 8&4\end{bmatrix}\) (A) \(x=\dfrac{-1}{3}\), \(y=7\) (B) Not possible to find. (C) \(y=7\), \(x=\dfrac{-2}{3}\) (D) \(x=\dfrac{-1}{3}\), \(y=\dfrac{-2}{3}\)
10. The number of all possible matrices of order \(3\times 3\) with each entry \(0\) or \(1\) is: (A) \(27\) (B) \(18\) (C) \(81\) (D) \(512\)

### Operations on Matrices

In this section, we shall introduce certain operations on matrices, namely, addition of matrices, multiplication of a matrix by a scalar, difference and multiplication of matrices.

#### 3.4.1 Addition of matrices

Suppose Fatima has two factories at places A and B, Each factory produces sport shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below:

Suppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price category. Then the total production

In category \(1\) : for boys (\(80+90\)), for girls (\(60+50\))

In category \(2\) : for boys (\(75+70\)), for girls (\(65+55\))

In category \(3\) : for boys (\(90+75\)), for girls (\(85+75\))

This can be represented in the matrix form as \(\begin{bmatrix}80+90&60+50\\ 75+70&65+55\\ 90+75&85+75\end{bmatrix}\).

This new matrix is the **sum** of the above two matrices. We observe that the sum of two matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given matrices. Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{Thus, if \ \ A=}\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\end{bmatrix}\text{is a }2\times 3\text{ matrix and }\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}b_{11}&b_{12}&b_{13}\\ b_{21}&b_{22}&b_{23}\end{bmatrix}\text{is another}\\ \\ \cdot\\ 2\times 3\text{ matrix. Then, we define \ \ A+B=}\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}+b_{11}&a_{12}+b_{12}&a_{13}+b_{13}\\ a_{21}+b_{21}&a_{22}+b_{22}&a_{23}+b_{23}\end{bmatrix}.\end{array}\]

In general, if \(A=[a_{{}_{\beta}}]\) and \(B=[b_{{}_{\beta}}]\) are two matrices of the same order, say \(m\times n\). Then, the sum of the two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) is _defined_ as a matrix \(C=[c_{{}_{\beta}}]_{m\times n}\), where \(c_{{}_{\beta}}=a_{{}_{\beta}}+b_{{}_{\beta}}\), for all possible values of \(i\) and \(j\).

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{Example \ref{fig:A} Given \ \ A=}\begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{3}&1&-1\\ 2&3&0\end{bmatrix}\text{and }\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}2&\sqrt{5}&1\\ -2&3&1\end{bmatrix}\text{, find A}+B\\ \\ \cdotPreviously quantities (in standard units) produced by factory A were

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&\text{Boys}&\text{Girls}\\ &1&80&60\\ &75&65\\ &90&85\end{array}\]

Revised quantities produced by factory A are as given below:

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&\text{Boys}&\text{Girls}\\ &1&2\times 80&2\times 60\\ &2&2\times 75&2\times 65\\ &3&2\times 90&2\times 85\end{array}\]

This can be represented in the matrix form as the new matrix is obtained by multiplying each element of the previous matrix by 2.

In general, we may define _multiplication of a matrix_ by a scalar as follows: if \(\text{A}=[a_{{}_{\#}}]_{{}_{\text{m}\times n}}\) is a matrix and \(k\) is a scalar, then \(k\)A is another matrix which is obtained by multiplying each element of A by the scalar \(k\).

In other words, \(k\text{A}=k[a_{{}_{\#}}]_{{}_{\text{m}\times n}}=[\hat{k}(a_{{}_{\#}})]_{{}_{ \text{m}\times n}}\), that is, \((i,j)^{\text{th}}\) element of \(k\)A is \(ka_{{}_{\#}}\) for all possible values of \(i\) and \(j\).

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&\text{For example, if}&\text{A}=\begin{array}{ccc}3&1&1.5 \\ &\sqrt{5}&7&-3\\ &2&0&5\end{array}\end{array},\]

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&\text{For example, if}&\text{A}=\begin{array}{ccc}3&1&1.5 \\ &\sqrt{5}&7&-3\\ &2&0&5\end{array}\end{array}=\begin{bmatrix}9&3&4.5\\ &3\sqrt{5}&21&-9\\ &6&0&15\end{array}\]

**Negative of a matrix** The negative of a matrix is denoted by \(-\)A. We define \(-\)A = (\(-\)1) A.

For example, let

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\ -5&x\end{bmatrix},\text{ then }-\text{A}\text{ is given by}\]

\[\text{-A}=(-1)\text{A}=(-1)\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\ -5&x\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-3&-1\\ 5&-x\end{bmatrix}\]

**Difference of matrices** If \(\text{A}=[a_{{}_{j}}]\), \(\text{B}=[b_{{}_{j}}]\) are two matrices of the same order, say \(m\times n\), then difference \(\text{A}-\text{B}\) is defined as a matrix \(\text{D}=[d_{{}_{j}}]\), where \(d_{{}_{j}}=a_{{}_{j}}-b_{{}_{j}}\), for all value of \(i\) and \(j\). In other words, \(\text{D}=\text{A}-\text{B}=\text{A}+(-1)\text{B}\), that is sum of the matrix \(\text{A}\) and the matrix \(-\text{B}\).

**Example 7** If \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\ 2&3&1\end{bmatrix}\)and \(\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&3\\ -1&0&2\end{bmatrix}\), then find \(2\text{A}-\text{B}\).

**Solution** We have

\[2\text{A}-\text{B} = 2\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\ 2&3&1\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&3\\ -1&0&2\end{bmatrix}\] \[= \begin{bmatrix}2&4&6\\ 4&6&2\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}3&1&-3\\ 1&0&2\end{bmatrix}\]

#### 3.4.3 Properties of matrix addition

The addition of matrices satisfy the following properties:

1. **Commutative Law** If \(\text{A}=[a_{{}_{j}}]\), \(\text{B}=[b_{{}_{j}}]\) are matrices of the same order, say \(m\times n\), then \(\text{A}+\text{B}=\text{B}+\text{A}\). Now
2. **Associative Law** For any three matrices \(\text{A}=[a_{{}_{j}}]\), \(\text{B}=[b_{{}_{j}}]\), \(\text{C}=[c_{{}_{j}}]\) of the same order, say \(m\times n\), \((\text{A}+\text{B})+\text{C}=\text{A}+(\text{B}+\text{C})\). Now
3. \[(\text{A}+\text{B})+\text{C} =([a_{{}_{j}}]+[b_{{}_{j}}])+[c_{{}_{j}}]\] \[=[a_{{}_{j}}+b_{{}_{j}}]+[c_{{}_{j}}]=[(a_{{}_{

**Example 11**: Two farmers Ramkishan and Gurcharan Singh cultivates only three varieties of rice namely Basmati, Permal and Naura. The sale (in Rupees) of these varieties of rice by both the farmers in the month of September and October are given by the following matrices A and B.

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{September Sales (in Rupees)}&\\ \text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}&\\ \text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}5000&10,000&6000&\text{Ramkishan}\\ 20,000&10,000&10,000&\text{Gurcharan Singh}\end{array}\end{array}\]

1. Find the combined sales in September and October for each farmer in each variety.
2. Find the decrease in sales from September to October.
3. If both farmers receive 2% profit on gross sales, compute the profit for each farmer and for each variety sold in October.

**Solution**

1. Combined sales in September and October for each farmer in each variety is given by \[\text{A}+\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}\\ \text{15,000}&30,000&36,000\\ 70,000&40,000&20,000\end{bmatrix}\] Ramkishan \[\text{A}+\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}\\ \text{15,000}&30,000&36,000\\ 70,000&40,000&20,000\end{bmatrix}\] Gurcharan Singh2. Change in sales from September to October is given by \[\begin{split}\text{A}-\text{B}=&\left[\begin{array}{cccc} \text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}\\ \text{5000}&\text{10,000}&\text{24,000}\\ \text{30,000}&\text{20,000}&\text{0}\\ \text{.}\end{array}\right]\text{Ramkishan}\\ \text{.}\end{split}\] (33) \[\begin{split} 2\%\text{ of }\text{B}=&\frac{2}{100}\times\text{B}= 0.02\times\text{B}\\ &=&0.02\left[\begin{array}{cccc}\text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{ Naura}\\ \text{5000}&\text{10,000}&\text{6000}\\ \text{20,000}&\text{10,000}&\text{10,000}\\ \text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}\\ \text{100}&\text{200}&\text{120}&\text{Ramkishan}\\ \text{400}&\text{200}&\text{200}&\text{Gurcharan Singh}\\ \end{array}\right]\text{Ramkishan}\\ &=&\left[\begin{array}{cccc}\text{Basmati}&\text{Permal}&\text{Naura}\\ \text{100}&\text{200}&\text{120}&\text{Ramkishan}\\ \text{400}&\text{200}&\text{200}&\text{Gurcharan Singh}\\ \end{array}\right]\text{Ramkishan}\end{split}\]

Thus, in October Ramkishan receives \(\$\,100\), \(\$\,200\) and \(\$\,120\) as profit in the sale of each variety of rice, respectively, and Grucharan Singh receives profit of \(\$\,400\), \(\$\,200\) and \(\$\,200\) in the sale of each variety of rice, respectively.

#### 3.4.5. Multiplication of matrices

Suppose Meera and Nadeem are two friends. Meera wants to buy 2 pens and 5 story books, while Nadeem needs 8 pens and 10 story books. They both go to a shop to enquire about the rates which are quoted as follows:

\[\text{Pen}-\$\,5\,\text{each, story book}-\$\,50\,\text{each}.\]

How much money does each need to spend? Clearly, Meera needs \(\$\,(5\times 2+50\times 5)\) that is \(\$\,260\), while Nadeem needs \((8\times 5+50\times 10)\,\$\,\), that is \(\$\,540\). In terms of matrix representation, we can write the above information as follows:

**Requirements** **Prices per piece (in Rupees)** **Money needed (in Rupees)** \[\begin{bmatrix}2&5\\ 8&10\end{bmatrix}\qquad\qquad\qquad\begin{bmatrix}5\\ 50\end{bmatrix}\qquad\qquad\qquad\begin{bmatrix}5\times 2+5\times 50\\ 8\times 5+10\times 50\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}260\\ 540\end{bmatrix}\]

Suppose that they enquire about the rates from another shop, quoted as follows:

\[\text{pen}-\$\,4\,\text{each, story book}-\$\,40\,\text{each}.\]

Now, the money required by Meera and Nadeem to make purchases will be respectively \(\$\,(4\times 2+40\times 5)=\$\,208\) and \(\$\,(8\times 4+10\times 40)=\$\,432\)

and is given by \(\text{CD}=\begin{bmatrix}1&-1&2\\ 0&3&4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&7\\ -1&1\\ 5&-4\end{bmatrix}\). This is a \(2\times 2\) matrix in which each entry is the sum of the products across some row of C with the corresponding entries down some column of D. These four computations are

Hence AB is defined. Now \[\begin{array}{l}\text{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}6(2)+9(7)&6(6)+9(9)&6(0)+9(8)\\ 2(2)+3(7)&2(6)+3(9)&2(0)+3(8)\end{bmatrix}\\ =\begin{bmatrix}12+63&36+81&0+72\\ 4+21&12+27&0+24\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}75&117&72\\ 25&39&24\end{bmatrix}\]_Remark_: If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3) rows. If A, B are, respectively \(m\times n\), \(k\times l\) matrices, then both AB and BA are defined **if and only if**\(n=k\) and \(l=m\). In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the same order, then both AB and BA are defined.

**Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices**

Now, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not necessary that AB = BA.

**Example 13**: If \(\mbox{ A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&-2&3\\ -4&2&5\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mbox{ B}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 4&5\\ 2&1\end{bmatrix}\), then find AB, BA. Show that AB \(\neq\mbox{ BA}\).

**Solution**: Since A is a \(2\times 3\) matrix and B is \(3\times 2\) matrix. Hence AB and BA are both defined and are matrices of order \(2\times 2\) and \(3\times 3\), respectively. Note that

\[\mbox{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}1&-2&3\\ -4&2&5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 4&5\\ 2&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2&8+6&3-10+3\\ -8+8+10&-12+10+5\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&-4\\ 10&3\end{bmatrix}\]

and

\[\mbox{BA}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 4&5\\ 2&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2&-12&-4+6&6+15\\ 4-20&-8+10&12+25\\ 2&-2&11\end{bmatrix}\]

Clearly AB \(\neq\mbox{ BA}\)

In the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so AB \(\neq\mbox{ BA}\). But one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of same order they may not be same.

**Example 14**: If \(\mbox{ A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&-1\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mbox{ B}=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\ 1&0\end{bmatrix}\), then \(\mbox{ AB}=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\ -1&0\end{bmatrix}\).

and

\[\mbox{BA}=\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\ 1&0\end{bmatrix}\mbox{. Clearly AB}\neq\mbox{ BA}.\]

Thus matrix multiplication is not commutative.

NoteThis does not mean that AB \(\neq\) BA for every pair of matrices A, B for which AB and BA, are defined. For instance,

If \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&2\end{bmatrix}\), \(\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\ 0&4\end{bmatrix}\), then AB = BA = \begin{bmatrix}3&0\\ 0&8\end{bmatrix}\)

Observe that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative.

Zero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices

We know that, for real numbers \(a\), \(b\) if \(ab=0\), then either \(a=0\) or \(b=0\). This need not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example.

Example 15Find AB, if \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\ 0&2\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}3&5\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}\).

SolutionWe have AB = \begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\ 0&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}3&5\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}\)= \begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}\).

Thus, if the product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of the matrices is a zero matrix.

#### 3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices

The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without proof.

1. **The associative law** For any three matrices A, B and C. We have (AB) C = A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined.
2. **The distributive law** For three matrices A, B and C. 1. A (B+C) = AB + AC 2. (A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined.
3. **The existence of multiplicative identity** For every square matrix A, there exist an identity matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A.

Now, we shall verify these properties by examples.

Example 16If \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&-1\\ 2&0&3\\ 3&-1&2\end{bmatrix}\), \(\text{B}=\begin{bmatrix}1&3\\ 0&2\\ -1&4\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\text{C}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3&-4\\ 2&0&-2&1\end{bmatrix}\), find A(BC), (AB)C and show that (AB)C = A(BC).

**Solution** We have \(\text{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&-1\\ 2&0&3\\ 3&-1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&3\\ 0&2\\ -1&4\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1+0+1&3+2-4\\ 2+0-3&6+0+12\\ 3+0-2&9-2+8\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\ -1&18\\ 1&15\end{bmatrix}\)

(AB) (C) \[=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\ -1&18\\ 1&15\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3&-4\\ 2&0&-2&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2+2&4+0&6-2&-8+1\\ -1+36&-2+0&-3-36&4+18\\ 1+30&2+0&3-30&-4+15\end{bmatrix}\]

\[=\begin{bmatrix}4&4&4&-7\\ 35&-2&-39&22\\ 31&2&-27&11\end{bmatrix}\]

Now \(\text{BC}=\begin{bmatrix}1&3\\ 0&2\\ -1&4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3&-4\\ 2&0&-2\end{bmatrix}\)

\[=\begin{bmatrix}7&2&-3\\ 4&0&-4&2\\ 7&-2&-11&8\end{bmatrix}\]

Therefore \(\text{A}(\text{BC})=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&-1\\ 2&0&3\\ 3&1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}7&2&-3&-1\\ 4&0&-4&2\\ 7&-2&-11&8\end{bmatrix}\)

\[=\begin{bmatrix}7+4-7&2+0+2&-3-4+11&-1+2-8\\ 14+0+21&4+0-6&-6+0-33&-2+0+24\\ 21-4+14&6+0-4&-9+4-22&-3-2+16\end{bmatrix}\]

\[=\begin{bmatrix}4&4&4&-7\\ 35&-2&-39&22\\ 31&2&-27&11\end{bmatrix}.\]

Clearly, (AB) C = A (BC)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:369]

So

\[A^{3}=A\,A^{2}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\ 3&-2&1\\ 4&2&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}19&4&8\\ 1&12&8\\ 14&6&15\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}63&46&69\\ 69&-6&23\\ 92&46&63\end{bmatrix}\]

**Example 21**: If \(A=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\ 4\\ 5\end{bmatrix},B=\begin{bmatrix}1&3&-6\end{bmatrix},\) verify that (AB)\({}^{\prime}=B^{\prime}A^{\prime}.\)

**Solution** We have

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\ 4\\ 5\end{bmatrix},B=\begin{bmatrix}1&3&-6\end{bmatrix}\]

then

\[AB=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\ 4\\ 5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&3&-6\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-2&-6&12\\ 4&12&-24\\ 5&15&-30\end{bmatrix}\]

Now

\[A^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}-2&4&5\end{bmatrix},\ B^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 3\\ 12&-24&-30\end{bmatrix}\]

Clearly

\[(AB)^{\prime}=B^{\prime}A^{\prime}\]

### Symmetric and Skew Symmetric Matrices

**Definition 4**: A square matrix \(A=[a_{ij}]\) is said to be _symmetric_ if \(A^{\prime}=A\), that is, \([a_{ij}]=[a_{ji}]\) for all possible values of \(i\) and \(j.\)

For example \(A=\begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{3}&2&3\\ 2&-1.5&-1\\ 3&-1&1\end{bmatrix}\) is a symmetric matrix as \(A^{\prime}=A\)

**Definition 5**: A square matrix \(A=[a_{ij}]\) is said to be _skew symmetric_ matrix if \(A^{\prime}=-A\), that is \(a_{ji}=-a_{ij}\) for all possible values of \(i\) and \(j.\) Now, if we put \(i=j,\) we have \(a_{ii}=-a_{ii}.\) Therefore \(2a_{ii}=0\) or \(a_{ii}=0\) for all \(i\)'s.

This means that all the diagonal elements of a skew symmetric matrix are zero.

For example, the matrix \(B=\begin{bmatrix}0&e&f\\ -e&0&g\\ -f&-g&0\end{bmatrix}\) is a skew symmetric matrix as \(B^{\prime}=-B\)

Now, we are going to prove some results of symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices.

**Theorem 1**: For any square matrix \(A\) with real number entries, \(A+A^{\prime}\) is a symmetric matrix and \(A-A^{\prime}\) is a skew symmetric matrix.

**Proof** Let \(B=A+A^{\prime}\), then

\[B^{\prime} = (A+A^{\prime})^{\prime}\] \[= A^{\prime}+(A^{\prime})^{\prime}\text{ (as }(A+B)^{\prime}=A^{\prime}+B^{\prime})\] \[= A^{\prime}+A\text{ (as }(A^{\prime})^{\prime}=A)\] \[= A+A^{\prime}\text{ (as }A+B^{\prime}=B+A)\] \[= B\]

Therefore \(B=A+A^{\prime}\) is a symmetric matrix

Now let

\[C = (A-A^{\prime})^{\prime}=A^{\prime}-(A^{\prime})^{\prime}\text{ (Why?)}\] \[= A^{\prime}-A\text{ (Why?)}\] \[= -(A-A^{\prime})=-C\]

Therefore \(C=A-A^{\prime}\) is a skew symmetric matrix.

**Theorem 2**: Any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

**Proof** Let \(A\) be a square matrix, then we can write

\[A=\frac{1}{2}(A+A^{\prime})+\frac{1}{2}(A-A^{\prime})\]

From the Theorem 1, we know that \((A+A^{\prime})\) is a symmetric matrix and \((A-A^{\prime})\) is a skew symmetric matrix. Since for any matrix \(A\), \((kA)^{\prime}=kA^{\prime}\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{2}(A+A^{\prime})\)is symmetric matrix and \(\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A^{\prime}}\right)\) is skew symmetric matrix. Thus, any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

**Example 22**: Express the matrix \(\mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix}2&-2&-4\\ -1&3&4\\ 1&-2&-3\end{bmatrix}\) as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

**Solution**: Here

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{B^{\prime}}&=\begin{bmatrix}2&-1&1\\ -2&3&-2\\ -4&4&-3\end{bmatrix}\end{split}\]

Let

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{P}&=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B^{ \prime}}\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}4&-3&-3\\ 3&6&2\\ -3&2&-6\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3&-3\\ 2&2&2\\ 3&1&-3\end{bmatrix},\end{split}\]

Now

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{P}&=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B^{ \prime}}\right)\text{ is a symmetric matrix.}\end{split}\]

Thus

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{Q}&=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{B}- \mathbf{B^{\prime}}\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}0&-1&-5\\ 1&0&6\\ 5&-6&0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&\dfrac{-1}{2}&\dfrac{-5}{2}\\ \dfrac{1}{2}&0&3\\ \dfrac{5}{2}&-3&0\end{bmatrix}\end{split}\]
Then

\[\mathrm{Q}^{\prime}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}0&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{5}{3}\\ \frac{-1}{2}&0&-3\\ \frac{-5}{2}&3&0\end{array}\right]=-\mathrm{Q}\]

Thus

\[\mathrm{Q}=\frac{\cdot}{2}\left(\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{B}^{\prime}\right)\text{ is a skew symmetric matrix.}\]

Now

\[\mathrm{P}+\mathrm{Q}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}2&\frac{-3}{2}&\frac{-3}{2}\\ \frac{-3}{2}&3&1\\ \frac{-3}{2}&1&-3\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccc}0&\frac{-1}{2}& \frac{-5}{2}\\ \frac{1}{2}&0&3\\ \frac{5}{2}&3&0\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}2&-2&-4\\ -1&3&4\\ 1&-2&3\end{array}\right]\]

Thus, \(\mathrm{B}\) is represented as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

1. Find the transpose of each of the following matrices:

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{(i)}\ \left[\begin{array}{c}5\\ \frac{1}{2}\\ -1\end{array}\right]\\ \text{(ii)}\ \left[\begin{array}{c}1\\ 2\end{array}\right]\\ \text{(iii)}\ \left[\begin{array}{ccc}-1&5&6\\ \sqrt{3}&5&6\\ 2&3&-1\end{array}\right]\\ \text{.}\

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:380]

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{(i)}&\begin{bmatrix}3&5\\ 1&-1\end{bmatrix}&\text{(ii)}&\begin{bmatrix}6&-2&2\\ -2&3&-1\\ 2&-1&3\end{bmatrix}\\ \text{(iii)}&\begin{bmatrix}3&3&-1\\ -2&-2&1\\ -4&-5&2\end{bmatrix}&\text{(iv)}&\begin{bmatrix}1&5\\ -1&2\end{bmatrix}\end{array}\]

Choose the correct answer in the Exercises 11 and 12.

11. If A, B are symmetric matrices of same order, then AB - BA is a (A) Skew symmetric matrix (B) Symmetric matrix (C) Zero matrix (D) Identity matrix
12. If A =\(\begin{bmatrix}\cos\alpha&-\sin\alpha\\ \sin\alpha&\cos\alpha\end{bmatrix}\), and A + A\({}^{\prime}\) = I, then the value of \(\alpha\) is. (A) \(\dfrac{\pi}{6}\) (B) \(\dfrac{\pi}{3}\) (C) \(\pi\)

### Invertible Matrices

**Definition 6** If A is a square matrix of order \(m\), and if there exists another square matrix B of the same order \(m\), such that AB = BA = I, then B is called the _inverse_ matrix of A and it is denoted by A\({}^{-1}\). In that case A is said to be invertible.

For example, let \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&2\end{bmatrix}\)and B = \(\begin{bmatrix}2&-3\\ -1&2\end{bmatrix}\)be two matrices.

Now \(\text{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&-3\\ -1&2\end{bmatrix}\)

\[=\begin{bmatrix}4-3&-6+6\\ 2-2&-3+4\end{bmatrix}\text{=}\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\text{= I}\]

Also \(\text{BA}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\) = I. Thus B is the inverse of A, in other words B = A\({}^{-1}\) and A is inverse of B, i.e., A = B\({}^{-1}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:382]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:383]

Let AB be symmetric, then (AB)\({}^{\prime}=\) AB

But (AB)\({}^{\prime}=\) B\({}^{\prime}\)A\({}^{\prime}\)= BA (Why?)

Therefore BA = AB

Conversely, if AB = BA, then we shall show that AB is symmetric.

Now (AB)\({}^{\prime}=\) B\({}^{\prime}\)A\({}^{\prime}\)

\[=\) B A (as A and B are symmetric)

\[=\) AB

Hence AB is symmetric.

**Example 25**: Let A = \begin{bmatrix}2&-1\\ 3&4\end{bmatrix}\), B = \begin{bmatrix}5&2\\ 7&4\end{bmatrix}\), C = \begin{bmatrix}2&5\\ 3&8\end{bmatrix}\). Find a matrix D such that CD - AB = O.

**Solution**: Since A, B, C are all square matrices of order 2, and CD - AB is well defined, D must be a square matrix of order 2.

Let

\[\text{D}=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{bmatrix}\]

. Then CD - AB = 0 gives

or

\[\begin{bmatrix}2a+5c-3&2b+5d\\ 3a+8c-43&3b+8d-22\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}\]

By equality of matrices, we get

\[2a+5c-3 = 0... \tag{1}\] \[3a+8c-43 = 0...\] (2) \[2b+5d = 0...\] (3) \[3b+8d-22 = 0... \tag{4}\]

Solving (1) and (2), we get \(a=-191\), \(c=77\). Solving (3) and (4), we get \(b=-110\), \(d=44\).

Therefore

\[\text{D}=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-191&-110\\ 77&44\end{bmatrix}\]

#### Miscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 3

A is a symmetric matrix if A\({}^{\prime}\) = A.

A is a skew symmetric matrix if A\({}^{\prime}\) = A.

Any square matrix can be represented as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like

\[\begin{array}{c}a_{1}\ x+b_{1}\ y=c_{1}\\ a_{2}\ x+b_{2}\ y=c_{2}\end{array}\]

can be represented as \(\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&b_{1}\\ a_{2}&b_{2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}\\ c_{2}\end{bmatrix}\). Now, this system of equations has a unique solution or not, is determined by the number \(a_{1}\ b_{2}-a_{2}\ b_{1}\). (Recall that if \(\dfrac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}\neq\dfrac{b_{1}}{b_{2}}\) or, \(a_{1}\ b_{2}-a_{2}\ b_{1}\neq 0\), then the system of linear equations has a unique solution). The number \(a_{1}\ b_{2}-a_{2}\ b_{1}\) which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix \(\ \mathrm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&b_{1}\\ a_{2}&b_{2}\end{bmatrix}\) and is called the determinant of \(\mathrm{A}\) or \(\mathrm{det}\ \mathrm{A}\). Determinants have wide applications in Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.

In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries. Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix, consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.

### Determinant

To every square matrix \(\mathrm{A}=[a_{ij}]\) of order \(n\), we can associate a number (real or complex) called determinant of the square matrix \(\mathrm{A}\), where \(a_{ij}=(i,j)^{\mathrm{th}}\) element of \(\mathrm{A}\).

3 corresponding to each of three rows (R\({}_{1}\), R\({}_{2}\) and R\({}_{3}\)) and three columns (C\({}_{1}\), C\({}_{2}\) and C\({}_{3}\)) giving the same value as shown below.

Consider the determinant of square matrix A = [_a\({}_{i_{j}}\)]\({}_{3\times 3}\)_

i.e.,

**Expansion along first Row (R\({}_{1}\))**

Step 1 Multiply first element _a\({}_{11}\)_ of R\({}_{1}\) by (-1)\({}^{(1\,+\,1)}\) [(-1)\({}^{\text{sum of suffixes in }a_{11}}\)] and with the second order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row (R\({}_{1}\)) and first column (C\({}_{1}\)) of \(|\) A \(|\) as _a\({}_{11}\)_ lies in R\({}_{1}\) and C\({}_{1}\),

i.e.,

Step 2 Multiply 2nd element _a\({}_{12}\)_ of R\({}_{1}\) by (-1)\({}^{1\,+\,2}\); [(-1)\({}^{\text{sum of suffixes in }a_{12}}\)] and the second order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R\({}_{1}\)) and 2nd column (C\({}_{2}\)) of \(|\) A \(|\) as _a\({}_{12}\)_ lies in R\({}_{1}\) and C\({}_{2}\),

i.e.,

Step 3 Multiply third element _a\({}_{13}\)_ of R\({}_{1}\) by (-1)\({}^{1\,+\,3}\) [(-1)\({}^{\text{sum of suffixes in }a_{12}}\)] and the second order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R\({}_{1}\)) and third column (C\({}_{3}\)) of \(|\) A \(|\) as _a\({}_{13}\)_ lies in R\({}_{1}\) and C\({}_{3}\),

i.e.,

### Minors and Cofactors

In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form using minors and cofactors.

**Definition 1** Minor of an element \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\) of a determinant is the determinant obtained by deleting its \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column in which element \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\) lies. Minor of an element \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\) is denoted by \(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!g}}\).

_Remark_ Minor of an element of a determinant of order \(n(n\geq 2)\) is a determinant of order \(n-1\).

**Example 8** Find the minor of element 6 in the determinant \(\Delta=\begin{array}{c|cc}1&2&3\\ 4&5&6\\ 7&8&9\end{array}\)

**Solution** Since 6 lies in the second row and third column, its minor \(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!23}}\) is given by

\[\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!23}}=\begin{array}{c|cc}1&2\\ 7&8\end{array}=8-14=-6\ (\text{obtained by deleting $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ in $\Delta$}).\]

**Definition 2** Cofactor of an element \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\), denoted by \(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!g}}\) is defined by

\[\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!g}}=(-1)^{i+j}\ \mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!g}},\text{where $\mathrm{M}_{ \!g}$ is minor of $a_{{}_{\!g}}$}.\]

**Example 9** Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant \(\begin{array}{c|cc}1&-2\\ 4&3\end{array}\)

**Solution** Minor of the element \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\) is \(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!g}}\)

Here \(a_{{}_{\!11}}=1\). So \(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!11}}=\text{Minor of $a_{{}_{\!11}}$}=3\)

\(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!12}}=\text{Minor of the element $a_{{}_{\!12}}=4$}\)

\(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!21}}=\text{Minor of the element $a_{{}_{\!21}}=-2$}\)

\(\mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!22}}=\text{Minor of the element $a_{{}_{\!22}}=1$}\)

Now, cofactor of \(a_{{}_{\!g}}\) is \(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!g}}\). So

\(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!11}}=(-1)^{1+1}\ \mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!11}}=(-1)^{2}\ (3)=3\)

\(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!12}}=(-1)^{1+2}\ \mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!12}}=(-1)^{3}\ (4)=-4\)

\(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!21}}=(-1)^{2+1}\ \mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!21}}=(-1)^{3}\ (-2)=2\)

\(\mathrm{A}_{{}_{\!22}}=(-1)^{2+2}\ \mathrm{M}_{{}_{\!22}}=(-1)^{4}\ (1)=1\)

**Example 10**: Find minors and cofactors of the elements \(a_{{}_{11}}\), \(a_{{}_{21}}\) in the determinant

\[\Delta=\begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}\]

**Solution** By definition of minors and cofactors, we have

\[\text{Minor of }a_{{}_{11}}=\text{M}_{{}_{11}}=\begin{vmatrix}a_{22}&a_{23} \\ a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}=a_{22}\ a_{33}-a_{23}\ a_{32}\] \[\text{Cofactor of }a_{{}_{11}}=\text{A}_{{}_{11}}=(-1)^{{}_{1+1}}\ \ \text{M}_{{}_{11}}=a_{22}\ a_{33}-a_{23}\ a_{32}\] \[\text{Minor of }a_{{}_{21}}=\text{M}_{{}_{21}}=\begin{vmatrix}a_{12}&a_{1 3}\\ a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}=a_{12}\ a_{33}-a_{13}\ a_{32}\] \[\text{Cofactor of }a_{{}_{21}}=\text{A}_{{}_{21}}=(-1)^{{}_{2+1}}\ \ \text{M}_{{}_{21}}=(-1)\ (a_{12}a_{33}-a_{13}a_{32})=a_{12}\ a_{33}+a_{13}\ a_{32}\]

_Remark_ Expanding the determinant \(\Delta\), in Example 21, along \(\text{R}_{{}_{1}}\), we have

\[\Delta =(-1)^{{}_{1+1}}\ a_{{}_{11}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}+(-1)^{{}_{1+2}}\ a_{{}_{12}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{21}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}+(-1)^{{}_{1+3}}\ a_{{}_{13}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{21}&a_{22}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}\end{vmatrix}\] \[=a_{{}_{11}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{11}}+a_{{}_{12}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{12}}+a _{{}_{13}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{13}}\,\text{where }\text{A}_{{}_{\beta}}\text{ is cofactor of }a_{{}_{\beta}}\] \[=\text{sum of product of elements of }\text{R}_{{}_{1}}\text{ with their corresponding cofactors}\]

Similarly, \(\Delta\) can be calculated by other five ways of expansion that is along \(\text{R}_{{}_{2}}\), \(\text{R}_{{}_{3}}\), \(\text{C}_{{}_{1}}\), \(\text{C}_{{}_{2}}\) and \(\text{C}_{{}_{3}}\).

Hence \(\Delta=\text{sum of the product of elements of any row (or column) with their corresponding cofactors.

NoteIf elements of a row (or column) are multiplied with cofactors of any other row (or column), then their sum is zero. For example,

\[\Delta =a_{{}_{11}}\ \text{A}_{{}_{21}}+a_{{}_{12}}\ \text{A}_{{}_{22}}+a_{{}_{13}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{23}}\] \[=a_{{}_{11}}\ (-1)^{{}_{1+1}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}+a_{{}_{12}}\ (-1)^{{}_{1+2}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a_{13}\\ a_{31}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}+a_{{}_{13}}\ (-1)^{{}_{1+3}}\ \begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}\end{vmatrix}\] \[=\begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}=0\ (\text{since }\ \text{R}_{{}_{1}}\text{ and }\text{R}_{{}_{2}}\text{ are identical})\]

Similarly, we can try for other rows and columns.

**Example 11**: Find minors and cofactors of the elements of the determinant

\[\begin{vmatrix}2&-3&5\\ 6&0&4\\ 1&5&-7\end{vmatrix}\text{ and verify that }a_{{}_{11}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{31}}+a_{{}_{12}}\, \text{A}_{{}_{32}}+a_{{}_{13}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{33}}\text{= }0\]

**Solution** We have \(\text{M}_{{}_{11}}=\begin{vmatrix}0&4\\ 5&-7\end{vmatrix}=0\,-20=-20\); \(\text{A}_{{}_{11}}=(-1)^{{}^{1+1}}\,(-20)=-20\)

\[\text{M}_{{}_{12}}=\begin{vmatrix}6&4\\ 1&-7\end{vmatrix}=-42-4=-46;\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{12}}=(-1)^{{}^{1+2}}(-46)=46 \text{.}\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{13}}=\begin{vmatrix}6&0\\ 1&5\end{vmatrix}=30-0=30;\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{13}}=(-1)^{{}^{1+3}} \,(30)=30\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{21}}=\begin{vmatrix}-3&5\\ 5&-7\end{vmatrix}=21-25=-4;\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{21}}=(-1)^{{}^{2+1}}(-4)=4\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{22}}=\begin{vmatrix}2&5\\ 1&-7\end{vmatrix}=-14-5=-19;\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{22}}=(-1)^{{}^{2+2}}(-19)=-19\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{23}}=\begin{vmatrix}2&-3\\ 1&5\end{vmatrix}=10+3=13;\qquad\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{23}}=(-1)^{{}^{2+3}}(13)=-13\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{31}}=\begin{vmatrix}-3&5\\ 0&4\end{vmatrix}=-12-0=-12;\qquad\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{31}}=(-1)^{{}^{3+1}}(-12)=-12\]

\[\text{M}_{{}_{32}}=\begin{vmatrix}2&5\\ 6&4\end{vmatrix}=8-30=-22;\qquad\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{32}}=(-1)^{{}^{3+2}}(-22)=22\]

and

\[\text{M}_{{}_{33}}=\begin{vmatrix}2&-3\\ 6&0\end{vmatrix}=0+18=18;\qquad\qquad\text{A}_{{}_{33}}=(-1)^{{}^{3+3}}(18)=18\]

Now

\[\begin{array}{ll}a_{{}_{11}}=2,\,a_{{}_{12}}=-3,\,a_{{}_{13}}=5;\,\,\,\text{ A}_{{}_{31}}=-12,\,\text{A}_{{}_{32}}=22,\,\text{A}_{{}_{33}}=18\end{array}\]

So

\[\begin{array}{ll}a_{{}_{11}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{31}}+a_{{}_{12}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{32 }}+a_{{}_{13}}\,\text{A}_{{}_{33}}\\ =2\,(-12)+(-3)\,(22)+5\,(18)=-24-66+90=0\end{array}\]Write Minors and Cofactors of the elements of following determinants:

1. (i) \(\begin{bmatrix}2&-4\\ 0&3\end{bmatrix}\) (ii) \(\begin{bmatrix}a&c\\ b&d\end{bmatrix}\)
2. (i) \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\) (ii) \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&4\\ 3&5&-1\\ 0&1&2\end{bmatrix}\)
3. Using Cofactors of elements of second row, evaluate \(\Delta=\begin{bmatrix}5&3&8\\ 2&0&1\end{bmatrix}\)
4. Using Cofactors of elements of third column, evaluate \(\Delta=\begin{bmatrix}5&\text{If }\Delta=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\text{A}_{\mu}\) is Cofactors of \(a_{\mu}\), then value of \(\Delta\) is given by (A) \(a_{11}\,\text{A}_{31}+\,a_{12}\,\text{A}_{32}+\,a_{13}\,\text{A}_{33}\) (B) \(a_{11}\,\text{A}_{11}+\,a_{12}\,\text{A}_{21}+\,a_{13}\,\text{A}_{31}\) (C) \(a_{21}\,\text{A}_{11}+\,a_{22}\,\text{A}_{12}+\,a_{23}\,\text{A}_{13}\) (D) \(a_{11}\,\text{A}_{11}+\,a_{21}\,\text{A}_{21}+\,a_{31}\,\text{A}_{31}\)

### Adjoint and Inverse of a Matrix

In the previous chapter, we have studied inverse of a matrix. In this section, we shall discuss the condition for existence of inverse of a matrix.

To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., \(\text{A}^{-1}\) we shall first define adjoint of a matrix.

#### 4.5.1 Adjoint of a matrix

**Definition 3**: The adjoint of a square matrix \(\text{A}=[a_{\mu}]_{n\,\times\,n}\) is defined as the transpose of the matrix \([\text{A}_{\mu}]_{n\,\times\,n}\), where \(\text{A}_{\mu}\) is the cofactor of the element \(a_{\mu}\). Adjoint of the matrix A is denoted by _adj_ A.

Let

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{bmatrix}\]\[\text{.}\]

Then _adj_ A = Transpose of \(\begin{bmatrix}\text{A}_{11}&\text{A}_{12}&\text{A}_{13}\\ \text{A}_{21}&\text{A}_{22}&\text{A}_{23}\\ \text{A}_{31}&\text{A}_{32}&\text{A}_{33}\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}\text{A}_{11}&\text{A}_{21}&\text{A}_{31}\\ \text{A}_{12}&\text{A}_{22}&\text{A}_{32}\\ \text{A}_{13}&\text{A}_{23}&\text{A}_{33}\end{bmatrix}\)

**Example 12**: Find _adj_ A for A = \(\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&4\end{bmatrix}\)

**Solution** We have \(\text{A}_{11}=4\), \(\text{A}_{12}=-1\), \(\text{A}_{21}=-3\), \(\text{A}_{22}=2\)

Hence

_Remark_ For a square matrix of order 2, given by

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}\end{bmatrix}\]

The _adj_ A can also be obtained by interchanging \(a_{11}\) and \(a_{22}\) and by changing signs of \(a_{12}\) and \(a_{21}\), i.e.,

We state the following theorem without proof.

**Theorem 1**: If A be any given square matrix of order \(n\), then

\[\text{A}(\textit{adj}\text{A})=(\textit{adj}\text{A})\text{A}=\big{|}\text{A} \big{|}\text{I}\,,\]

where I is the identity matrix of order \(n\)

**Verification**

Let

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{bmatrix}\text{, then }\textit{adj}\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix} \text{A}_{11}&\text{A}_{21}&\text{A}_{31}\\ \text{A}_{12}&\text{A}_{22}&\text{A}_{32}\\ \text{A}_{13}&\text{A}_{23}&\text{A}_{33}\end{bmatrix}\]

Since sum of product of elements of a row (or a column) with corresponding cofactors is equal to \(|\text{A}\,|\) and otherwise zero, we have \[\text{A}\;(adj\;\text{A})=\begin{bmatrix}\left|\text{A}\right|&0&0\\ 0&\left|\text{A}\right|&0\\ 0&0&\left|\text{A}\right|\end{bmatrix}=\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}=\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\;\text{I}\]

Similarly, we can show \(\;(adj\;\text{A})\;\text{A}=\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\;\text{I}\)

Hence A \((adj\;\text{A})=(adj\;\text{A})\;\text{A}=\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\; \text{I}\)

**Definition 4** A square matrix A is said to be singular if \(\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}=0\).

For example, the determinant of matrix A = \(\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\ 4&8\end{bmatrix}\) is zero

Hence A is a singular matrix.

**Definition 5** A square matrix A is said to be non-singular if \(\left|\text{A}\right|\neq 0\)

Let

\[\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\ 3&4\end{bmatrix}\text{. Then }\left|\text{A}\right|=\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\ 3&4\end{bmatrix}=4-6=2\neq 0\text{.}\]

Hence A is a nonsingular matrix

We state the following theorems without proof.

**Theorem 2** If A and B are nonsingular matrices of the same order, then AB and BA are also nonsingular matrices of the same order.

**Theorem 3** The determinant of the product of matrices is equal to product of their respective determinants, that is, \(\left|\text{AB}\right|=\left|\text{A}\right|\;\left|\text{B}\right|\), where A and B are square matrices of the same order

_Remark_ We know that \((adj\;\text{A})\;\text{A}=\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\;\text{I}=\begin{bmatrix} \left|\text{A}\right|&0&0\\ 0&\left|\text{A}\right|&0\\ 0&0&\left|\text{A}\right|\end{bmatrix}\),\(\left|\text{A}\right|\neq 0\)

Writing determinants of matrices on both sides, we have

\[\dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}\;\text{A}\;\text{A}\;\text{A}=\begin{vmatrix} \dot{\left|\text{A}\right|}&0&0\\ 0&\left|\text{A}\right|&0\\ 0&0&\left|\text{A}\right|\end{vmatrix}\]i.e.

\[|(adj\text{ A})|\text{ }|\text{ A}|=\begin{vmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\end{vmatrix}\] (Why?)

i.e.

\[|(adj\text{ A})|\text{ }|\text{ A}|=|\text{ A}|^{3}\text{ (1)}\]

i.e.

\[|(adj\text{ A})|=|\text{ A}|^{2}\]

In general, if A is \(a\) square matrix of order \(n\), then \(|adj(\text{ A})|=|\text{ A}|^{n-1}\).

**Theorem 4** A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.

**Proof** Let A be invertible matrix of order \(n\) and I be the identity matrix of order \(n\). Then, there exists a square matrix B of order \(n\) such that \(\text{AB}=\text{BA}=\text{I}\)

Now

\[\text{AB}=\text{I}.\text{ So }\left|\text{AB}\right|=\left|\text{I}\right| \text{ or }\left|\text{A}\right|\text{ }\left|\text{B}\right|=1\text{ (since }\left|\text{I}\right|=1,\text{AB}=\left|\text{A}\right| \text{B}\right|)\]

This gives

\[\left|\text{A}\right|\neq 0.\]

Hence A is nonsingular.

Conversely, let A be nonsingular. Then

Now

\[\text{A}\text{ (}adj\text{ A})=(adj\text{ A})\text{ A}=\left|\text{A}\right| \text{ I}\]

or

\[\text{AB}=\text{BA}=\text{I},\text{ where }\text{B}=\frac{1}{|\text{ A}|}adj\text{ A}\]

Thus

\[\text{A}\text{ is invertible and }\text{A}^{-1}=\frac{1}{|\text{ A}|}adj\text{ A}\]

**Example 13** If \(\text{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&3&3\\ 1&4&3\\ 1&3&4\end{bmatrix},\) then verify that A \(adj\text{ A}=|\text{ A}|\text{ I}.\) Also find \(\text{A}^{-1}.\)

**Solution** We have \(|\text{A}|=1\left(16-9\right)-3\left(4-3\right)+3\left(3-4\right)=1\neq 0\)

Now \(\text{A}_{11}=7,\text{ A}_{12}=-1,\text{ A}_{13}=-1,\text{ A}_{21}=-3,\text{ A}_{22}=1,\text{A}_{23}=0,\text{ A}_{31}=-3,\text{ A}_{32}=0,\)

\(\text{A}_{33}=1\)

Therefore

\[adj\text{ A}=\begin{bmatrix}7&-3&-3\\ -1&1&0\\ -1&0&1\end{bmatrix}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:404]

**Example 15**: Show that the matrix \(\mathrm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&2\end{bmatrix}\) satisfies the equation \(\mathrm{A}^{2}-\ 4\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{O}\), where \(\mathrm{I}\) is \(2\times 2\) identity matrix and \(\mathrm{O}\) is \(2\times 2\) zero matrix. Using this equation, find \(\mathrm{A}^{-1}\).

**Solution**: We have \(\mathrm{A}^{2}=\mathrm{A}.\mathrm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 1&2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}7&12\\ 4&7\end{bmatrix}\).

Hence \(\mathrm{A}^{2}-4\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{I}=\begin{bmatrix}7&12\\ 4&7\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}8&12\\ 4&8\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}=\mathrm{O}\)

Now \(\mathrm{A}^{2}-4\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{O}\)

Therefore \(\mathrm{A}\,\mathrm{A}-4\mathrm{A}=-\mathrm{I}\)

or \(\mathrm{A}\,\mathrm{A}\,\mathrm{A}\,(\mathrm{A}^{-1})-4\,\mathrm{A}\,\mathrm{A }^{-1}=-\mathrm{I}\,\mathrm{A}^{-1}\) (Post multiplying by \(\mathrm{A}^{-1}\) because \(|\mathrm{A}|\neq 0\)) or \(\mathrm{A}\,(\mathrm{A}\,\mathrm{A}^{-1})-4\mathrm{I}=-\mathrm{A}^{-1}\)

or \(\mathrm{A}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}2&-3\\ -1&2\end{bmatrix}\)

Find adjoint of each of the matrices in Exercises 1 and 2.

1. \(\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\ 3&4\end{bmatrix}\)

11. \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&\cos\alpha&\sin\alpha\\ 0&\sin\alpha&-\cos\alpha\end{bmatrix}\)
12. Let \(A=\begin{bmatrix}3&7\\ 2&5\end{bmatrix}\) and \(B=\begin{bmatrix}6&8\\ 7&9\end{bmatrix}\). Verify that \((AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}\).
13. If \(A=\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\ -1&2\end{bmatrix}\), show that \(A^{2}-5A+7I=O\). Hence find \(A^{-1}\).

18. If \(A\) is an invertible matrix of order \(2\), then det (A\({}^{-1}\)) is equal to (A) det (A) \(\dfrac{1}{\det\,(A)}\) (C) \(1\) (D) \(0\)

### Applications of Determinants and Matrices

In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of the system of linear equations.

**Consistent system** A system of equations is said to be _consistent_ if its solution (one or more) exists.

**Inconsistent system** A system of equations is said to be _inconsistent_ if its solution does not exist.

Note In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations having unique solutions only.

#### 4.6.1 Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix

Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using inverse of the coefficient matrix.

Consider the system of equations

Let

Then, the system of equations can be written as,, i.e.,

Case I If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now

or

(A-1)

(AX)

(B )

(by associative property) or

X

(A-1 B )

This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as Matrix Method.

Case II If A is a singular matrix, then.

In this case, we calculate (_adj_ A) B.

If (_adj_ A) B \(\neq\) O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the system of equations is called inconsistent.

If (_adj_ A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.

**Example 16**: Solve the system of equations

\[\begin{array}{l}2x+5y=1\\ 3x+2y=7\end{array}\]

**Solution** The system of equations can be written in the form \(\mathrm{AX}=\mathrm{B}\), where

\[\mathrm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}2&5\\ 3&2\end{bmatrix},\mathrm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix}\text{and }\mathrm{B}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 7\end{bmatrix}\]

Now, \(\dot{\left|\mathbf{A}\right|}=-11\neq 0\), Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.

Note that

\[\mathrm{A}^{-1}=-\frac{1}{11}\begin{bmatrix}2&-5\\ -3&2\end{bmatrix}\]

Therefore

\[\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{A}^{-1}\mathrm{B}=\frac{1}{11}\begin{bmatrix}2&-5\\ -3&2\end{bmatrix}\]

i.e.

Hence

**Example 17**: Solve the following system of equations by matrix method.

\[\begin{array}{l}3x+2y+3z=8\\ 2x+y-z=1\\ 4x-3y+2z=4\end{array}\]

**Solution** The system of equations can be written in the form \(\mathrm{AX}=\mathrm{B}\), where

\[\mathrm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}3&-2&3\\ 2&1&-1\\ 4&-3&2\end{bmatrix},\mathrm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\\ z\end{bmatrix}\text{and }\mathrm{B}=\begin{bmatrix}8\\ 1\\ 4\end{bmatrix}\]

We see that

\[\dot{\left|\mathbf{A}\right|}=3\ (2-3)+2(4+4)+3\ (-6-4)=-17\neq 0\]

Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{A}_{{}_{11}}=-1,\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{21}}=-5,\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{31}}=-1,\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{32}}=9,\end{array}\qquad\qquad\qquad\mathrm{A}_{{}_{13}}=-10\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{13}}=10,\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{23}}=11,\\ \mathrm{A}_{{}_{33}}=9,\end{array}\]

### Historical Note

The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant _Mikami, China_, _pp_ 30, 93.

Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth century in his work '_Kai Fukudai no Ho_' in 1683 showed that he had the idea of determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous linear equations. T. Hayashi, "_The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese Mathematics_," in the proc. of the Tokyo Math, Soc., V.

Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions. He may be called the formal founder, Laplace (1772), gave general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his theory of numbers.

The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of \(m\)-columns and \(n\)-rows, which for the special case of \(m=n\) reduces to the multiplication theorem.

Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He used the word 'determinant' in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication theorem more satisfactory than Binet's.

The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after this the word determinant received its final acceptance.

### Introduction

This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and relations between them. We will also learn differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we will learn some fundamental theorems in this area.

### Continuity (1642-1727)

We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider the function

\[f(x)=1,\text{if }x\leq 0\]

\[2,\text{if }x>0\]

This function is of course defined at every point of the real line. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the graph that the value of the function at _nearby_ points on \(x\)-axis remain _close_ to each other except at \(x=0\). At the points near and to the left of \(0\), i.e., at points like \(-0.1,-0.01,-0.001\), the value of the function is \(1\). At the points near and to the right of \(0\), i.e., at points like \(0.1,0.01\),0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of \(f\) at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value of the function at \(x=0\) concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at \(x=0\).

Now, consider the function defined as

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}1,\text{if }\ x\neq 0\\ 2,\text{if }\ x=0\end{cases}\]

This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at \(x=0\) are both equal to 1. But the value of the function at \(x=0\) equals 2 which does not coincide with the common value of the left and right hand limits. Again, we note that we cannot draw the graph of the function without lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of a function being not continuous at \(x=0\).

Naively, we may say that a function is continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the graph of the function _around_ that point without, lifting the pen from the plane of the paper.

Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows:

**Definition 1**: Suppose \(f\) is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let \(c\) be a point in the domain of \(f\). Then \(f\) is continuous at \(c\) if

\[\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)\]

More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function at \(x=c\) exist and equal to each other, then \(f\) is said to be continuous at \(x=c\). Recall that if the right hand and left hand limits at \(x=c\) coincide, then we say that the common value is the limit of the function at \(x=c\). Hence we may also rephrase the definition of continuity as follows: _a function is continuous at \(x=c\) if the function is defined at \(x=c\) and if the value of the function at \(x=c\) equals the limit of the function at \(x=c\)._ If \(f\) is not continuous at \(c\), we say \(f\) is _discontinuous_ at \(c\) and \(c\) is called a _point of discontinuity_ of \(f\).

**Example 1**: Check the continuity of the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=2x+3\) at \(x=1\).

**Solution**: First note that the function is defined at the given point \(x=1\) and its value is \(5\). Then find the limit of the function at \(x=1\). Clearly

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 1}(2x+3)=2(1)+3=5\]

Thus \(\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1}f(x)=5=f(1)\)

Hence, \(f\) is continuous at \(x=1\).

**Example 2**: Examine whether the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=x^{2}\) is continuous at \(x=0\).

**Solution**: First note that the function is defined at the given point \(x=0\) and its value is \(0\). Then find the limit of the function at \(x=0\). Clearly

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}x^{2}=0^{2}=0\]

Thus \(\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=0=f(0)\)

Hence, \(f\) is continuous at \(x=0\).

**Example 3**: Discuss the continuity of the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=|\ x|\) at \(x=0\).

**Solution**: By definition

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}(-x)=0\]

Similarly, the right hand limit of \(f\) at \(0\) is

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0^{*}}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 0^{*}}x=0\]

Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at \(x=0\). Hence, \(f\) is continuous at \(x=0\).

**Example 4**: Show that the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=\mathop{\begin{cases}x^{3}+3,&\text{if }x\neq 0\\ 1,&\text{if }x=0\end{cases}}\]

is not continuous at \(x=0\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:420]

**Example 7**: Is the function defined by \(f(x)=\mid x\mid\), a continuous function?

**Solution**: We may rewrite \(f\) as

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}-x,\text{ if }x<0\\ x,\text{ \ if }x\geq 0\end{cases}\]

By Example 3, we know that \(f\) is continuous at \(x=0\).

Let \(c\) be a real number such that \(c<0\). Then \(f(c)=-c\). Also

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}(-x)=-c\] (Why?)

Since \(\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=f(c)\), \(f\) is continuous at all negative real numbers.

Now, let \(c\) be a real number such that \(c>0\). Then \(f(c)=c\). Also

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}x=c\] (Why?)

Since \(\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=f(c)\), \(f\) is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, \(f\) is continuous at all points.

**Example 8**: Discuss the continuity of the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}-1\).

**Solution**: Clearly \(f\) is defined at every real number \(e\) and its value at \(c\) is \(c^{3}+c^{2}-1\). We also know that

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}(x^{3}+x^{2}-1)=c^{3}+c^{2}-1\]

Thus \(\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=f(c)\), and hence \(f\) is continuous at every real number. This means \(f\) is a continuous function.

**Example 9**: Discuss the continuity of the function \(f\) defined by \(f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}\), \(x\neq 0\).

**Solution**: Fix any non zero real number \(c\), we have

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}\dfrac{1}{x}=\dfrac{1}{c}\]

Also, since for \(c\neq 0\), \(f(c)=\dfrac{1}{c}\), we have \(\dot{\lim_{x\to c}}f(x)=f(c)\) and hence, \(f\) is continuous at every point in the domain of \(f\). Thus \(f\) is a continuous function.

We take this opportunity to explain the concept of _infinity_. This we do by analysing the function \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\) near \(x=0\). To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of finding the value of the function at real numbers _close_ to 0. Essentially we are trying to find the right hand limit of \(f\)at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 0.3 & 0.2 & \(0.1=10^{-1}\) & \(0.01=10^{-2}\) & \(0.001=10^{-3}\) & \(10^{-n}\) \\ \hline \(f(x)\) & 1 & 3.333... & 5 & 10 & \(100=10^{2}\) & \(1000=10^{3}\) & \(10^{n}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

We observe that as \(x\) gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of \(f(x)\) shoots up higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of \(f(x)\) may be made larger than any given number by choosing a positive real number _very close_ to 0. In symbols, we write

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)}=+\infty\]

(to be read as: the right hand limit of \(f(x)\) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise that \(+\infty\) is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of \(f\)at 0 does not exist (as a real number).

Similarly, the left hand limit of \(f\) at 0 may be found. The following table is self explanatory.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(-1\) & \(-0.3\) & \(-0.2\) & \(-10^{-1}\) & \(-10^{-2}\) & \(-10^{-3}\) & \(-10^{-n}\) \\ \hline \(f(x)\) & \(-1\) & \(-3.333...\) & \(-5\) & \(-10\) & \(-10^{2}\) & \(-10^{3}\) & \(-10^{n}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the value of \(f(x)\) may be made smaller than any given number by choosing a negative real number _very close_ to 0. In symbols, we write

\[\dot{\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)}=-\infty\]

(to be read as: the left hand limit of \(f(x)\) at 0 is minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise that \(-\infty\) is NOT a real number and hence the left hand limit of \(f\)at 0 does not exist (as a real number). The graph of the reciprocal function given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation of the above mentioned facts.

**Example 10**: Discuss the continuity of the function \(f\) defined by

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}x+2,\text{if }x\leq 1\\ x-2,\text{if }x>1\end{cases}\]

**Solution**: The function \(f\) is defined at all points of the real line.

**Case 1**: If \(c<1\), then \(f(c)=c+2\). Therefore, \(\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to c}(x+2)=c+2\)

Thus, \(f\) is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.

**Case 2**: If \(c>1\), then \(f(c)=c-2\). Therefore,

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to c}\ (x-2)=c-2=f(c)\]

Thus, \(f\) is continuous at all points \(x>1\).

**Case 3**: If \(c=1\), then the left hand limit of \(f\) at \(x=1\) is

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1}(x+2)=1+2=3\]

The right hand limit of \(f\) at \(x=1\) is

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}(x-2)=1=2=-1\]

Since the left and right hand limits of \(f\) at \(x=1\), \(f\) do not coincide, \(f\) is not continuous at \(x=1\). Hence

\(x=1\) is the only point of discontinuity of \(f\). The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4.

**Example 11**: Find all the points of discontinuity of the function \(f\) defined by

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}x+2,\text{if }x<1\\ 0,\text{if }x=1\\ x=2,\text{if }x>1\end{cases}\]

**Solution**: As in the previous example we find that \(f\) is continuous at all real numbers \(x\neq 1\). The left hand limit of \(f\) at \(x=1\) is

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}(x+2)=1+2=3\]

The right hand limit of \(f\) at \(x=1\) is

\[\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}f(x)=\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 1^{*}}(x-2)=1-2=-1\]

Since, the left and right hand limits of \(f\) at \(x=1\) do not coincide, \(f\)is not continuous at \(x=1\). Hence

\(x=1\) is the only point of discontinuity of \(f\). The graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5.

**Example 12**: Discuss the continuity of the function defined by

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ x+2,\,\text{if}\,\,\,x<0\\ -x+2,\,\text{if}\,\,x>0\end{array}\end{cases}\]

SolutionObserve that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0. Domain of definition of this function is

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{D}_{{}_{1}}\cup\text{D}_{{}_{2}}\text{ where }\,\,\text{D}_{{}_{1}}=\{x\in\mathbf{R}:x<0\}\text{ and }\\ \text{D}_{{}_{2}}=\{x\in\mathbf{R}:x>0\}\end{array}\]

**Case 1** If \(c\in\text{D}_{{}_{1}}\), then \(\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to c}\,\,(x+2)\)

\(=c+2=f(c)\) and hence \(f\) is continuous in \(\text{D}_{{}_{1}}\).

**Case 2** If \(c\in\text{D}_{{}_{2}}\), then \(\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to c}\,\,(-x+2)\)

\(=-c+2=f(c)\) and hence \(f\) is continuous in \(\text{D}_{{}_{2}}\).

Since \(f\)is continuous at all points in the domain of \(f\), we deduce that \(f\) is continuous. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph this function we need to lift the pen from the plane of the paper, but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not defined.

**Example 13**: Discuss the continuity of the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}\dot{x},&\text{if}\,\,x\geq 0\\ x^{2},&\text{if}\,\,x<0\end{cases}\]

SolutionClearly the function is defined at every real number. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.7. By inspection, it seems prudent to partition the domain of definition of \(f\) into three disjoint subsets of the real line.

Let \(\text{D}_{{}_{1}}=\{x\in\mathbf{R}:x<0\}\), \(\text{D}_{{}_{2}}=\{0\}\) and \(\text{D}_{{}_{3}}=\{x\in\mathbf{R}:x>0\}\)

**Case 1** At any point in \(\text{D}_{{}_{1}}\), we have \(f(x)=x^{2}\) and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see Example 2).

**Case 2** At any point in \(\text{D}_{{}_{3}}\), we have \(f(x)=x\) and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see Example 6).

**Case 3** Now we analyse the function at \(x=0\). The value of the function at \(0\) is \(f(0)=0\). The left hand limit of \(f\) at \(0\) is

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}x^{2}=0^{2}=0\end{array}\]

The right hand limit of \(f\) at \(0\) is

\[\begin{array}{l}\cdot\\ \lim_{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}x=0\end{array}\]

Thus \(\mathop{\lim}\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=0=f(0)\) and hence \(f\) is continuous at \(0\). This means that \(f\) is continuous at every point in its domain and hence, \(f\) is a continuous function.

**Example 14** Show that every polynomial function is continuous.

**Solution** Recall that a function \(p\) is a polynomial function if it is defined by \(p(x)=a_{{}_{0}}+a_{{}_{1}}x+...+a_{{}_{n}}x^{n}\) for some natural number \(n\), \(a_{{}_{n}}\neq 0\) and \(a_{{}_{i}}\in\mathbb{R}\). Clearly this function is defined for every real number. For a fixed real number \(c\), we have

\[\lim_{x\to c}p(x)=p(c)\]

By definition, \(p\) is continuous at \(c\). Since \(c\) is any real number, \(p\) is continuous at every real number and hence \(p\) is a continuous function.

**Example 15** Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined by \(f(x)=[x]\), where \([x]\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

**Solution** First observe that \(f\) is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that \(f\) is discontinuous at every integral point. Below we explore, if this is true.

**Fig 5.8**

**Case 1** Let \(c\) be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the graph that for all real numbers _close_ to \(c\) the value of the function is equal to \([c]\); i.e., \(\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim_{x\to c}[x]=[c]\). Also \(f(c)=[c]\) and hence the function is continuous at all real numbers not equal to integers.

**Case 2** Let \(c\) be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number \(r>0\) such that \([c-r]=c-1\) whereas \([c+r]=c\).

This, in terms of limits mean that

\[\cdot\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=c-1,\cdot\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=c\]

Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any \(c\), the function is discontinuous at every integral point.

#### 5.2.1 Algebra of continuous functions

In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions. Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.

**Theorem 1** Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) be two real functions continuous at a real number \(c\). Then

1. \(f+g\) is continuous at \(x=c\).
2. \(f-g\) is continuous at \(x=c\).
3. \(f\cdot g\) is continuous at \(x=c\).
4. \(\cdot\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)\) is continuous at \(x=c\), (provided \(g(c)\neq 0\)).

**Proof** We are investigating continuity of \((f+g)\) at \(x=c\). Clearly it is defined at \(x=c\). We have

\[\lim_{x\to c}(f+g)(x) =\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{x\to c}[f(x)+g(x)]\] (by definition of

\[f+g\]

) \[=\overset{\cdot}{\lim}_{x\to c}f(x)+\lim_{x\to c}g(x)\] (by the theorem on limits) \[=f(c)+g(c)\] (as

\[f\]

 and

\[g\]

 are continuous) \[=\ (f+g)\ (c)\] (by definition of

\[f+g\]

)

Hence, \(f+g\) is continuous at \(x=c\).

Proofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader.

_Remarks_

1. As a special case of (3) above, if \(f\) is a constant function, i.e., \(f(x)=\lambda\) for some real number \(\lambda\), then the function \((\lambda\cdot g)\) defined by \((\lambda\cdot g)\) (\(x\)) = \(\lambda\cdot g(x)\) is also continuous. In particular if \(\lambda=-1\), the continuity of \(f\)implies continuity of \(-f\).
2. As a special case of (4) above, if \(f\) is the constant function \(f(x)=\lambda\), then the function \(\frac{\lambda}{g}\) defined by \(\frac{\lambda}{g}(x)=\frac{\lambda}{g(x)}\) is also continuous wherever \(g(x)\neq 0\). In particular, the continuity of \(g\) implies continuity of \(\frac{1}{g}\).

The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples illustrate this:

**Example 16**: Prove that every rational function is continuous.

**Solution** Recall that every rational function \(f\) is given by

\(f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\), \(q(x)\neq 0\)

where \(p\) and \(q\) are polynomial functions. The domain of \(f\) is all real numbers except points at which \(q\) is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), \(f\)is continuous by (4) of Theorem 1.

**Example 17**: Discuss the continuity of sine function.

**Solution** To see this we use the following facts

\(\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\sin x=0\)

We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of \(\sin x\) near \(0\).

Now, observe that \(f(x)=\sin x\) is defined for every real number. Let \(c\) be a real number. Put \(x=c+h\). If \(x=c\) we know that \(h\to 0\). Therefore

\(\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to c}\sin x\)

\(\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\sin(c+h)\)

\(\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\left[\sin c\cos h+\cos c\sin h\right]\)

\(\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\left[\sin c\cos h\right]+\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\left[\cos c\sin h\right]\)

\(=\sin c+0=\sin c=f(c)\)

Thus \(\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)\) and hence \(f\) is a continuous function.

_Remark_ A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function.

**Example 18**: Prove that the function defined by \(f(x)=\tan x\) is a continuous function.

**Solution**: The function \(f(x)=\tan x=\dfrac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). This is defined for all real numbers such that \(\cos x\neq 0\), i.e., \(x\neq(2n+1)\dfrac{\pi}{2}\). We have just proved that both sine and cosine functions are continuous. Thus \(\tan x\) being a quotient of two continuous functions is continuous wherever it is defined.

An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to composition of functions. Recall that if \(f\) and \(g\) are two real functions, then

\((f\circ g)\)\((x)=f(g(x))\)

is defined whenever the range of \(g\) is a subset of domain of \(f\). The following theorem (stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.

**Theorem 2**: Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are real valued functions such that \((f\circ g)\) is defined at \(c\). If \(g\) is continuous at \(c\) and if \(f\) is continuous at \(g(c)\), then \((f\circ g)\) is continuous at \(c\).

The following examples illustrate this theorem.

**Example 19**: Show that the function defined by \(f(x)=\sin(x^{2})\) is a continuous function.

**Solution**: Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function \(f\) may be thought of as a composition \(g\circ h\) of the two functions \(g\) and \(h\), where \(g(x)=\sin x\) and \(h(x)=x^{2}\). Since both \(g\) and \(h\) are continuous functions, by Theorem 2, it can be deduced that \(f\) is a continuous function.

**Example 20**: Show that the function \(f\) defined by

\(f(x)=|1-x+|x||\),

where \(x\) is any real number, is a continuous function.

**Solution**: Define \(g\) by \(g(x)=1-x+|x|\) and \(h\)_by \(h(x)=|x|\) for all real \(x\). Then

\((h\circ g)\)\((x)=h\left(g(x)\right)\)

\(=h\left(1-x+|x|\right)\)

\(=|1-x+|x||=f(x)\)

In Example 7, we have seen that \(h\) is a continuous function. Hence \(g\) being a sum of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then \(f\) being a composite of two continuous functions is continuous.

### Differentiability

Recall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real function as follows:

Suppose \(f\) is a real function and \(c\) is a point in its domain. The derivative of \(f\) at \(c\) is defined by

\[\cdot\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\]provided this limit exists. Derivative of \(f\) at \(c\) is denoted by \(f^{\prime}(c)\) or \(\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))\left|{}_{c}\right.\). The function defined by

\[\cdot\] \[f^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]

wherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of \(f\). The derivative of \(f\) is denoted by \(f^{\prime}(x)\) or \(\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))\) or if \(y=f(x)\) by \(\dfrac{\cdot}{dx}\) or \(y^{\prime}\). The process of finding derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase _differentiate_\(f(x)\)_with respect to \(x\)_ to mean _find_\(f^{\prime}(x)\).

The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:

1. \((u\pm v)^{\prime}=u^{\prime}\pm v^{\prime}\)
2. \((uv)^{\prime}=u^{\prime}v+uv^{\prime}\) (Leibnitz or product rule) \(\cdot\)
3. \(\left(\dfrac{u}{v}\right)^{\prime}=\dfrac{u^{\prime}v-uv^{\prime}}{v^{2}}\), wherever \(v\neq 0\). (Quotient rule).

The following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:

\[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\par f(x)&x^{n}&\sin x&\cos x&\tan x\\ \hline\par f^{\prime}(x)&nx^{n-1}&\cos x&-\sin x&\sec^{2}x\\ \hline\par\end{array}\]

Whenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution _provided the limit exists_. Now the natural question is; what if it doesn't? The question is quite pertinent and so is its answer. If \(\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\) does not exist, we say that \(f\) is not differentiable at \(c\). In other words, we say that a function \(f\) is differentiable at a point \(c\) in its domain if both \(\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\) and \(\lim_{h\to 0^{\prime}}\dfrac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\) are finite and equal. A function is said to be differentiable in an interval \([a,b]\) if it is differentiable at every point of \([a,b]\). As in case of continuity, at the end points \(a\) and \(b\), we take the right hand limit and left hand limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function at \(a\) and \(b\) respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval \((a,b)\) if it is differentiable at every point of \((a,b)\).

**Theorem 3** If a function \(f\) is differentiable at a point \(c\), then it is also continuous at that point.

**Proof** Since \(f\) is differentiable at \(c\), we have

\[\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}=f^{\prime}(c)\]

But for \(x\neq c\), we have

\[f(x)-f(c) =\frac{\cdot}{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\cdot(x-c)\] \[\cdot\] Therefore \[\lim_{x\to c}\left[f(x)-f(c)\right] =\lim_{x\to c}\left[\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\cdot(x-c)\right]\] \[\cdot\] or \[\cdot\lim_{x\to c}\left[f(x)\right]-\lim_{x\to c}\left[f(c)\right] =\lim_{x\to c}\left[\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\right]\cdot\lim_{x\to c }\left[(x-c)\right]\] \[=f^{\prime}(c)\cdot 0=0\]

or

\[\lim_{x\to c}f(x) =f(c)\]

Hence \(f\) is continuous at \(x=c\).

**Corollary 1** Every differentiable function is continuous.

We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have seen that the function defined by \(f(x)=|x|\) is a continuous function. Consider the left hand limit

\[\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)=f(0)}{h}=\frac{-h}{h}=-1\]

The right hand limit

\[\lim_{h\to 0^{\prime}}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\frac{h}{h}=1\]

Since the above left and right hand limits at \(0\) are not equal, \(\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}\) does not exist and hence \(f\) is not differentiable at \(0\). Thus \(f\) is not a differentiable function.

#### 5.3.1 Derivatives of composite functions

To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say, we want to find the derivative of \(f\), where

\[f(x)=(2x+1)^{3}\]One way is to expand \((2x+1)^{3}\) using binomial theorem and find the derivative as a polynomial function as illustrated below.

\[\begin{split}\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{ dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}}f(x)&=\frac{ \overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}{ dx}\left[(2x+1)^{3}\right]\\ &=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{ dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}{dx}\left(8x^{3}+12x^{2}+6x+1\right)\\ &=24x^{2}+24x+6\\ &=6\ (2x+1)^{2}\\ \end{split}\]

Now, observe that \(f(x)=(h\ \mathrm{o}\ g)\ (x)\)

where \(g(x)=2x+1\) and \(h(x)=x^{3}\). Put \(t=g(x)=2x+1\). Then \(f(x)=h(t)=t^{3}\). Thus

\[\begin{split}\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}&=\ 6\ (2x+1)^{2}=3(2x+1)^{2}. 2=3t^{2}\.\ 2=\frac{dh}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dx}\end{split}\]

The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding the derivative of, say, \((2x+1)^{100}\). We may formalise this observation in the following theorem called the chain rule.

**Theorem 4** (Chain Rule): Let \(f\) be a real valued function which is a composite of two functions \(u\) and \(v\); i.e.,\(f=v\ \mathrm{o}\ \overline{u}\). Suppose \(t=u(x)\) and if both \(\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}\) and \(\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}\) exist, we have

\[\begin{split}\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}&=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}{dt} \cdot\frac{dt}{dx}\end{split}\]

We skip the proof of this theorem, Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose \(f\) is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions \(u\), \(v\) and \(w\); i.e.,

\(f=(w\ \mathrm{o}\ u)\ \mathrm{o}\ v\). If \(t=v(x)\) and \(s=u(t)\), then

\[\begin{split}\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}&=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}{dt} \cdot\frac{dt}{dx}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\underset{dx}{\overset{\cdot}{ \underset{dx}{\rightleftharpoons}}}}}{ds}\cdot\frac{ds}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dx} \end{split}\]

provided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain rule for composite of more functions.

**Example 21**: Find the derivative of the function given by \(f(x)=\sin\ (x^{2})\).

**Solution**: Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if \(t=u(x)=x^{2}\) and \(v(t)=\sin\ t\), then

\[f(x)=(v\ \mathrm{o}\ u)\ (x)=v(u(x))=v(x^{2})=\sin\ x^{2}\]Put \(t=u(x)=x^{2}\). Observe that \(\frac{\cdot}{dt}=\cos t\) and \(\frac{\cdot}{dx}=2x\) exist. Hence, by chain rule

\[\frac{\cdot}{dx}=\frac{\cdot}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dx}=\cos t\cdot 2x\]

It is normal practice to express the final result only in terms of \(x\). Thus

\[\frac{\cdot}{dx}=\cos t\cdot 2x=2x\cos x^{2}\]

Differentiate the functions with respect to \(x\) in Exercises 1 to 8.

1. \(\sin\left(x^{2}+5\right)\) 2. \(\cos\left(\sin x\right)\) 3. \(\sin\left(ax+b\right)\) 4. \(\sec\left(\tan\left(\sqrt{x}\ \right)\right)\) 5. \(\frac{\sin\left(ax+b\right)}{\cos\left(cx+d\right)}\) 6. \(\cos\left(x^{3}\right)\) \(\sin^{2}\left(x^{5}\right)\) 7. \(2\sqrt{\cot\left(x^{2}\right)}\) 8. \(\cos\left(\sqrt{x}\ \right)\) 9. Prove that the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=\left|x\right.\]

is not differentiable at \(x=1\).

10. Prove that the greatest integer function defined by

\[f(x)=\left[x\right]\text{, }0<x<3\]

is not differentiable at \(x=1\) and \(x=2\).

#### 5.3.2 Derivatives of implicit functions

Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form \(y=f(x)\). But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form. For example, consider one of the following relationships between \(x\) and \(y\):

\[x-y-\pi =0\] \[x+\sin xy-y =0\]

In the first case, we can _solve for \(y\)_ and rewrite the relationship as \(y=x-\pi\). In the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to _solve for \(y\)_. Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the dependence of \(y\) on \(x\) in either of the cases. When a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is expressed in a way that it is easy to _solve for \(y\)_ and write \(y=f(x)\), we say that \(y\) is given as an _explicit function_ of \(x\). In the latter case it is implicit that \(y\) is a function of \(x\) and we say that the relationship of the second type, above, gives function _implicitly_. In this subsection, we learn to differentiate implicit functions.

**Example 22**: Find \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\) if \(x-y=\pi\).

**Solution** One way is to solve for \(y\) and rewrite the above as

\[\begin{array}{c}y=x-\pi\\ \cdot\dfrac{dy}{dx}=1\end{array}\]

But then

**Alternatively**, _directly_ differentiating the relationship w.r.t., \(x\), we have

\[\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(x-y\right)=\ \dfrac{d\pi}{dx}\end{array}\]

Recall that \(\dfrac{d\pi}{dx}\) means to differentiate the constant function taking value \(\pi\) everywhere w.r.t., \(x\). Thus

\[\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(x\right)-\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(y\right)=0 \end{array}\]

which implies that

\[\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{d\dot{x}}{dx}=1\end{array}\]

**Example 23**: Find \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\), if \(y+\sin y=\cos x\).

**Solution** We differentiate the relationship directly with respect to \(x\), i.e.,

\[\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{dy}{dx}+\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\sin y\right)=\dfrac{d}{ dx}\left(\cos x\right)\end{array}\]

which implies using chain rule

\[\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{dy}{dx}+\cos y\cdot\dfrac{dy}{dx}=-\sin x\\ \cdot\dfrac{dy}{dx}=-\dfrac{\sin x}{1+\cos y}\end{array}\]

This gives

\[\begin{array}{c}y\neq\left(2n+1\right)\pi\end{array}\]

where

#### 5.3.3 Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions

We remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.

**Example 24**: Find the derivative of \(f\) given by \(f(x)=\sin^{-1}x\) assuming it exists.

**Solution**: Let \(y=\sin^{-1}x\). Then, \(x=\sin y\).

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we get

\[1=\cos y\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{\frac{dy}{dx}}}\]

which implies that

\[\stackrel{{\cdot}}{{\frac{dy}{dx}}}=\frac{1}{\cos y}=\frac{1}{ \cos\left(\sin^{-1}x\right)}\]

Observe that this is defined only for \(\cos y\neq 0\), i.e., \(\sin^{-1}x\neq\frac{\pi}{2}\), i.e., \(x\neq-1\), \(1\), i.e., \(x\in(-1\), \(1)\).

To make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation. Recall that for \(x\in(-1\), \(1)\), \(\sin\left(\sin^{-1}x\right)=x\) and hence

\[\cos^{2}y=1-(\sin y)^{2}=1-(\sin\left(\sin^{-1}x\right))^{2}=1-x^{2}\]

Also, since \(y\in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\), \(\cos y\) is positive and hence \(\cos y=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\)

Thus, for \(x\in(-1\), \(1)\),

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\cos y}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:438]

where \(f_{n}\left(x\right)=x^{n}\). Essentially, this means that the graph of \(y=f_{n}\left(x\right)\)_leans_ more towards the \(y\)-axis as \(n\) increases. For example, consider \(f_{10}(x)=x^{10}\) and \(f_{15}(x)\) = \(x^{15}\). If \(x\) increases from 1 to 2, \(f_{10}\) increases from 1 to \(2^{10}\) whereas \(f_{15}\) increases from 1 to \(2^{15}\). Thus, for the same increment in \(x,f_{15}\) grow faster than \(f_{10}\).

Upshot of the above discussion is that the growth of polynomial functions is dependent on the degree of the polynomial function - higher the degree, greater is the growth. The next natural question is: Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in affirmative and an example of such a function is

\[y\ =f(x)=10^{n}.\]

Our claim is that this function \(f\) grows faster than \(f_{n}(x)=x^{n}\) for any positive integer \(n\). For example, we can prove that \(10^{n}\) grows faster than \(f_{100}(x)=x^{100}\). For large values of \(x\) like \(x=10^{3}\), note that \(f_{100}(x)=(10^{3})^{100}=10^{300}\) whereas \(f(10^{3})=10^{10^{3}}=10^{1000}\). Clearly \(f(x)\) is much greater than \(f_{100}\left(x\right)\). It is not difficult to prove that for all \(x>10^{3},f(x)>f_{100}\left(x\right)\). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly, by choosing large values of \(x\), one can verify that \(f(x)\) grows faster than \(f_{n}\left(x\right)\) for any positive integer \(n\).

**Definition 3** The exponential function with positive base \(b>1\) is the function

\[y=f(x)=b^{x}\]

The graph of \(y=10^{x}\) is given in the Fig 5.9.

It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of \(b\) like 2, 3 and 4. Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:

1. Domain of the exponential function is \(\mathbf{R}\), the set of all real numbers.
2. Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
3. The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a restatement of the fact that \(b^{0}=1\) for any real \(b>1\)).
4. Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the graph rises above.

5. For very large negative values of \(x\), the exponential function is very close to 0. In other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches \(x\)-axis (but never meets it).

Exponential function with base 10 is called the _common exponential function_. In the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series

\[\cdot\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1!}}+\frac{1}{2!}+...\]

is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by \(e\). Using this \(e\) as the base we obtain an extremely important exponential function \(y=e^{x}\).

This is called _natural exponential function_.

It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and has _nice_ interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.

**Definition 4**: Let \(b>1\) be a real number. Then we say logarithm of \(a\) to base \(b\) is \(x\) if \(b^{x}=a\).

Logarithm of \(a\) to base \(b\) is denoted by \(\log_{b}a\). Thus \(\log_{b}a=x\) if \(b^{x}=a\). Let us work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know \(2^{3}=8\). In terms of logarithms, we may rewrite this as \(\log_{2}8=3\). Similarly, \(10^{4}=10000\) is equivalent to saying \(\log_{10}10000=4\). Also, \(625=5^{4}=25^{2}\) is equivalent to saying \(\log_{5}625=4\) or \(\log_{25}625=2\).

On a slightly more mature note, fixing a base \(b>1\), we may look at logarithm as a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the _logarithmic function_, is defined by

\[\begin{array}{c}\log_{b}\cdot\mathbf{R}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\\ x\rightarrow\ \log_{b}x=y\end{array}\text{ if }b^{y}=x\]

As before if the base \(b=10\), we say it is _common logarithms_ and if \(b=e\), then we say it is _natural logarithms_. Often natural logarithm is denoted by \(ln\). _In this chapter_, \(log\ x\)_denotes the logarithm function to base \(e\)_, i.e., \(ln\ x\) will be written as simply \(\log x\). The Fig 5.10 gives the plots of logarithm function to base \(2\), \(e\) and \(10\).

Some of the important observations about the logarithm function to any base \(b>1\) are listed below:1. We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers and hence the domain of log function is \(\mathbf{R}^{+}\).
2. The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.
3. The point \((1,0)\) is always on the graph of the log function.
4. The log function is ever increasing, i.e., as we move from left to right the graph rises above.
5. For \(x\) very near to zero, the value of log \(x\) can be made lesser than any given real number. In other words in the fourth quadrant the graph approaches \(y\)-axis (but never meets it).
6. Fig 5.11 gives the plot of \(y=e^{x}\) and \(y=ln\ x\). It is of interest to observe that the two curves are the mirror images of each other reflected in the line \(y=x\).

Two properties of 'log' functions are proved below:

1. There is a standard change of base rule to obtain \(\log_{a}p\) in terms of \(\log_{b}p\). Let \(\log_{a}p=\alpha\), \(\log_{b}p=\beta\) and \(\log_{b}a=\gamma\). This means \(a^{\alpha}=p\), \(b^{\beta}=p\) and \(b^{\beta}=a\). Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have \((b^{\gamma})^{\alpha}=b^{\beta\alpha}=p\) Using this in the second equation, we get \(b^{\beta}=p=b^{\gamma\alpha}\) which implies \(\beta=\alpha\gamma\) or \(\alpha=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\). But then \(\log_{a}p=\frac{\log_{b}p}{\log_{b}a}\)
2. Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let \(\log_{b}pq=\alpha\). Then \(b^{\alpha}=pq\). If \(\log_{b}p=\beta\) and \(\log_{b}q=\gamma\), then \(b^{\beta}=p\) and \(b^{\gamma}=q\). But then \(b^{\alpha}=pq=b^{\beta}b^{\gamma}=b^{\beta\ +\ \gamma}\) which implies \(\alpha=\beta+\gamma\), i.e., \[\log_{b}pq=\log_{b}p\ +\log_{b}q\]A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when \(p=q\). In this case the above may be rewritten as

\[\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,p^{2}=\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,p+\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,p=2 \,\log\,p\]

An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is

\[\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,p^{n}=n\,\log\,p\]

for any positive integer \(n\). In fact this is true for any real number \(n\), but we will not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify

\[\log_{\mathbf{s}}\,\frac{x}{y}=\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,x-\log_{\mathbf{s}_{b}}\,y\]

**Example 25**: Is it true that \(x=e^{\log x}\) for all real \(x\)?

SolutionFirst, observe that the domain of \(\log\) function is set of all positive real numbers. So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let \(y=e^{\log x}\). If \(y>0\), we may take logarithm which gives us \(\log y=\log\,(e^{\log x})=\log x\), \(\log e=\log x\). Thus \(y=x\). Hence \(x=e^{\log x}\) is true only for positive values of \(x\).

One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential calculus is that it doesn't change during the process of differentiation. This is captured in the following theorem whose proof we skip

**Theorem 5***

1. The derivative of \(e^{x}\) w.r.t., \(x\) is \(e^{x}\), i.e., \(\frac{d}{dx}\,(e^{x})=e^{x}\).
2. The derivative of \(\log x\) w.r.t., \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\), i.e., \(\frac{d}{dx}\,(\log x)=\frac{1}{x}\).

**Example 26**: Differentiate the following w.r.t. \(x\):

1. \(e^{-x}\) (ii) \(\sin\,(\log x),x>0\) (iii) \(\cos^{-1}\,(e^{x})\) (iv) \(e^{\cos x}\)

Solution
1. Let \(y=e^{-x}\). Using chain rule, we have \[\frac{dy}{dx}=e^{-x}\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\,\,(-x)=-\,e^{-x}\]
2. Let \(y=\sin\,(\log x)\). Using chain rule, we have \[\frac{dy}{dx}=\cos\,(\log x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\,(\log x)=\frac{\cos\,(\log x)}{x}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:443]

**Example 27**: Differentiate \(\sqrt{\frac{\left(x-3\right)\left(x^{2}+4\right)}{3x^{2}+4x+5}}\) w.r.t. \(x\).

**Solution**: Let \(y=\sqrt{\frac{\left(x-3\right)\left(x^{2}+4\right)}{\left(3x^{2}+4x+5\right)}}\)

Taking logarithm on both sides, we have

\[\log y=\frac{1}{2}\left[\log\left(x-3\right)+\log\left(x^{2}+4\right)-\log \left(3x^{2}+4x+5\right)\right]\]

Now, differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we get

\[\frac{\cdot}{y}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} =\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{\left(x-3\right)}+\frac{2x}{x^{2}+4}- \frac{6x+4}{3x^{2}+4x+5}\right]\] \[\cdot\]

or

\[\frac{dy}{dx} =\frac{y}{2}\left[\frac{1}{\left(x-3\right)}+\frac{2x}{x^{2}+4}- \frac{6x+4}{3x^{2}+4x+5}\right]\] \[\cdot\]

**Example 28**: Differentiate \(a^{x}\) w.r.t. \(x\), where \(\bar{a}\) is a positive constant.

**Solution**: Let \(y=a^{x}\). Then

\[\log y=x\log a\]

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we have

\[\frac{1}{y}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} =\log a\]

or

\[\frac{dy}{dx} =y\log a\]

Thus

\[\frac{d}{dx}(a^{x}) =a^{x}\log a\] \[\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(a^{x}) =\frac{d}{dx}(e^{x\log a})=e^{x\log a}\frac{d}{dx}(x\log a)\] \[=e^{x\log a}\cdot\log a=a^{x}\log a.\]

**Example 29**: Differentiate \(x^{\sin x}\), \(x>0\) w.r.t. \(x\).

**Solution** Let \(y=x^{\sin x}\). Taking logarithm on both sides, we have

\[\log y =\sin x\log x\] Therefore \[\frac{1}{y}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} =\sin x\frac{d}{dx}\left(\log x\right)+\log x\frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin x\right)\] \[\cdot\] or \[\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} =\left(\sin x\right)\frac{1}{x}+\log x\cos x\] \[\cdot\] or \[\frac{dy}{dx} =y\bigg{[}\frac{\sin x}{x}+\cos x\log x\bigg{]}\] \[\cdot\] \[=x^{\sin x}\bigg{[}\frac{\sin x}{x}+\cos x\log x\bigg{]}\] \[=x^{\sin x-1}\cdot\sin x+x^{\sin x}\cdot\cos x\log x\] \[\cdot\]

**Example 30**: Find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), if \(y^{x}+x^{y}+\sqrt[x]{x^{x}}=a^{b}\).

**Solution** Given that \(y^{x}+x^{y}+\sqrt[x]{x^{x}}=a^{b}\).

Putting \(u=y^{x}\), \(v=x^{y}\) and \(w=x^{x}\), we get \(u+v+w=a^{b}\)

\[\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dx}+\frac{dw}{dx}=0\]... (1)

Now, \(u=y^{x}\). Taking logarithm on both sides, we have

\[\log u=x\log y\]

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we have

\[\frac{1}{u}\cdot\frac{du}{dx} =x\frac{d}{dx}(\log y)+\log y\frac{d}{dx}(x)\] \[\cdot\] \[=x\frac{1}{y}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}+\log y\cdot 1\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] So \[\frac{du}{dx} =u\bigg{(}\frac{x}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}+\log y\bigg{)}=y^{x}\bigg{[} \frac{x}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}+\log y\bigg{]}\quad... \tag{2}\]

Also \(v=x^{y}\)Taking logarithm on both sides, we have

\[\log v=y\,\log x\]

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we have

\[\frac{1}{v}\cdot\frac{dv}{dx} = y\frac{d}{dx}(\log x)+\log x\frac{dy}{dx}\] \[\cdot\] \[= y\cdot\frac{1}{x}+\log x\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[= x^{y}\Bigg{[}\frac{y}{x}+\log x\frac{dy}{dx}\Bigg{]}\]

Again \(w=x^{x}\)

Taking logarithm on both sides, we have

\[\log w=x\log x.\]

Differentiating both sides w.r.t. \(x\), we have

\[\frac{1}{w}\cdot\frac{dw}{dx} = x\frac{d}{dx}(\log x)+\log x\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(x)\] \[\cdot\] \[= x\cdot\frac{1}{x}+\log x\cdot 1\]

i.e.

\[\frac{dw}{dx} = w\,(1+\log x) \tag{4}\]

From (1), (2), (3), (4), we have

\[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\]

or

\[(x\cdot y^{x-1}+x^{y}\cdot\log x)\,\,\frac{dy}{dx} = -x^{x}\,(1\,+\log x)-y\cdot x^{y-1}-y^{x}\,\log y\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\]

Therefore

\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-[y^{x}\log y+y\cdot x^{y-1}+x^{x}(1+\log x)]}{x\cdot y^{x- 1}+x^{y}\,\log x}\]Differentiate the functions given in Exercises 1 to 11 w.r.t. \(x\).

### Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms

Sometimes the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately, establishes a relation between the first two variables. In such a situation, we say that the relation between 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:448]

**Example 33**: Find \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\), if \(x=a\ (\theta+\sin\ \theta)\), \(y=a\ (1-\cos\ \theta)\).

**Solution**: We have \(\dfrac{dx}{d\theta}=a(1+\cos\ \theta)\), \(\dfrac{dy}{d\theta}=a\ (\sin\ \theta)\)

Therefore \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{d\theta}}{\dfrac{dx}{d\theta}}= \dfrac{a\sin\theta}{a(1+\cos\theta)}=\tan\dfrac{\theta}{2}\)

Note It may be noted here that \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\) is expressed in terms of parameter only without directly involving the main variables \(x\) and \(y\).

**Example 34**: Find \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\), if \(x^{\frac{2}{3}}+y^{\frac{2}{3}}=a^{\frac{2}{3}}\)

**Solution**: Let \(x=a\ \cos^{3}\theta\), \(y=a\sin^{3}\theta\). Then

Hence, \(x=a\ \cos^{3}\theta\), \(y=a\ \sin^{3}\theta\) is parametric equation of \(x^{\frac{2}{3}}+y^{\frac{2}{3}}=a^{\frac{2}{3}}\)

Now

\(\dfrac{dx}{d\theta}=-3a\ \cos^{2}\theta\ \sin\ \theta\) and \(\dfrac{dy}{d\theta}=3a\ \sin^{2}\theta\ \cos\ \theta\)

Therefore

\(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{d\theta}}{\dfrac{dx}{d\theta}}= \dfrac{3a\sin^{2}\theta\cos\theta}{-3a\cos^{2}\theta\sin\theta}=-\tan\theta=- 3\dfrac{y}{x}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:450]

**Example 35**: Find \(\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}\), if \(y=x^{3}+\tan x\).
**Solution**: Given that \(y=x^{3}+\tan x\). Then

\[\dfrac{dy}{dx} =3x^{2}+\sec^{2}x\] \[\cdot\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} =\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(3x^{2}+\sec^{2}x\right)\] \[=6x+2\sec x\.\sec x\tan x=6x+2\sec^{2}x\tan x\]

**Example 36**: If \(y=\mathrm{A}\,\sin x+\mathrm{B}\,\cos x\), then prove that \(\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}+y=0\).
**Solution**: We have

\[\dfrac{dy}{dx} =\mathrm{A}\,\cos x-\mathrm{B}\,\sin x\] \[\cdot\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} =\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\mathrm{A}\,\cos x-\mathrm{B}\,\sin x\right)\] \[\cdot\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} =-\mathrm{A}\,\sin x-\mathrm{B}\,\cos x=-y\]

Hence

**Example 37**: If \(y=3e^{2x}+2e^{3x}\), prove that \(\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}-5\dfrac{dy}{dx}+6y=0\).
**Solution**: Given that \(y=3e^{2x}+2e^{3x}\). Then

\[\dfrac{dy}{dx} =6e^{2x}+6e^{3x}=6\ (e^{2x}+e^{3x})\] \[\cdot\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} =12e^{2x}+18e^{3x}=6\ (2e^{2x}+3e^{3x})\] \[\cdot\dfrac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} =6\ (2e^{2x}+3e^{3x})\] \[-30\ (e^{2x}+e^{3x})+6\ (3e^{2x}+2e^{3x})=0\]

2. Let \(y=\log_{7}\left(\log x\right)=\frac{\cdot}{\log\left(\log x\right)}\) (by change of base formula). The function is defined for all real numbers \(x>1\). Therefore \[\frac{dy}{dx} =\frac{1}{\log 7}\frac{d}{dx}(\log\left(\log x\right))\] \[=\frac{1}{\log 7}\frac{1}{\log x}\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(\log x)\] \[=\frac{1}{x\log 7\,\log x}\]

**Example 40**: Differentiate the following w.r.t. \(x\).

1. \(\cos^{-1}\left(\sin x\right)\) (ii) \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin x}{1+\cos x}\right)\) (iii) \(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{2^{x+1^{\prime}}}{1+4^{x}}\right)\)

**Solution**

1. Let \(f(x)=\cos^{-1}\left(\sin x\right)\). Observe that this function is defined for all real numbers. We may rewrite this function as \[f(x) =\cos^{-1}\left(\sin x\right)\] \[=\cos^{-1}\left[\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}x\right)\right]\] Thus \[f^{\prime}(x) =-1.\]
2. Let \(f(x)=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin x}{1+\cos x}\right)\). Observe that this function is defined for all real numbers, where \(\cos x\neq-1\); i.e., at all odd multiplies of \(\pi\). We may rewrite this function as \[f(x) =\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin x}{1+\cos x}\right)\] \[=\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{2\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos\left( \frac{x}{2}\right)}{2\cos^{2}\frac{x}{2}}\right]\]\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ =\tan^{-1}\left[\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right]=\frac{x}{2}\\ \cdot\\ \end{array}\]

Observe that we could cancel \(\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\)in both numerator and denominator as it is not equal to zero. Thus \(f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\).
3. Let \(f(x)=\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{2^{x\,+\,1}}{1+4^{x}}\right)\). To find the domain of this function we need to find all \(x\) such that \(-1\leq\frac{2^{x+1}}{1+4^{x}}\leq 1\). Since the quantity in the middle is always positive, we need to find all \(x\) such that \(\frac{2^{x+1}}{1+4^{x}}\leq 1\), i.e., all \(x\) such that \(2^{x+1}\leq 1+4^{x}\). We may rewrite this as \(2\leq\frac{1}{2^{x}}\,+\,2^{x}\) which is true for all \(x\). Hence the function is defined at every real number. By putting \(2^{x}=\tan 0\), this function may be rewritten as

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ =\sin^{-1}\left[\frac{2^{x\,+\,1}}{1+4^{x}}\right]\\ \cdot\\ =\sin^{-1}\left[\frac{2\tan 0}{1+\tan^{2}0}\right]\\ \cdot\\ =\sin^{-1}\left[\sin 20\right]\\ \cdot\\ \end{array}\]

Thus \(f^{\prime}(x)=2\cdot\frac{1}{1+\left(2^{x}\right)^{2}}\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\,(2^{x})\)

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ =\frac{2}{1+4^{x}}\cdot(2^{x})\log 2\\ \cdot\\ =\frac{2^{x\,+\,1}\log 2}{1+4^{x}}\end{array}\]

**Example 41**: Find \(f^{\prime}(x)\) if \(f(x)=(\sin x)^{\sin x}\) for all \(0<x<\pi\).

**Solution** The function \(y=(\sin x)^{\sin x}\) is defined for all positive real numbers. Taking logarithms, we have

\[\log y =\log\,(\sin x)^{\sin x}=\sin x\,\log\,(\sin x)\] \[\cdot\,\frac{1}{y}\,\frac{dy}{dx} =\frac{d}{dx}\,\left(\sin x\log\,(\sin x)\right)\] \[=\cos x\,\log\,(\sin x)+\sin x\,\cdot\,\frac{1}{\sin x}\,\cdot\, \frac{d}{dx}\,(\sin x)\] \[=\cos x\,\log\,(\sin x)+\cos x\] \[=(1+\log\,(\sin x))\cos x\]

Thus

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=y((1+\log\,(\sin x))\,\cos x)=(1+\log\,(\sin x))\,(\sin x)^{\sin x }\cos x\]

**Example 42**: For a positive constant \(a\) find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), where

\[y=a^{\frac{t+1}{t}},\,\,\text{and}\,\,x=\left(t+\frac{1}{t}\right)^{a}\]

**Solution** Observe that both \(y\) and \(x\) are defined for all real \(t\neq 0\). Clearly

\[\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(t+\frac{1}{t}\right)=a^{t+\frac{1}{t}}\,\frac {d}{dt}\left(t+\frac{1}{t}\right)\cdot\log a\]

\[\cdot\,\frac{dy}{dt}=a^{t+\frac{1}{t}}\left(1-\frac{1}{t^{2}}\right)\log a\]

Similarly

\[\frac{dx}{dt}=a\left[t+\frac{1}{t}\right]^{a-1}\cdot\frac{d}{dt}\left(t+ \frac{1}{t}\right)\]

\[\cdot\,\frac{dx}{dt}\neq 0\,\,\text{only if }t\neq\pm 1.\,\text{Thus for }t\neq\pm 1,\]

### Summary

* A real valued function is _continuous_ at a point in its domain if the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function at that point. A function is continuous if it is continuous on the whole of its domain.
* Sum, difference, product and quotient of continuous functions are continuous. i.e., if \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous functions, then \((f\pm g)\)\((x)=f(x)\pm g(x)\) is continuous. \((f\cdot g)\)\((x)=f(x)\cdot g(x)\) is continuous. \(\cdot\)\(\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)\)\((x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) (wherever \(g(x)\neq 0\)) is continuous.
* Every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true.
* Chain rule is rule to differentiate composites of functions. If \(=v\) o \(u\), \(t=u\)\((x)\) and if both \(\dfrac{dt}{dx}\) and \(\dfrac{dv}{dt}\) exist then \(\dfrac{df}{dx}=\dfrac{dv}{dt}\cdot\dfrac{dt}{dx}\)
* Following are some of the standard derivatives (in appropriate domains): \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\big{(}\sin^{1}x\big{)}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\) \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\big{(}\cos^{-1}x\big{)}=-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\) \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\big{(}\tan^{-1}x\big{)}=\dfrac{1}{1+x^{2}}\) \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\big{(}e^{x}\big{)}=e^{x}\) \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\big{(}\log x\big{)}=\dfrac{1}{x}\)
* Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique to differentiate functions of the form \(f(x)=[u\ (x)]^{v}\). Here both \(f(x)\) and \(u(x)\) need to be positive for this technique to make sense.

## Application of Derivatives

With the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature." -- WHITEHEAD

### Introduction

In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions. In this chapter, we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in engineering, science, social science, and many other fields. For instance, we will learn how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or smallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally, we use the derivative to find approximate value of certain quantities.

### Rate of Change of Quantities

Recall that by the derivative \(\frac{ds}{dt}\), we mean the rate of change of distance \(s\) with respect to the time \(t\). In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity \(y\) varies with another quantity \(x\), satisfying some rule \(y=f(x)\), then \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (or \(f^{\prime}(x)\)) represents the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) and \(\frac{dy}{dx}\bigg{]}_{x=x_{0}}\) (or \(f^{\prime}(x_{0})\)) represents the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) at \(x=x_{0}\).

Further, if two variables \(x\) and \(y\) are varying with respect to another variable \(t\), i.e., if \(x=f(t)\) and \(y=g(t)\), then by Chain Rule

\[\frac{\overset{\cdot}{dy}}{dx}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{dy}}{dt}\bigg{/}\frac{ dx}{dt}\,,\,\,\,\text{if}\,\,\,\frac{\overset{\cdot}{dx}}{dt}\neq 0\]Thus, the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) can be calculated using the rate of change of \(y\) and that of \(x\) both with respect to \(t\).

Let us consider some examples.

**Example 1**: Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to its radius \(r\) when \(r=5\) cm.

**Solution** The area A of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by A = \(\pi r^{2}\). Therefore, the rate of change of the area A with respect to its radius \(r\) is given by \(\dot{\frac{dA}{dr}}\) = \(\frac{d}{dr}(\pi r^{2})\) = \(2\pi r\).

When \(r=5\) cm, \(\dot{\frac{dA}{dr}}\) = \(10\pi\). Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of \(10\pi\) cm\({}^{2}\)/s.

**Example 2**: The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per second. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10 centimetres?

**Solution** Let \(x\) be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of the cube. Then, V = \(x^{3}\) and S = \(6x^{2}\), where \(x\) is a function of time \(t\).

Now

\[\dot{\frac{d\textbf{V}}{dt}}=9\text{cm}^{3}\text{/s}\left(\text{Given}\right)\]

Therefore

\[\dot{\frac{d\textbf{V}}{dt}}=\frac{d}{dt}(x^{3})=\frac{d}{dx}(x^{3})\cdot \frac{dx}{dt}\] (By Chain Rule)

\[\dot{\frac{d\textbf{V}}{dt}}=3x^{2}\cdot\frac{dx}{dt}\]

or

\[\dot{\frac{d\textbf{V}}{dt}}=\frac{d}{dt}(6x^{2})=\frac{d}{dx}(6x^{2})\cdot \frac{dx}{dt}\] (By Chain Rule)

\[\dot{\frac{d\textbf{V}}{dt}}=12x\cdot\left(\frac{3}{x^{2}}\right)=\frac{36}{x}\] (Using (1))

Hence, when

\[x=10\text{ cm},\ \frac{dS}{dt}=3.6\text{ cm}^{2}\text{/s}\]

**Example 5** The total cost \(\mathrm{C}(x)\) in Rupees, associated with the production of \(x\) units of an item is given by

\[\mathrm{C}\left(x\right)=0.005\ x^{3}-0.02\ x^{2}+30x+5000\]

Find the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output.

SolutionSince marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the output, we have

\[\mathrm{Marginal}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\mathrm{cost}\ (\mathrm{MC}) =\frac{\overset{\cdot}{dC}}{dx}=0.005(3x^{2})-0.02(2x)+30\]

When

\[x=3\]

, \[\mathrm{MC} =0.015(3^{2})-0.04(3)+30\]

\[=0.135-0.12+30=30.015\]

Hence, the required marginal cost is \(\mathfrak{F}\,30.02\) (nearly).

**Example 6** The total revenue in Rupees received from the sale of \(x\) units of a product is given by \(\mathrm{R}(x)=3x^{2}+36x+5\). Find the marginal revenue, when \(x=5\), where by marginal revenue we mean the rate of change of total revenue with respect to the number of items sold at an instant.

SolutionSince marginal revenue is the rate of change of total revenue with respect to the number of units sold, we have

\[\mathrm{Marginal}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\mathrm{Marginal}\ \mathrm{Revenue}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\mathrm{(MR)}=\frac{d \mathrm{R}}{dx}=6x+36\]

When

\[x=5\]

, \[\mathrm{MR}=6(5)+36=66\]

Hence, the required marginal revenue is \(\mathfrak{F}\,66\).

### Increasing and Decreasing Functions

In this section, we will use differentiation to find out whether a function is increasing or decreasing or none.

Consider the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=x^{2},x\in\mathbf{R}\). The graph of this function is a parabola as given in Fig 6.1.

Values left to origin

5. strictly decreasing on I if \(x_{{}_{1}}<x_{{}_{2}}\) in I \(\Rightarrow f(x_{{}_{1}})>f(x_{{}_{2}})\) for all \(x_{{}_{1}}\), \(x_{{}_{2}}\in\) I.

For graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2.

**Fig 6.2**

We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point.

**Definition 2** Let \(x_{{}_{0}}\) be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function \(f\). Then \(f\) is said to be increasing, decreasing at \(x_{{}_{0}}\) if there exists an open interval I containing \(x_{{}_{0}}\) such that \(f\) is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I.

Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function.

**Example 7** Show that the function given by \(f(x)=7x-3\) is increasing on \(\mathbf{R}\).

**Solution** Let \(x_{{}_{1}}\) and \(x_{{}_{2}}\) be any two numbers in \(\mathbf{R}\). Then

\[x_{{}_{1}}<x_{{}_{2}}\Rightarrow 7x_{{}_{1}}<7x_{{}_{2}}\Rightarrow 7x_{{}_{1}}-3<7x_{{}_{2}}-3 \Rightarrow f(x_{{}_{1}})<f(x_{{}_{2}})\]

Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that \(f\) is strictly increasing on \(\mathbf{R}\).

We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions.

The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5.

**Theorem 1** Let \(f\) be continuous on \([a\), \(b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \((a\),\(b)\). Then

1. \(f\) is increasing in \([a\),\(b]\) if \(f^{\prime}(x)\geq 0\) for each \(x\in(a\), \(b)\)
2. \(f\) is decreasing in \([a\),\(b]\) if \(f^{\prime}(x)\leq 0\) for each \(x\in(a\), \(b)\)
3. \(f\) is a constant function in \([a\),\(b]\) if \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) for each \(x\in(a\), \(b)\)

**Proof** (a) Let \(x_{{}_{1}}\), \(x_{{}_{2}}\in[a\), \(b]\) be such that \(x_{{}_{1}}<x_{{}_{2}}\).

Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point \(c\) between \(x_{{}_{1}}\) and \(x_{{}_{2}}\) such that

\[f(x_{{}_{2}})\ -f(x_{{}_{1}})=f^{\prime}(c)\ (x_{{}_{2}}-x_{{}_{1}})\]

i.e. \[f(x_{{}_{2}})\ -f(x_{{}_{1}})>0\qquad\qquad\qquad(\text{as}\,f^{\prime}(c)>0 \ (\text{given}))\]

i.e. \[f(x_{{}_{2}})>f(x_{{}_{1}})\]

Thus, we have

\[x_{{}_{1}}<x_{{}_{2}}\Rightarrow f(x_{{}_{1}})<f(x_{{}_{2}}),\ \text{ for all }x_{{}_{1}},x_{{}_{2}}\in[a,b]\]

Hence, \(f\) is an increasing function in \([a,b]\).

The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader.

_Remarks_

There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if \(f(x)>0\) for \(x\) in an interval excluding the end points and \(f\)is continuous in the interval, then \(f\) is increasing. Similarly, if \(f(x)<0\) for \(x\) in an interval excluding the end points and \(f\) is continuous in the interval, then \(f\) is decreasing.

**Example 8** Show that the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=x^{3}=3x^{2}+4x,\ x\in\mathbf{R}\]

is increasing on \(\mathbf{R}\).

**Solution** Note that

\[f^{\prime}(x) =3x^{2}-6x+4\] \[=3(x^{2}-2x+1)+1\] \[=3(x-1)^{2}+1>0,\text{ in every interval of }\mathbf{R}\]

Therefore, the function \(f\) is increasing on \(\mathbf{R}\).

**Example 9** Prove that the function given by \(f(x)=\cos x\) is

1. decreasing in \((0,\pi)\)
2. increasing in \((\pi,2\pi)\), and
3. neither increasing nor decreasing in \((0,2\pi)\).

**Solution**: Note that \(f^{\prime}(x)=-\)\(\sin\,x\)

* Since for each \(x\in(0,\,\pi)\), \(\sin\,x>0\), we have \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) and so \(f\) is decreasing in \((0,\,\pi)\).
* Since for each \(x\in(\pi,\,2\pi)\), \(\sin\,x<0\), we have \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) and so \(f\) is increasing in \((\pi,\,2\pi)\).
* Clearly by (a) and (b) above, \(f\) is neither increasing nor decreasing in \((0,\,2\pi)\).

**Example 10**: Find the intervals in which the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=x^{2}-4x\pm 6\) is

* increasing (b) decreasing

**Solution**: We have

\[f(x) = x^{2}-4x+6\] or \[f^{\prime}(x) = 2x-4\]

**Fig 6.3**:

Therefore, \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=2\). Now the point \(x=2\) divides the real line into two disjoint intervals namely, \((-\infty,2)\) and \((2,\infty)\) (Fig 6.3). In the interval \((-\infty,2),f^{\prime}(x)=2x\) - \(4<0\).

Therefore, \(f\) is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval \((2,\infty)\), \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) and so the function \(f\) is increasing in this interval.

**Example 11**: Find the intervals in which the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=4x^{3}-6x^{2}-72x\) + \(30\) is (a) increasing (b) decreasing.

**Solution**: We have

\[f(x) = 4x^{3}-6x^{2}-72x+30\] or \[f^{\prime}(x) = 12x^{2}-12x-72\] \[= 12(x^{2}-x-6)\] \[= 12(x-3)\ (x+2)\]

Therefore, \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=-\)\(2,\,3\). The points \(x=-\)\(2\) and \(x=3\) divides the real line into three disjoint intervals, namely, \((-\infty,-2),(-2,3)\) and \((3,\infty)\).

In the intervals \((-\infty,-2)\) and \((3,\infty),f^{\prime}(x)\) is positive while in the interval \((-2,3)\), \(f^{\prime}(x)\) is negative. Consequently, the function \(f\) is increasing in the intervals \((-\infty,-2)\) and \((3,\infty)\) while the function is decreasing in the interval \((-2,3)\). However, \(f\) is neither increasing nor decreasing in \(\mathbf{R}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Interval & Sign of \(f^{\prime}(x)\) & Nature of function \(f\) \\ \hline \((-\infty,-2)\) & \((-)\)\((-)>0\) & \(f\) is increasing \\ \hline \((-2,3)\) & \((-)\)\((+)<0\) & \(f\) is decreasing \\ \hline \((3,\infty)\) & \((+)\)\((+)>0\) & \(f\) is increasing \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 12** Find intervals in which the function given by \(f(x)=\sin 3x_{y}\), \(x\in\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\) is (a) increasing (b) decreasing.

**Solution** We have

or

Therefore, \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(\cos 3x=0\) which in turn gives \(3x=\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\) (as \(x\in\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\) ) implies \(3x\in\left[0,\frac{3\pi}{2}\right]\). So \(x=\frac{\pi}{6}\) and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). The point \(x=\frac{\pi}{6}\) divides the interval \(\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\) into two disjoint intervals \(\left[0,\frac{\pi}{6}\right]\) and \(\left(\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\cdot\) & \(\cdot\) \\ \hline \(\cdot\) & \(\cdot\) \\ \hline \(\cdot\) & \(\cdot\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Now, \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) for all \(x\in\left[0,\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\) as \(0\leq x<\frac{\pi}{6}\Rightarrow 0\leq 3x<\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) for all \(x\in\left(\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\) as \(\frac{\pi}{6}<x<\frac{\pi}{2}\Rightarrow\frac{\pi}{2}<3x<\frac{3\pi}{2}\).

Therefore, \(f\) is increasing in \(\left[0,\frac{\pi}{6}\right]\) and decreasing in \(\left(\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{\Also, the given function is continuous at \(x=0\) and \(x=\dfrac{\pi}{6}\). Therefore, by Theorem 1, \(f\)is increasing on \(\left[0,\dfrac{\pi}{6}\right]\) and decreasing on \(\left[\dfrac{\pi}{6},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right]\).

**Example 13**: Find the intervals in which the function \(f\)given by

\(f(x)=\sin x+\cos x\), \(0\leq x\leq 2\pi\)

is increasing or decreasing.

**Solution** We have

\(f(x)=\sin x+\cos x\),

or

\(f^{\prime}(x)=\cos x-\sin x\)

Now \(\overset{\cdot}{f^{\prime}}(x)=0\) gives \(\sin x=\cos x\) which gives that \(x=\dfrac{\pi}{4}\), \(\dfrac{5\pi}{4}\) as \(0\leq x\leq 2\pi\)

The points \(x=\dfrac{\pi}{4}\) and \(x=\dfrac{5\pi}{4}\) divide the interval \([0,2\pi]\) into three disjoint intervals, namely, \(\left[0,\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right]\), \(\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4},\dfrac{5\pi}{4}\right)\) and \(\left(\dfrac{5\pi}{4},2\pi\right]\).

Note that \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) if \(x\in\left[0,\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right]\cup\left(\dfrac{5\pi}{4},2\pi\right]\)

or

\(f\)is increasing in the intervals \(\left[0,\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right]\) and \(\left(\dfrac{5\pi}{4},2\pi\right]\)

Also

\(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) if \(x\in\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4},\dfrac{5\pi}{4}\right)\)

or

\(f\) is decreasing in \(\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4},\dfrac{5\pi}{4}\right)\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Interval & Sign of \(f^{\prime}(x)\) & Nature of function \\ \hline \(\left[\,0,\frac{\pi}{4}\,\right]\) & \(>0\) & \(f\) is increasing \\ \hline \(\left(\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{5\pi}{4}\,\right)\) & \(<0\) & \(f\) is decreasing \\ \hline \(\left(\frac{5\pi}{4},2\pi\,\right]\) & \(>0\) & \(f\) is increasing \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Maxima and Minima

In this section, we will use the concept of derivatives to calculate the maximum or minimum values of various functions. In fact, we will find the 'turning points' of the graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (orlowest) _locally_. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of a given function. Further, we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems.

Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life.

1. The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by \(\mathrm{P}(x)=ax+bx^{2}\), where \(a\),\(b\) are constants and \(x\) is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per acre will maximise the profit?
2. A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path given by \(h(x)=60+x-\dfrac{x^{2}}{60}\), where \(x\) is the horizontal distance from the building and \(h(x)\) is the height of the ball. What is the maximum height the ball will reach?
3. An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve \(f(x)=x^{2}+7\). A soldier, placed at the point (\(1\), \(2\)), wants to shoot the helicopter when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance?

In each of the above problem, there is something common, i, e., we wish to find out the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems, we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local maxima and minima and test for determining such points.

**Definition 3**: Let \(f\) be a function defined on an interval \(\mathrm{I}\). Then

1. \(f\) is said to have a _maximum value_ in \(\mathrm{I}\), if there exists a point \(c\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) such that \(f(c)>f(x)\), for all \(x\in\mathrm{I}\). The number \(f(c)\) is called the maximum value of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) and the point \(c\) is called a _point of maximum value_ of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\).
2. \(f\) is said to have a minimum value in \(\mathrm{I}\), if there exists a point \(c\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) such that \(f(c)<f(x)\), for all \(x\in\mathrm{I}\). The number \(f(c)\), in this case, is called the minimum value of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) and the point \(c\), in this case, is called a _point of minimum value_ of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\).
3. \(f\) is said to have an extreme value in \(\mathrm{I}\) if there exists a point \(c\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) such that \(f(c)\) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\).

The number \(f(c)\), in this case, is called an _extreme value_ of \(f\) in \(\mathrm{I}\) and the point \(c\) is called an _extreme point_.

_Remark_ In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular functions help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it is not even differentiable (Example 15).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:474]

One may note that the function \(f\) in Example 27 is not differentiable at \(x=0\).

**Example 16**: Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function given by

\[f(x)=x,\,x\in(0,\,1).\]

SolutionThe given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval (0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function \(f\), it seems that, it should have the minimum value at a point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate such points. Infact, if a point \(x_{{}_{0}}\) is closest to 0, then we find \(\frac{x_{{}_{0}}}{2}<x_{{}_{0}}\) for all \(x_{{}_{0}}\in(0,1)\). Also, if \(x_{{}_{1}}\) is closest to 1, then \(\frac{x_{{}_{1}}+1}{2}>x_{{}_{1}}\) for all \(x_{{}_{1}}\in(0,1)\).

Therefore, the given function has neither the maximum value nor the minimum value in the interval (0,1).

_Remark_The reader may observe that in Example 16, if we include the points 0 and 1 in the domain of \(f\), i.e., if we extend the domain of \(f\) to [0,1], then the function \(f\) has minimum value 0 at \(x=0\) and maximum value 1 at \(x=1\). Infact, we have the following results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text)

_Every monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end points of the domain of definition of the function._

A more general result is

_Every continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum value._

NoteBy a monotonic function \(f\) in an interval I, we mean that \(f\) is either increasing in I or decreasing in I.

Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be discussed later in this section.

Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.11. Observe that at points A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to increasing or vice-versa. These points may be called _turning points_ of the given function. Further, observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little valley. Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood (interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective valleys. Similarly, the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B and D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C may be regarded as points of _local minimum value_ (or _relative minimum value_) and points B and D may be regarded as points of _local maximum value_ (or _relative maximum value_) for the function. The _local maximum value_ and _local minimum value_ of the function are referred to as _local maxima_ and _local minima_, respectively, of the function.

We now formally give the following definition

**Definition 4**: Let \(f\) be a real valued function and let \(c\) be an interior point in the domain of \(f\). Then

* \(c\) is called a point of _local maxima_ if there is an \(h>0\) such that \(f(c)\geq f(x)\), for all \(x\) in \((c-h,c+h)\), \(x\neq c\) The value \(f(c)\) is called the _local maximum value_ of \(f\).
* \(c\) is called a point of _local minima_ if there is an \(h>0\) such that \(f(c)\leq f(x)\), for all \(x\) in \((c-h,c+h)\)

The value \(f(c)\) is called the _local minimum value_ of \(f\).

Geometrically, the above definition states that if \(x=c\) is a point of local maxima of \(f\), then the graph of \(f\) around \(c\) will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function \(f\) is increasing (i.e., \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\)) in the interval \((c-h,c)\) and decreasing (i.e., \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\)) in the interval \((c,c+h)\).

This suggests that \(f^{\prime}(c)\) must be zero.

**Fig 6.11**:Similarly, if \(c\) is a point of local minima of \(f\), then the graph of \(f\) around \(c\) will be as shown in Fig 6.14(b). Here \(f\) is decreasing (i.e.,\(f^{\prime}(x)<0\)) in the interval \((c-h,c)\) and increasing (i.e.,\(f^{\prime}(x)>0\)) in the interval \((c,c+h)\). This again suggest that \(f^{\prime}(c)\) must be zero.

The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof).

**Theorem 2**: Let \(f\) be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose \(c\in\) I be any point. If \(f\) has a local maxima or a local minima at \(x=c\), then either \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) or \(f\) is not differentiable at \(c\).

_Remark_: The converse of above theorem need not be true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes need not be a point of local maxima or local minima. For example, if \(f(x)=x^{3}\), then \(f^{\prime}(x)=3x^{2}\) and so \(f^{\prime}(0)=0\). But \(0\) is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima (Fig 6.13).

**Note**: A point c in the domain of a function \(f\) at which either \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) or \(f\) is not differentiable is called a _critical point_ of \(f\). Note that if \(f\) is continuous at \(c\) and \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\), then there exists an \(h>0\) such that \(f\) is differentiable in the interval \((c-h,c+h)\).

We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of local minima using only the first order derivatives.

**Theorem 3** (First Derivative Test): Let \(f\) be a function defined on an open interval I. Let \(f\) be continuous at a critical point \(c\) in I. Then

1. If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) changes sign from positive to negative as \(x\) increases through c, i.e., if \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of \(c\), and \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of \(c\), then \(c\) is a point of _local maxima_.
2. If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) changes sign from negative to positive as \(x\) increases through \(c\), i.e., if \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of \(c\), and \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of \(c\), then \(c\) is a point of _local minima_.
3. If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) does not change sign as \(x\) increases through \(c\), then \(c\) is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called _point of inflection_ (Fig 6.13).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:478]

**Example 18**: Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-6x^{2}+6x+5.\]

**Solution**: We have

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-6x^{2}+6x+5\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=6x^{2}-12x+6=6(x-1)^{2}\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=0\quad\text{at}\quad x=1\]

Thus, \(x=1\) is the only critical point of \(f\). We shall now examine this point for local maxima and/or local minima of \(f\). Observe that \(f^{\prime}(x)\geq 0\), for all \(x\in\mathbf{R}\) and in particular \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\), for values close to \(1\) and to the left and to the right of \(1\). Therefore, by first derivative test, the point \(x=1\) is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Hence \(x=1\) is a point of inflexion.

_Remark_: One may note that since \(f^{\prime}(x)\), in Example 30, never changes its sign on \(\mathbf{R}\), graph of \(f\) has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima.

We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a given function. This test is often easier to apply than the first derivative test.

**Theorem 4** (Second Derivative Test): Let \(f\) be a function defined on an interval \(I\) and \(c\in I\). Let \(f\) be twice differentiable at \(c\). Then

1. \(x=c\) is a point of local maxima if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)<0\) The value \(f(c)\) is local maximum value of \(f\).
2. \(x=c\) is a point of local minima if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)>0\) In this case, \(f(c)\) is local minimum value of \(f\).
3. The test fails if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)=0\).

In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether \(c\) is a point of local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion.

**Note**: As \(f\) is twice differentiable at \(c\), we mean second order derivative of \(f\) exists at \(c\).

**Example 19**: Find local minimum value of the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=3+\left|x\right|\), \(x\in\mathbf{R}\).

**Solution**: Note that the given function is not differentiable at \(x=0\). So, second derivative test fails. Let us try first derivative test. Note that \(0\) is a critical point of \(f\). Now to the left of \(0,f(x)=3-x\) and so \(f^{\prime}(x)=-1<0\). Also tothe right of \(0,f(x)=3+x\) and so \(f^{\prime}(x)=1>0\). Therefore, by first derivative test, \(x=0\) is a point of local minima of \(f\) and local minimum value of \(f\) is \(f(0)=3\).

**Example 20**: Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=3x^{4}+4x^{3}-12x^{2}+12\]

**Solution** We have

\[f(x)=3x^{4}+4x^{3}-12x^{2}+12\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=12x^{3}+12x^{2}-24x=12x\left(x-1\right)\left(x+2\right)\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=0\text{ at }x=0,\text{ }x=1\text{ and }x=-2.\]

Now

\[f^{\prime\prime}(x)=36x^{2}+24x-24=12\left(3x^{2}+2x-2\right)\]

or

\[\begin{cases}f^{\prime\prime}(0)&=-24<0\\ f^{\prime\prime}(1)&=36>0\\ f^{\prime\prime}(-2)&=72>0\end{cases}\]

Therefore, by second derivative test, \(x=0\) is a point of local maxima and local maximum value of \(f\) at \(x=0\) is \(f(0)=12\) while \(x=1\) and \(\bar{x}=-2\) are the points of local minima and local minimum values of \(f\) at \(x=1\) and \(-2\) are \(f(1)=7\) and \(f(-2)=-20\), respectively.

**Example 21**: Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function \(f\) given by

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-6x^{2}+6x+5.\]

**Solution** We have

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-6x^{2}+6x+5\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=6x^{2}-12x+6=6(x-1)^{2}\]

Now \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=1\). Also \(f^{\prime\prime}(1)=0\). Therefore, the second derivative test fails in this case. So, we shall go back to the first derivative test.

We have already seen (Example 18) that, using first derivative test, \(x=1\) is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion.

**Example 22**: Find two positive numbers whose sum is \(15\) and the sum of whose squares is minimum.

**Solution** Let one of the numbers be \(x\). Then the other number is \((15-x)\). Let S(\(x\)) denote the sum of the squares of these numbers. Then

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:481]

Hence, the required shortest distance is given by

\[\text{D}\bigg{(}\frac{2c-1}{2}\bigg{)}=\sqrt{\frac{2c-1}{2}+\bigg{(}\frac{2c-1}{2 }-c\bigg{)}^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{4c-1}}{2}\]

NoteThe reader may note that in Example 35, we have used first derivative test instead of the second derivative test as the former is easy and short.

**Example 24**: Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at points A and B, respectively. If AP = 16 m, BQ = 22 m and AB = 20 m, then find the distance of a point R on AB from the point A such that RP\({}^{2}+\)RQ\({}^{2}\) is minimum.

SolutionLet R be a point on AB such that AR =\(x\) m. Then RB = (20 - \(x\)) m (as AB = 20 m). From Fig 6.16, we have

\[\text{RP}^{2}=\text{AR}^{2}+\text{AP}^{2}\]

and

\[\text{RQ}^{2}=\text{RB}^{2}+\text{BQ}^{2}\]

Therefore

\[\text{RP}^{2}+\text{RQ}^{2}=\text{AR}^{2}+\text{AP}^{2}+\text{RB}^{2}+\text{BQ }^{2}\]

\[=x^{2}+(16)^{2}+(20-x)^{2}+(22)^{2}\]

\[=2x^{2}-40x+1140\]

Let

\[\text{S}=\text{S}(x)=\text{RP}^{2}+\text{RQ}^{2}=2x^{2}-40x+1140.\]

Therefore

\[\text{S}^{\prime}(x)=4x-40.\]

Now S\({}^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=10\). Also S\({}^{\prime\prime}(x)=4>0\), for all \(x\) and so S\({}^{\prime\prime}(10)>0\). Therefore, by second derivative test, \(x=10\) is the point of local minima of S. Thus, the distance of R from A on AB is AR = \(x=\)10 m.

**Example 25**: If length of three sides of a trapezium other than base are equal to 10cm, then find the area of the trapezium when it is maximum.

SolutionThe required trapezium is as given in Fig 6.17. Draw perpendiculars DP and CQ on AB. Let \(\mathrm{AP}=x\) cm. Note that \(\Delta\mathrm{APD}\sim\Delta\mathrm{BQC}\). Therefore, \(\mathrm{QB}=x\) cm. Also, by Pythagoras theorem, \(\mathrm{DP}=\mathrm{QC}=\sqrt{100-x^{2}}\). Let \(\mathrm{A}\) be the area of the trapezium. Then

\[\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}(x) =\frac{1}{2}\left(\text{sum of parallel sides}\right)\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\left(2x+10+10\right)\left(\sqrt{100-x^{2}}\right)\] \[=(x+10)\left(\sqrt{100-x^{2}}\right)\] \[\mathrm{A}^{\prime}(x) =(x+10)\frac{(-2x)}{2\sqrt{100-x^{2}}}+\left(\sqrt{100-x^{2}}\right)\] \[=\frac{-2x^{2}-10x+100}{\sqrt{100-x^{2}}}\]

Now \(\mathrm{A}^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(2x^{2}+10x-100=0\), i.e., \(x=5\) and \(x=-10\).

Since \(x\) represents distance, it can not be negative.

So,

\[\mathrm{A}^{\prime\prime}(x) =\frac{\sqrt{100-x^{2}}\left(-4x-10\right)-(-2x^{2}-10x+100)\frac{ (-2x)}{2\sqrt{100-x^{2}}}}{100-x^{2}}\] \[=\frac{2\sqrt[3]{3}-300x-1000}{(100-x^{2})^{2}}\] (on simplification)

or

\[\mathrm{A}^{\prime\prime}(5)=\frac{2(5)^{3}-300(5)-1000}{(100-(5)^{2})^{2}}= \frac{-2250}{75\sqrt{75}}=\frac{-30}{\sqrt{75}}<0\]

Thus, area of trapezium is maximum at \(x=5\) and the area is given by

\[\mathrm{A}(5)=(5+10)\sqrt{100-(5)^{2}}= 15\sqrt{75}=75\sqrt{3}\text{ cm}^{2}\]

**Example 26**: Prove that the radius of the right circular cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone.

SolutionLet \(\mathrm{OC}=r\) be the radius of the cone and \(\mathrm{OA}=h\) be its height. Let a cylinder with radius \(\mathrm{OE}=x\) inscribed in the given cone (Fig 6.18). The height QE of the cylinder is given by 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:484]

minimum value is \(f(b)\). The function also has a local maxima at \(x=c\) and local maximum value is \(f(c)\).

Also from the graph, it is evident that \(f\) has absolute maximum value \(f(a)\) and absolute minimum value \(f(d)\). Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum) value of \(f\) is different from local maximum (minimum) value of \(f\).

We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I.

**Theorem 5** Let \(f\) be a continuous function on an interval I = \([a\), \(b]\). Then \(f\) has the absolute maximum value and \(f\) attains it at least once in I. Also, \(f\) has the absolute minimum value and attains it at least once in I.

**Theorem 6** Let \(f\) be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let \(c\) be any interior point of I. Then

(i) \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) if \(f\) attains its absolute maximum value at \(c\).

(ii) \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) if \(f\) attains its absolute minimum value at \(c\).

In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval \([a\), \(b]\).

**Working Rule**

Step 1: Find all critical points of \(f\) in the interval, i.e., find points \(x\) where either \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) or \(f\) is not differentiable.

Step 2: Take the end points of the interval.

Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of \(f\).

Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of \(f\) out of the values calculated in Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of \(f\) and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of \(f\).

**Example 27** Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a function \(f\)given by

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-15x^{2}+36x+1\text{ on the interval \@@cite[cite]{[\@@bibref{}{}{}{}]}, \@@cite[cite]{[\@@bibref{}{}{}{}]}.\]

**Solution** We have

\[f(x)=2x^{3}-15x^{2}+36x+1\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=6x^{2}-30x+36=6\left(x-3\right)\left(x-2\right)\]

Note that \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=2\) and \(x=3\).

We shall now evaluate the value of \(f\)at these points and at the end points of the interval [1, 5], i.e., at \(x=1\), \(x=2\), \(x=3\) and at \(x=5\). So

\[f(1)=2\left(1^{3}\right)-15\left(1^{2}\right)+36\left(1\right)+1=24\]

\[f(2)=2\left(2^{3}\right)-15\left(2^{2}\right)+36\left(2\right)+1=29\]

\[f(3)=2\left(3^{3}\right)-15\left(3^{2}\right)+36\left(3\right)+1=28\]

\[f(5)=2\left(5^{3}\right)-15\left(5^{2}\right)+36\left(5\right)+1=56\]

Thus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of \(f\)on\(\left[1,5\right]\) is \(56\), occurring at \(x=5\), and absolute minimum value of \(f\)on\(\left[1,5\right]\) is \(24\) which occurs at \(x=1\).

**Example 28** Find absolute maximum and minimum values of a function \(f\)given by

**Solution** We have

\[f(x)=12x^{\frac{4}{3}}-6x^{\frac{1}{3}}\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=16x^{\frac{1}{3}}-\frac{2}{x^{3}}=\frac{2\left(8x-1\right)}{x^{ \frac{2}{3}}}\]

Thus, \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=\frac{1}{8}\). Further note that \(f^{\prime}(x)\) is not defined at \(x=0\). So the critical points are \(x=0\) and \(x=\frac{1}{8}\). Now evaluating the value of \(f\)at critical points \(x=0\), \(\frac{1}{8}\) and at end points of the interval \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\), we have

\[f(-1)=12\left(-1\right)^{\frac{4}{3}}-6\left(-1\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}=18\]

\[f(0)=12\left(0\right)-6\left(0\right)=0\]\[\begin{split}\cdot& f\bigg{(}\frac{1}{8}\bigg{)}=12\bigg{(} \frac{1}{8}\bigg{)}^{\frac{4}{3}}-6\bigg{(}\frac{1}{8}\bigg{)}^{\frac{1}{3}}= \frac{-9}{4}\\ & f(1)=12(1)^{\frac{4}{3}}-6(1)^{\frac{1}{3}}=6\end{split}\]

Hence, we conclude that absolute maximum value of \(f\) is 18 that occurs at \(x=-1\) and absolute minimum value of \(f\) is \(\frac{-9}{4}\) that occurs at \(x=\frac{1}{8}\).

**Example 29**: An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the curve given by \(y=x^{2}+7\). A soldier, placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is nearest to him. Find the nearest distance.

SolutionFor each value of \(x\), the helicopter's position is at point (\(x\), \(x^{2}+7\)). Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is

\[\cdot\sqrt{\big{(}x-3\big{)}^{2}+\big{(}x^{2}+7-7\big{)}^{2}}\text{, i.e., }\sqrt{\big{(}x-3\big{)}^{2}+x^{4}}\]

Let

\[f(x)=(x-3)^{2}+x^{4}\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=2(x-3)+4x^{3}=2(x-1)\ (2x^{2}+2x+3)\]

Thus, \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=\mathbb{I}\) or \(2x^{2}+2x+3=0\) for which there are no real roots. Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which \(f^{\prime}\) is zero, i.e., there is only one point, namely, \(x=\mathbb{I}\). The value of \(f\) at this point is given by \(f(1)=(1-3)^{2}+(1)^{4}=5\). Thus, the distance between the solder and the helicopter is \(\cdot\sqrt{f(1)}=\sqrt{5}\).

Note that \(\cdot\sqrt{5}\) is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since

\[\cdot\sqrt{f(0)}=\sqrt{\big{(}0-3\big{)}^{2}+\big{(}0\big{)}^{4}}=3>\sqrt{5}\,\]

it follows that \(\cdot\sqrt{5}\) is the minimum value of \(\cdot\sqrt{f(x)}\). Hence, \(\cdot\sqrt{5}\) is the minimum distance between the soldier and the helicopter.

Choose the correct answer in Questions 27 and 29.

**27.** The point on the curve \(x^{2}=2y\) which is nearest to the point \((0,\,5)\) is

(A) \((2\sqrt{2},4)\) (B) \((2\sqrt{2},0)\) (C) \((0,0)\) (D) \((2,2)\)

(A) \(\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^{\dfrac{1}{3}}\) (B) \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) (C) \(1\) (D) \(0\)

**29.** A car starts from a point P at time \(t=0\) seconds and stops at point Q. The distance \(x\), in metres, covered by it, in \(t\) seconds is given by

\(x=t^{2}\left(2-\dfrac{t}{3}\right)\)

Find the time taken by it to reach Q and also find distance between P and Q.

**Solution** Let \(v\) be the velocity of the car at \(t\) seconds.

Now

\(x=t^{2}\left(2-\dfrac{t}{3}\right)\)

Therefore

\(v=\dfrac{dx}{dt}=4t-t^{2}=t(4-t)\)

Thus, \(v=0\) gives \(t=0\) and/or \(t=4\).

Now \(v=0\) at P as well as at Q and at P, \(t=0\). So, at Q, \(t=4\). Thus, the car will reach the point Q after 4 seconds. Also the distance travelled in 4 seconds is given by

\(x\big{]}_{t-4}=4^{2}\left(2-\dfrac{4}{3}\right)=16\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)= \dfrac{32}{3}\)m

**Example 31**: A water tank has the shape of an inverted right circular cone with its axis vertical and vertex lowermost. Its semi-vertical angle is \(\tan^{-1}(0.5)\). Water is poured into it at a constant rate of 5 cubic metre per hour. Find the rate at which the level of the water is rising at the instant when the depth of water in the tank is 4 m.

Solution Let \(r\), \(h\) and \(\alpha\) be as in Fig 6.20. Then \(\tan\alpha=\dfrac{r}{h}\).

So

\[\alpha=\tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{r}{h}\right).\]

But

\[\alpha=\tan^{-1}(0.5)\quad\text{(given)}\]

or

\[\dfrac{r}{h}=0.5\]

or

\[r=\dfrac{h}{2}\]

Let V be the volume of the cone. Then

Therefore

\[\dfrac{d\text{V}}{dt}=\dfrac{d}{dh}\left(\dfrac{\pi h^{3}}{12}\right)\cdot \dfrac{dh}{dt}\]

Now rate of change of volume, i.e., \(\dfrac{d\text{V}}{dt}=5\,\text{m}^{3}/\text{h}\) and \(h=4\) m.

Therefore

\[5=\dfrac{\pi}{4}\left(4\right)^{2}\cdot\dfrac{dh}{dt}\]

or

\[\dfrac{dh}{dt}=\dfrac{5}{4\pi}=\dfrac{35}{88}\,\text{m}/\text{h}\left(\pi= \dfrac{22}{7}\right)\]

Thus, the rate of change of water level is \(\dfrac{35}{88}\,\text{m}/\text{h}\).

**Example 32**: A man of height 2 metres walks at a uniform speed of 5 km/h away from a lamp post which is 6 metres high. Find the rate at which the length of his shadow increases.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:492]

Now \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=1,x=-2\), or \(x=3\). The points \(x=1,-2\), and \(3\) divide the real line into four disjoint intervals namely, \((-\infty,-2)\), \((-2,1)\), \((1,3)\) and \((3,\infty)\) (Fig 6.22).

Consider the interval \((-\infty,-2)\), i.e., when \(-\infty<x<-2\). In this case, we have \(x-1<0\), \(x+2<0\) and \(x-3<0\).

(In particular, observe that for \(x=-3,f^{\prime}(x)=(x-1)\)\((x+2)\)\((x-3)=(-4)\)\((-1)\)\((-6)<0\))

Therefore, \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) when \(-\infty<x<-2\).

Thus, the function \(f\)is decreasing in \((-\infty,-2)\).

Consider the interval \((-2,1)\), i.e., when \(-2<x<1\).

In this case, we have \(x-1<0\), \(x+2>0\) and \(x-3<0\)

(In particular, observe that for \(x=0,f^{\prime}(x)=(x-1)\)\((x+2)\)\((x-3)=(-1)\)\((2)\)\((-3)\)\(=6>0\))

So \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) when \(-2<x<1\).

Thus, \(f\)is increasing in \((-2,1)\).

Now consider the interval \((1,3)\), i.e., when \(1<x<3\). In this case, we have \(x-1>0\), \(x-3<0\) and \(x-3<0\). So \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) when \(1<x<3\).

Thus, \(f\)is decreasing in \((1,3)\).

Finally, consider the interval \((3,\infty)\), i.e., when \(x>3\). In this case, we have \(x-1>0\), \(x+2>0\) and \(x-3>0\). So \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) when \(x>3\).

Thus, \(f\)is increasing in the interval \((3,\infty)\).

**Example 34**: Show that the function \(f\)given by

\[f(x)=\tan^{-1}(\sin x+\cos x),\,x>0\]

is always an increasing function in \(\left(0,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\).

**Solution** We have

\[\begin{array}{l}f(x)=\tan^{-1}(\sin x+\cos x),\,x>0\\.\\ f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{1+\left(\sin x+\cos x\right)^{2}}\left(\cos x-\sin x\right) \end{array}\]\[=\frac{\cos x-\sin x}{2+\sin 2x}\] (on simplification) \[.\]

Note that \(2+\sin 2x>0\) for all \(x\) in \(0,\frac{\pi}{4}\).

Therefore \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) if \(\cos x-\sin x>0\) or \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) if \(\cos x>\sin x\) or \(\cot x>1\).

Now \(\cot x>1\) if \(\tan x<1\), i.e., if \(0<x<\frac{\pi}{4}\)

Thus \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) in \(\left(0,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\)

Hence \(f\) is increasing function in \(\left(0,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\).

**Example 35** A circular disc of radius 3 cm is being heated. Due to expansion, its radius increases at the rate of 0.05 cm/s. Find the rate at which its area is increasing when radius is 3.2 cm.

**Solution** Let \(r\) be the radius of the given disc and A be its area. Then

or (by Chain Rule)

Now approximate rate of increase of radius \(=dr=\frac{dr}{dt}\Delta t=0.05\) cm/s.

Therefore, the approximate rate of increase in area is given by

\[dA=\frac{dA}{dt}(\Delta t)\ =\ 2\pi\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\Delta t\right)\]

\[=2\pi\left(3.2\right)\left(0.05\right)=0.320\pi\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/s}\ \ \ \left(r=3.2\ \mathrm{cm}\right)\]

**Solution** Let \(\mathrm{S}(x)\) be the selling price of \(x\) items and let \(\mathrm{C}(x)\) be the cost price of \(x\) items. Then, we have

\[\mathrm{S}(x) =\overset{\cdot}{\left(5-\frac{x}{100}\right)}x=5x-\frac{x^{2}}{100}\] \[\mathrm{C}(x) =\frac{x}{5}+500\]

Thus, the profit function \(\mathrm{P}(x)\) is given by

\[\mathrm{P}(x) =\mathrm{S}(x)-\mathrm{C}(x)=5x-\frac{x^{2}}{100}-\frac{x}{5}-500\] \[\mathrm{P}(x) =\frac{\overset{\cdot}{24}}{5}x-\frac{x^{2}}{100}-500\]

or

\[\overset{\cdot}{\left(5-\frac{x}{50}\right)}.\]

Now \(\mathrm{P}^{\prime}(x)=0\) gives \(x=240\). Also \(\mathrm{P}^{\prime}(x)=\frac{-1}{50}\). So \(\mathrm{P}^{\prime}(240)=\overset{-1}{50}<0\)

Thus, \(x=240\) is a point of maxima. Hence, the manufacturer can earn maximum profit, if he sells 240 items.

### Summary

* If a quantity \(y\) varies with another quantity \(x\), satisfying some rule \(y=f(x)\), then \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\) (or \(\overset{\cdot}{f^{\prime}}(x)\) ) represents the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) and \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\) (or \(\overset{\cdot}{f^{\prime}}(x_{0})\) ) represents the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) at \(x=x_{0}\).
* If two variables \(x\) and \(y\) are varying with respect to another variable \(t\), i.e., if \(x=f(t)\) and \(\overset{\cdot}{y=g(t)}\), then by Chain Rule \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{dy}{dt}\) / \(\dfrac{dx}{dt}\), if \(\dfrac{dx}{dt}\neq 0\).
* A function \(f\) is said to be (a) increasing on an interval (\(a\), \(b\)) if \(x_{1}<x_{2}\) in (\(a\), \(b\)) \(\Rightarrow\)\(f(x_{1})<\)\(f(x_{2})\) for all \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\in(a\), \(b)\). Alternatively, if \(f^{\prime}(x)\geq 0\) for each \(x\) in (\(a\), \(b\)) (b) decreasing on (\(a\),\(b\)) if \(x_{1}<x_{2}\) in (\(a\), \(b\)) \(\Rightarrow\)\(f(x_{1})>\)\(f(x_{2})\) for all \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\in(a\), \(b)\). (c) constant in (\(a\), \(b\)), if \(f(x)=c\) for all \(x\in(a\), \(b)\), where \(c\) is a constant.
* A point \(c\) in the domain of a function \(f\) at which either \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) or \(f\) is not differentiable is called a _critical point_ of \(f\).
* _First Derivative Test_ Let \(f\) be a function defined on an open interval I. Let \(f\) be continuous at a critical point \(c\) in I. Then (i) If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) changes sign from positive to negative as \(x\) increases through c, i.e., if \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of \(c\), and \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of \(c\), then \(c\) is a point of _local maxima_.

* If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) changes sign from negative to positive as \(x\) increases through \(c\), i.e., if \(f^{\prime}(x)<0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of \(c\), and \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of \(c\), then \(c\) is a point of _local minima_.
* If \(f^{\prime}(x)\) does not change sign as \(x\) increases through \(c\), then \(c\) is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called _point of inflexion_.
* _Second Derivative Test_ Let \(f\) be a function defined on an interval I and \(c\in\) I. Let \(f\) be twice differentiable at \(c\). Then
* \(x=c\) is a point of local maxima if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)<0\)
* The values \(f(c)\) is local maximum value of \(f\).
* \(x=c\) is a point of local minima if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)>0\)
* In this case, \(f(c)\) is local minimum value of \(f\).
* The test fails if \(f^{\prime}(c)=0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(c)=0\). In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether \(c\) is a point of maxima, minima or a point of inflexion.
* Working rule for finding absolute maxima and/or absolute minima Step 1: Find all critical points of \(f\) in the interval, i.e., find points \(x\) where either \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\) or \(f\) is not differentiable. Step 2:Take the end points of the interval. Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of \(f\). Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of \(f\) out of the values calculated in Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum value of \(f\) and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum value of \(f\).

### Introduction

Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of the functions.

If a function \(f\) is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its derivative \(f\)'exists at each point of I, then a natural question arises that given \(f\)'at each point of I can we determine the function? The functions that could possibly have given function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives all these anti derivatives is called the _indefinite integral_ of the function and such process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:

1. the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,
2. the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain conditions.

These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and definite integrals, which together constitute the _Integral Calculus_.

There is a connection, known as the _Fundamental Theorem of Calculus_, between indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.

### Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation

Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function, we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original function. Such a process is called _integration_ or _anti differentiation_.

Let us consider the following examples:

We know that \[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\sin x\right)=\cos x\\ \cdot\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\dfrac{x^{3}}{3}\right)=x^{2}\\ \cdot\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(e^{x}\right)=e^{x}\end{array}...\] (1)

(2)

and \[\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(e^{x}\right)=e^{x}\]... (3)

We observe that in (1), the function \(\cos x\) is the derived function of \(\sin x\). We say that \(\sin x\) is an anti derivative (or an integral) of \(\cos x\). Similarly, in (2) and (3), \(\dfrac{x^{3}}{3}\) and \(e^{x}\) are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of \(x^{2}\) and \(e^{x}\), respectively. Again, we note that for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :.

Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique. Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason C is customarily referred to as _arbitrary constant_. In fact, C is the _parameter_ by varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.

More generally, if there is a function F such that \(\dfrac{d}{dx}\operatorname{F}\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\), \(\forall\)\(x\in\operatorname{I}\) (interval), then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called _constant of integration_)

\[\dfrac{d}{dx}\left[\operatorname{F}\left(x\right)+\operatorname{C}\right]=f( x),\,x\in\operatorname{I}\]Thus, \(\{\text{F}+\text{C},\text{C}\in\,\mathbf{R}\}\) denotes a family of anti derivatives of \(f.\)

_Remark_ Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let \(g\) and \(h\) be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.

Consider the function \(f=g-h\) defined by \(f(x)=g(x)-h(x)\), \(\forall\ x\in\,\text{I}\)

Then

\[\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\cdot}df}{dx}=f^{\prime}=g^{\prime}-h^{\prime}\,\text{ giving}\,\,\,f^{\prime}(x)=g^{\prime}(x)-h^{\prime}(x)\,\,\forall\ x\in\,\text{I}\]

or

\[f^{\prime}(x)=0,\,\overset{\cdot}{\forall}\ x\in\,\text{I}\text{ by hypothesis,}\]

i.e., the rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) is zero on I and hence \(f\) is constant.

In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family \(\{\text{F}+\text{C},\text{C}\in\,\mathbf{R}\}\) provides all possible anti derivatives of \(f.\)

We introduce a new symbol, namely, \(\int f(x)\,dx\) which will represent the entire class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of \(f\) with respect to \(x.\)

Symbolically, we write \(\overset{\cdot}{\cdot}f(x)\,dx=\text{F}(x)+\text{C}.\)

**Notation** Given that \(\overset{\cdot}{\cdot}\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f\) (\(x\)), we write \(y=\int f\) (\(x\)) \(dx.\)

For the sake of convenience, we mention below the following symbols/terms/phrases with their meanings as given in the Table (7.1).

3. We have \(\int(x^{\frac{3}{2}}+2\,e^{x}-\frac{1}{x})\,dx=\int x^{\frac{3}{2}}\,dx+\int 2 \,e^{x}\,dx-\int\frac{1}{x}\,dx\) \[=\frac{\frac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}+1}{3}+2\,e^{x}-\log\big{|}x\big{|}+C}{ \frac{2}{2}+1}\] \[=\frac{2}{5}\,x^{\frac{5}{2}}+2\,e^{x}-\log\big{|}x\big{|}+C\]

**Example 3** Find the following integrals:

1. \(\int(\sin\,x+\cos\,x)\,dx\) (ii) \(\int\) cosec \(x\,(\)cosec \(x+\cot\,x)\,dx\)
2. \(\int\frac{1-\sin\,x}{\cos^{2}\,x}\,dx\)

**Solution**

1. We have \(\int(\sin\,x+\cos\,x)\,dx=\int\sin\,x\,dx+\int\) cos \(x\,dx\) \[=-\cos\,x+\sin x+C\]
2. We have \(\int(\)cosec \(x\,(\)cosec \(x+\cot\,x)\,dx=\int\) cosec\(x\,dx+\int\) cosec \(x\cot\,x\)
3. We have \(\int\frac{1-\sin\,x}{\cos^{2}x}\,dx=\int\frac{1}{\cos^{2}x}\,dx- \int\frac{\sin\,x}{\cos^{2}x}\,dx\) \[=\int\) sec\({}^{2}x\,dx-\int\tan\,x\,\sec\,x\,dx\) \[\tan\,x-\sec\,x+C\]

**Example 4** Find the anti derivative F of \(f\) defined by \(f(x)=4x^{3}-6\), where F (0) = 3

**Solution** One anti derivative of \(f(x)\) is \(x^{4}-6x\) since

\[\frac{d}{dx}\,(x^{4}-6x)\,=4x^{3}-6\]

Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by

\[\text{F}(x)=x^{4}-6x+C,\text{ where }C\text{ is constant.}\]Given that \(\mathrm{F}(0)=3\), which gives, \[3=0-6\times 0+\mathrm{C}\quad\text{or}\quad\mathrm{C}=3\] Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function \(\mathrm{F}\) defined by \[\mathrm{F}(x)=x^{4}-6x+3.\]

_Remarks_

1. We see that if \(\mathrm{F}\) is an anti derivative of \(f\), then so is \(\mathrm{F}+\mathrm{C}\), where \(\mathrm{C}\) is any constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative \(\mathrm{F}\) of a function \(f\), we can write down an infinite number of anti derivatives of \(f\) by adding any constant to \(\mathrm{F}\) expressed by \(\mathrm{F}(x)\,+\mathrm{C},\mathrm{C}\in\,\mathbf{R}\). In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an additional condition which then determines a specific value of \(\mathrm{C}\) giving unique anti derivative of the given function.
2. Sometimes, \(\mathrm{F}\) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are therefore blocked for finding \(\int f(x)\ dx\). For example, it is not possible to find \(\int\!e^{-x^{2}}\ dx\) by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is \(\ e^{-x^{2}}\)
3. When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than \(x\), the integral formulae are modified accordingly. For instance. \[\int y^{4}\ dy=\frac{y^{4+1}}{4+1}+\mathrm{C}=\frac{1}{5}\ y^{5}+\mathrm{C}\]

Find an anti derivative (or integral) of the following functions by the method of inspection.

**(10) For the evaluation of the integral of the type** \(\int\frac{(px+q)\ dx}{\sqrt{ax^{2}+bx+c}}\), we proceed as in (9) and transform the integral into known standard forms.

Let us illustrate the above methods by some examples.

**Example 8**: Find the following integrals:

\(\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-16}\) (ii)\(\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x-x^{2}}}\)

**Solution**

(i) We have \(\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-16}=\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-4^{2}}=\frac{1}{8}\log \left|\frac{x-4}{x+4}\right|+\mathrm{C}\) [by 7.4 (1)]

(ii) \(\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x-x^{2}}}=\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-\left(x-1\right)^{2}}}\)

Put \(x-1=t\). Then \(dx=dt\).

Therefore, \(\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x-x^{2}}}=\int\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^{2}}}=\sin^{-1}\left(t \right)+\mathrm{C}\) [by 7.4 (5)]

**Example 9**: Find the following integrals:

\(\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-6x+13}\) (ii)\(\int\frac{dx}{3x^{2}+13x-10}\) (iii)\(\int\frac{dx}{\sqrt{5x^{2}-2x}}\)

**Solution**

(i) We have \(x^{2}=6x+13=x^{2}-6x+3^{2}-3^{2}+13=(x-3)^{2}+4\)

So, \(\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-6x+13}=\int\frac{1}{\left(x-3\right)^{2}+2^{2}}\ dx\)

Let \(\cdot\)\(x-3=t\). Then \(dx=dt\)

Therefore, \(\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-6x+13}=\cdot\)\(\int\frac{dt}{t^{2}+2^{2}}=\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\frac{t}{2}+\mathrm{C}\) [by 7.4 (3)]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:523]

3. We have \(\int\!\frac{dx}{\sqrt{5x^{2}-2x}}=\int\!\frac{dx}{\sqrt{5\!\left(x^{2}-\frac{2x}{5 }\right)}}\) \[=\frac{\cdot}{\sqrt{5}}\int\!\frac{dx}{\sqrt{\!\left(x-\frac{1}{5} \right)^{2}-\!\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{2}}}\ \ (\text{completing the square})\] \[\.\] Put \(x-\frac{1}{5}=t\). Then \(dx=dt\). Therefore, \(\int\!\frac{dx}{\sqrt{5x^{2}-2x}}=\frac{\cdot}{\sqrt{5}}\int\!\frac{dt}{\sqrt {t^{2}-\!\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{2}}}\)

**Example 10** Find the following integrals:

1. \(\int\!\frac{x+2}{2x^{2}+6x+5}\,dx\)
2. \(\int\!\frac{x+3}{2x^{2}+6x+5}\,dx\)
3. \(\int\!\frac{x+2}{2x^{2}+6x+5}\,dx\)
4. \(\int\!\frac{x+3}{5-4x-x^{2}}\,dx\)

**Solution**

1. Using the formula 7.4 (9), we express \(x+2=\operatorname{A}\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(2x^{2}+6x+5\right)+ \operatorname{B}=\operatorname{A}\left(4x+6\right)+\operatorname{B}\) Equating the coefficients of \(x\) and the constant terms from both sides, we get \(4\operatorname{A}=1\) and \(6\operatorname{A}+\operatorname{B}=2\) or \(\operatorname{A}=\frac{1}{4}\) and \(\operatorname{B}=\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(\int\!\frac{x+2}{2x^{2}+6x+5}=\frac{\cdot}{4}\int\!\frac{4x+6}{2x^{2}+6x+5}dx+ \frac{1}{2}\int\!\frac{dx}{2x^{2}+6x+5}\) \[=\frac{1}{4}\operatorname{I}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{I}_{2}\ \ \ \ ( \text{say})\ \In \(I_{1}\), put \(2x^{2}+6x+5=t\), so that \((4x+6)\ dx=dt\)

Therefore, \[I_{1} =\int\frac{dt}{t}=\log\left|t\right|+C_{1}\] \[=\log\left|\,2x^{2}+6x+5\right|+C_{1}\]... (2) and \[I_{2} =\int\frac{dx}{2x^{2}+6x+5}=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}+3x+ \frac{5}{2}}\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{dx}{\left(x+\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}+\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}}\] \[\cdot\] Put \(x+\frac{3}{2}=t\), so that \(dx=dt\), we get \[I_{2} =\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{dt}{t^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{2\times 2 }\tan^{-1}2t+C_{2}\] [by 7.4 (3)] \[\cdot\] Using (2) and (3) in (1), we get \[\int\frac{x+2}{2x^{2}+6x+5}\ dx=\frac{1}{4}\log\left|2x^{2}+6x+5\right|+\frac {1}{2}\tan^{-1}\left(2x+3\right)+C\] where, \[C=\frac{\cdot}{4}+\frac{C_{2}}{2}\]
2. This integral is of the form given in 7.4 (10). Let us express \[x+3=\text{ A }\frac{d}{dx}\left(5-4x-x^{2}\right)+\text{B }=\text{ A }(-4-2x)+\text{B}\] Equating the coefficients of \(x\) and the constant terms from both sides, we get \[-2\text{A}=1\text{ and }-4\text{ A}+\text{B }=3\text{, i.e., }\text{A}=-\frac{1}{2}\text{ and B }=1\]

functions by long division process. Thus, if \(\frac{\mathrm{P}(x)}{\mathrm{Q}(x)}\) is improper, then \(\frac{\mathrm{P}(x)}{\mathrm{Q}(x)}=\mathrm{T}(x)+\frac{\mathrm{P}_{1}(x)}{ \mathrm{Q}(x)}\), where \(\mathrm{T}(x)\) is a polynomial in \(x\) and \(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{1}(x)}{\mathrm{Q}(x)}\) is a proper rational function. As we know how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into linear and quadratic factors. Assume that we want to evaluate \(\int\frac{\mathrm{P}(x)}{\mathrm{Q}(x)}\ dx\), where \(\frac{\mathrm{P}(x)}{\mathrm{Q}(x)}\) is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this, the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with various kind of rational functions.

In the above table, A, B and C are real numbers to be determined suitably.

### Integration by Parts

In this section, we describe one more method of integration, that is found quite useful in integrating products of functions.

If \(u\) and \(v\) are any two differentiable functions of a single variable \(x\) (say). Then, by the product rule of differentiation, we have

\[\frac{\cdot}{dx}\left(uv\right) = u\frac{dv}{dx}+v\frac{du}{dx}\] Integrating both sides, we get. \[uv = \int u\frac{dv}{dx}\,dx+\int v\frac{du}{dx}\,dx\] or \[\int u\frac{dv}{dx}dx = uv-\int v\frac{du}{dx}dx\]...

Let

\[u = f(x)\text{ and }\frac{dv}{dx}=\text{g}(x)\text{. Then }\] \[\cdot\frac{du}{dx} = f^{\prime}(x)\text{ and }v=\int g(x)\,dx\]Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as

\[\int f(x)\ g(x)\ dx\ =\ \overset{\cdot}{f}(x)\int g(x)\ dx-\int[\int g(x)\ dx]\ f ^{\prime}(x)\ dx\]

i.e.,

\[\int f(x)\ g(x)\ dx\ =\ \overset{\cdot}{f}(x)\int g(x)\ dx-\int[\ f^{\prime} (x)\int g(x)\ dx]\ dx\]

If we take \(f\) as the first function and \(g\) as the second function, then this formula may be stated as follows:

**"The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) \(\times\) (integral of the second function) - Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function) \(\times\) (integral of the second function)]?**

**Example 17**: Find \(\int x\cos x\ dx\)

**Solution** Put \(f(x)=x\) (first function) and \(g(x)=\cos x\) (second function).

Then, integration by parts gives

\[\int x\cos x\ dx\ =\ \overset{\cdot}{x}\int[\cos x\ dx-\int[\frac{d}{dx}(x) \int\cos x\ dx]\ dx\]

\[\ =\ \overset{\cdot}{x}\sin x-\int[\sin x\ dx=x\ \sin x+\cos x+C\]

Suppose, we take

\[\overset{\cdot}{f}(x)=\cos x\ \text{and}\ \overset{\cdot}{g}(x)=x.\]

Thus, it shows that the integral \(\int x\cos x\ dx\) is reduced to the comparatively more complicated integral having more power of \(x.\) Therefore, the proper choice of the first function and the second function is significant.

_Remarks_

1. It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for \(\int\sqrt[]{x}\ \sin\ x\ dx\). The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is \(\sqrt[]{x}\ \sin x.\)
2. Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function \(\cos x\)as \(\sin\,x+k\), where \(k\) is any constant, then \[\dot{\int}\,x\cos\,x\,dx =\,\overset{\cdot}{x}\,(\sin\,x+k)-\int(\sin\,x+k)\,dx\] \[=\,x\,(\sin\,x+k)-\int(\sin\,x\,dx-\int k\,dx\] \[=\,\overset{\cdot}{x}\,(\sin\,x+k)-\cos\,x-kx+\,\overset{\cdot}{ =\,x\,\sin\,x+\cos\,x+\,\mathbb{C}}\] This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of integration by parts.
3. Usually, if any function is a power of \(x\) or a polynomial in \(x\), then we take it as the first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.

**Example 18**: Find \(\int\log\,x\,dx\)

**Solution** To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is \(\log\,x\). We take \(\log\,x\) as the first function and the constant function \(1\) as the second function. Then, the integral of the second function is \(x\).

Hence, \[\dot{\int}\,(\log x.1)\,dx =\,\log\,x\,\int 1\,dx-\int[\frac{d}{d\dot{x}}\,(\log\,x)\, \int 1\,dx]\,dx\] \[=\,(\log\,x)\,\overset{\cdot}{x}\,\overset{\cdot}{x}\,dx=\,x\, \log\,x-x+\mathbb{C}\,.\]

**Example 19**: Find \(\dot{\int}\,x\,e^{x}dx\)

**Solution** Take first function as \(x\) and second function as \(e^{x}\). The integral of the second function is \(e^{x}\).

Therefore, \[\dot{\int}\,x\,e^{x}dx =\,x\,e^{x}-\int 1\,e^{x}dx\,=xe^{x}-e^{x}+\mathbb{C}.\]

**Example 20**: Find \(\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\,dx\)

**Solution** Let first function be \(\sin\,^{-1}x\) and second function be \(\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\).

First we find the integral of the second function, i.e., \(\int\dfrac{x\,dx}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\).

Put \(t=\)\(1-x^{2}\). Then \(dt=\)\(-\,2x\,dx\)

### Definite Integral

In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\), where \(a\) is called the lower limit of the integral and \(b\) is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the interval \([a,\,b]\), then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end points, i.e., F(\(b\)) - F(\(a\)).

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

#### 7.8.1 Area function

We have defined \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\) as the area of the region bounded by the curve \(y=f(x)\), the ordinates \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) and \(x\)-axis. Let \(x\) be a given point in \([a,\,b]\). Then \(\int_{a}^{x}f(x)\,dx\) represents the area of the light shaded region in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that \(f(x)>0\) for \(x\in[a,\,b]\), the assertion made below is equally true for other functions as well]. The area of this shaded region depends upon the value of \(x\).

In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of \(x\). We denote this function of \(x\) by A(\(x\)). We call the function A(\(x\)) as _Area function_ and is given by

\[\textbf{A(}x\textbf{)=}\int_{a}^{x}f(x)\,dx\]... (1)

Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given. However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.

#### 7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus

Theorem 1 Let \(f\) be a continuous function on the closed interval \([a,\,b]\) and let A (\(x\)) be the area function. Then \(\textbf{A^{\prime}(x)=}f(x)\), for all \(x\in[a,\,b]\).

#### 7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus

We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals by making use of anti derivative.

**Theorem 2** Let \(f\) be continuous function defined on the closed interval \([a,b]\) and F be an anti derivative of \(f.\) Then \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\overset{\cdot}{[\text{F}(x)]}_{a}^{b}=\text{F}\left(b \right)-\text{F}(a).\)

_Remarks_

1. In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx=(\)value of the anti derivative F of \(f\) at the upper limit \(b\) - value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit \(a).\)
2. This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.
3. The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship between differentiation and integration.
4. In \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx\), the function \(f\) needs to be well defined and continuous in \([a,b].\) For instance, the consideration of definite integral \(\int_{-2}^{3}x(x^{2}-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}\ dx\) is erroneous since the function \(f\) expressed by \(f(x)=\ x(x^{2}-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}\) is not defined in a portion \(-1<x<1\) of the closed interval \([-2,\,3].\)

**Steps for calculating \(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx\)**.

1. Find the indefinite integral \(\int f(x)\ dx\). Let this be F(\(x\)). There is no need to keep integration constant C because if we consider F(\(x\)) + C instead of F(\(x\)), we get \(\int_{a}^{\cdot}f(x)dx=\left[\text{F}\left(x\right)+\text{C}\right]_{a}^{b}= \left[\text{F}(b)+\text{C}\right]-\left[\text{F}(a)+\text{C}\right]=\text{F}( b)-\text{F}(a)\). Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite integral.
2. Evaluate F(\(b\)) - F(\(a\)) = \(\overset{\cdot}{[\text{F}\left(x\right)]}_{a}^{b}\), which is the value of \(\int_{a}^{\cdot}f(x)\ dx\). We now consider some examples

### Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution

In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method of substitution.

To evaluate \(\int\limits_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\), by substitution, the steps could be as follows:

1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, \(y=f(x)\) or \(x=g(y)\) to reduce the given integral to a known form.
2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning the constant of integration.
3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original variable.
4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:547]

**Solution** Let \(t=\tan\,^{-1}x\), then \(dt=\dfrac{1}{1+x^{2}}\,dx\). The new limits are, when \(x=0\), \(t=0\) and.

when \(x=1,\ t=\dfrac{\pi}{4}\). Thus, as \(x\) varies from \(0\) to \(\dfrac{1}{t}\) varies from \(0\) to \(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\).

Therefore \(\int_{0}^{1}\dfrac{\tan^{-1}x}{1+x^{2}}\,dx=\int_{0}^{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}t\,dt \left[\dfrac{t^{2}}{2}\right]_{0}^{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}=\dfrac{1}{2}\left[\dfrac{ \pi^{2}}{16}-0\right]=\dfrac{\pi^{2}}{32}\)

Evaluate the integrals in Exercises 1 to 8 using substitution.

Choose the correct answer in Exercises 9 and 10.

**9.** The value of the integral \(\int_{\dfrac{1}{3}}\dfrac{(x-x^{3})^{\dfrac{1}{3}}}{x^{4}}\,dx\) is

**10.** If \(f(x)=\int_{0}^{x}t\sin t\ dt\), then \(f(x)\) is

**(A) \(\cos x+x\,\sin x\) (B) \(x\,\sin x\) (D) \(\sin x+x\,\cos x\)

**7.10 Some Properties of Definite Integrals**

We list below some important properties of definite integrals. These will be useful in evaluating the definite integrals more easily.

**P\({}_{0}\):**\(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\ dt\)

**P\({}_{1}\):**\(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=-\int_{b}^{a}f(x)\,dx\). In particular, \(\int_{a}^{a}f(x)\,dx=0\)

**P\({}_{2}\):**\(\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=\int_{a}^{c}f(x)\,dx+\int_{c}^{b}f(x)\,dx\

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:549]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:550]

1. Now, if \(f\) is an even function, then \(f(-x)=f(x)\) and so (1) becomes \(\cdot\) \(\int_{-a}^{a}f(x)\,dx=\int_{0}^{a}f(x)\,dx+\int_{0}^{a}f(x)\,dx=2\int_{0}^{a}f(x )\,dx\)
2. If \(f\) is an odd function, then \(f(-x)=-f(x)\) and so (1) becomes \(\cdot\) \(\int_{-a}^{a}f(x)\,dx=-\int_{0}^{a}f(x)\,dx+\int_{0}^{a}f(x)\,dx=0\)

**Example 28** Evaluate \(\cdot\) \(\int_{-1}^{2}\Big{|}\ x^{3}-x\Big{|}\,dx\)

**Solution** We note that \(x^{3}-x\geq 0\) on \([-1,\,0]\) and \(x^{3}-x\leq 0\) on \([0,1]\) and that \(x^{3}-x\geq 0\) on \([1,\,2]\). So by \(\mathrm{P}_{2}\) we write

\[\cdot\] \[=\int_{-1}^{0}(x^{3}-x)\,dx+\int_{0}^{1}(x+x^{3})\,dx+\int_{1}^{2}(x^{3}- x)\,dx\] \[=\left[\frac{x^{4}}{4}-\frac{x^{2}}{2}\right]^{0}+\left[\frac{x^ {2}}{2}-\frac{x^{4}}{4}\right]^{1}+\left[\frac{x^{4}}{4}-\frac{x^{2}}{2} \right]^{2}_{1}\] \[=\left[\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\right]+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1 }{4}\right)+\left(4-2\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\] \[=-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}+2-\frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{2}=\frac{3}{2}-\frac{3}{4}+2=\frac{11}{4}\]

**Example 29** Evaluate \(\cdot\) \(\frac{\pi}{4}\sin^{2}x\,dx\)

**Solution** We observe that \(\sin^{2}x\) is an even function. Therefore, by \(\mathrm{P}_{7}\) (i), we get \(\cdot\) \(\int_{\frac{-\pi}{4}}^{\pi}\sin^{2}x\,dx\) \(=\) \(2\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\sin^{2}x\,dx\)

\[\cdot\] \[=\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:552]

**Example 32** Evaluate \(\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin^{4}x}{\sin^{4}x+\cos^{4}x}\ dx\)

**Solution** Let \(\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin^{4}x}{\sin^{4}x+\cos^{4}x}\ dx\)... (1)

Then, by \(\mathrm{P}_{4}\)

\[\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin^{4}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-x \right)}{\sin^{4}(\frac{\pi}{2}-x)+\cos^{4}(\frac{\pi}{2}-x)}\ dx=\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\cos^{4}x}{\cos^{4}x+\sin^{4}x}\ dx\]

... (2)

Adding (1) and (2), we get

\[2\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin^{4}x+\cos^{4}x}{\sin^{4} x+\cos^{4}x}\ dx=\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}dx=[x]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}=\frac{\pi}{2}\]

Hence

\[\mathrm{I}=\frac{\pi}{4}\]

**Example 33** Evaluate \(\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{6}}\frac{dx}{1+\sqrt{\tan x}}\)

**Solution** Let \(\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{6}}\frac{dx}{1+\sqrt{\tan x}}=\int\limits_ {\frac{\pi}{6}}\frac{\sqrt{\cos x}\ dx}{\sqrt{\cos x}+\sqrt{\sin x}}\)... (1)

Then, by \(\mathrm{P}_{3}\)

\[\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{6}}\frac{\sqrt{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}+ \frac{\pi}{6}-x\right)}\ dx}{\sqrt{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}+\frac{\pi}{6}-x \right)}+\sqrt{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}+\frac{\pi}{6}-x\right)}}\]

... (2)

Adding (1) and (2), we get

\[2\mathrm{I}=\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{3}}dx=\left[x\right]_{ \frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{3}}=\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{\pi}{6}\.\ \mathrm{Hence}\ \ \mathrm{I}=\frac{\pi}{12}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:554]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:556]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:557]

Putting (2) in (1), we get

\[\begin{array}{c}\cdot\\ \mbox{I}=x\log\,(\log x)-\frac{x}{\log x}-\int\frac{dx}{(\log x)^{2}}+\int\frac{ dx}{(\log x)^{2}}\ =\ x\log\,(\log x)-\frac{x}{\log x}+\mbox{C}\end{array}\]

**Example 39**: Find \(\int\left[\sqrt{\cot x}+\sqrt{\tan x}\,\right]dx\)

**Solution** We have

\[\mbox{I}=\int\left[\sqrt{\cot x}+\sqrt{\tan x}\,\right]dx\stackrel{{ \cdot}}{{=}}\int\sqrt{\tan x}\,(1+\cot x)\ dx\]

Put \(\tan x=t^{2}\), so that \(\sec^{2}x\ dx=2t\ dt\)

or

\[\begin{array}{c}dx=\ \frac{2t\ dt}{1+t^{4}}\\ \cdot\\ \mbox{I}=\ \int t\left(1+\frac{1}{t^{2}}\right)\frac{2t}{(1+t^{4})}\,dt\\ \cdot\\ \mbox{}=\ 2\int\ \frac{(t^{2}+1)}{t^{4}+1}\,dt=2\int\frac{(1+\frac{1}{t^{2} })\,dt}{\left(t^{2}+\frac{1}{t^{2}}\right)}=2\int\frac{(1+\frac{1}{t^{2}})\,dt }{\left(t-\frac{1}{t}\right)^{2}+2}\\ \cdot\\ \mbox{Put }t-\frac{1}{t}=y\mbox{, so that }\left(1+\frac{1}{t^{2}}\right)\ dt=dy\mbox{. Then}\\ \cdot\\ \mbox{I}=\ 2\int\frac{dy}{y^{2}+\left(\sqrt{2}\,\right)^{2}}=\sqrt{2}\ \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{\sqrt{2}}+\mbox{C}=\sqrt{2}\ \tan^{-1}\frac{ \left(t-\frac{1}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{2}}+\mbox{C}\end{array}\]

**Example 40**: Find \(\int\frac{\sin 2x\cos\ 2x\ dx}{\sqrt{9-\cos^{4}(2x)}}\)

**Solution** Let \(\mbox{I}=\int\frac{\sin\ 2x\cos\ 2x}{\sqrt{9-\cos^{4}2x}}\,dx\)Put \(\cos^{2}\) (\(2x\)) = \(t\) so that \(4\,\sin\,2x\,\cos\,2x\,\,dx\) = \(-\,dt\)

Therefore I = - \(\frac{1}{4}\int\!\frac{dt}{\sqrt{9-t^{2}}}\) = - \(\frac{1}{4}\sin^{-1}\!\left(\frac{t}{3}\right)\) + C = - \(\frac{1}{4}\sin^{-1}\!\left[\frac{1}{3}\cos^{2}2x\right]\) + C

**Example 41** Evaluate \(\int\!\frac{3}{-1}\!\left|\,x\sin\left(\pi\,x\right)\right|dx\)

**Solution** Here \(f(x)\) = \(\mid x\,\sin\,\pi x\mid\) = \(\begin{cases}x\,\sin\,x\,\text{for}\,-1\!\leq x\!\leq\!1\\ -x\sin\,x\,\text{for}\,1\!\leq x\leq\frac{3}{2}\end{cases}\)

Therefore \(\int\!\frac{3}{-1}\!\left|\,x\sin\pi\,x\,\right|dx\) = \(\int\!\frac{1}{-1}x\sin\pi\,x\,dx\) + \(\int\!\frac{3}{-1}\!-x\sin\pi\,x\,dx\)

Integrating both integrals on righthand side, we get

\[\int\!\frac{3}{-1}\!\left|\,x\sin\pi\,x\,\right|dx\] = \[\frac{2}{\pi}-\!\left[-\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\!\left|\,\pi\right| \right]\!=\!\frac{3}{\pi}+\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\]

* **First fundamental theorem of integral calculus** Let the area function be defined by \(\text{A}(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(x)\,dx\) for all \(x\geq a\), where the function \(f\) is assumed to be continuous on \([a,\,b]\). Then A\({}^{\prime}(x)=f(x)\) for all \(x\in[a,\,b]\).

This is called the definite integral of \(f\) over the range \([a,\,b]\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are called the limits of integration, \(a\) being the lower limit and \(b\) the upper limit.

In geometry, we have learnt formulae to calculate areas of various geometrical figures including triangles, rectangles, trapezias and circles. Such formulae are fundamental in the applications of mathematics to many real life problems. The formulae of elementary geometry allow us to calculate areas of many simple figures. However, they are inadequate for calculating the areas enclosed by curves. For that we shall need some concepts of Integral Calculus.

In the previous chapter, we have studied to find the area bounded by the curve \(y=f(x)\); the ordinates \(x=a\), \(x=b\) and \(x\)-axis, while calculating definite integral as the limit of a sum. Here, in this chapter, we shall study a specific application of integrals to find the area under simple curves, area between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and ellipses (standard forms only). We shall also deal with finding the area bounded by the above said curves.

### _Area under Simple Curves_

In the previous chapter, we have studied definite integral as the limit of a sum and how to evaluate definite integral using Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now, we consider the easy and intuitive way of finding the area bounded by the curve \(y=f(x)\), \(x\)-axis and the ordinates \(x=a\) and \(x=b\). From Fig 8.1, we can think of area under the curve as composed of large number of very thin vertical strips. Consider an arbitrary strip of height \(y\) and width \(dx\), then \(d\)A (area of the elementary strip)\(=ydx\), where, \(y=f(x)\).

This area is called the _elementary area_ which is located at an arbitrary position within the region which is specified by some value of \(x\) between \(a\) and \(b\). We can think of the total area A of the region between \(x\)-axis, ordinates \(x=a\), \(x=b\) and the curve \(y=f(x)\) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region PQRSP. Symbolically, we express

\[\text{A}=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{a}^{b}d\text{A}=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{a}^{b} ydx=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\]

The area A of the region bounded by the curve \(x=g\left(y\right)\), \(y\)-axis and the lines \(y=c\), \(y=d\) is given by

\[\text{A}=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{c}^{d}xdy=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{c}^{d}g(y)\,dy\]

Here, we consider horizontal strips as shown in the Fig 8.2

_Remark_ If the position of the curve under consideration is below the \(x\)-axis, then since \(f(x)<0\) from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\), as shown in Fig 8.3; the area bounded by the curve, \(x\)-axis and the ordinates \(x=a\), \(x=b\) come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical value of the area which is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we take its absolute value, i.e., \(\left|\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\right|\).

\[\text{A}=\overset{\cdot}{\int}_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\]

Generally, it may happen that some portion of the curve is above \(x\)-axis and some is below the \(x\)-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4. Here, \(\text{A}_{1}<0\) and \(\text{A}_{2}>0\). Therefore, the area A bounded by the curve \(y=f\left(x\right)\), \(x\)-axis and the ordinates \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) is given by \(\text{A}=\left|\text{A}_{1}\right|+\text{A}_{2}\).

**Fig 8.4**

**Example 1** Find the area enclosed by the circle \(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\).

**Solution** From Fig 8.5, the whole area enclosed by the given circle

\(=4\) (area of the region AOBA bounded by the curve, \(x\)-axis and the ordinates \(x=0\) and \(x=a\)) [as the circle is symmetrical about both \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis]

\(=4\!\int_{0}^{a}ydx\) (taking vertical strips)

\(=4\!\int_{0}^{a}\!\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}\ dx\)

Since \(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\) gives

\(y=\pm\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}\)

As the region AOBA lies in the first quadrant, \(y\) is taken as positive. Integrating, we get the whole area enclosed by the given circle

\(=4\!\left[\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}+\frac{a^{2}}{2}\sin^{-1}\frac{x}{a} \right]_{0}^{a}\)

\(=4\!\left[\left(\frac{a}{2}\times 0+\frac{a^{2}}{2}\sin^{-1}1\right)-0 \right]\)

\(=4\!\left[\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right)\!\right]\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:570]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:571]

**Solution** As shown in the Fig 8.9, the line \(y=3x+2\) meets \(x\)-axis at \(x=\frac{-2}{3}\) and its graph lies below \(x\)-axis for \(x\in\left(-1,\frac{-2}{3}\right)\) and above \(x\)-axis for \(x\in\left(\frac{-2}{3},1\right)\).

The required area = Area of the region ACBA + Area of the region ADEA

\[=\left|\int\frac{-2}{-1}(3x+2)dx\right|+\int\frac{1}{-2}(3x+2)dx\] \[=\left|\left[\frac{3x^{2}}{2}+2x\right]_{-1}^{-2}\right|+\left[ \frac{3x^{2}}{2}+2x\right]_{-2}^{1}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{25}{6}=\frac{13}{3}\]

**Example 4** Find the area bounded by the curve \(y=\cos x\) between \(x=0\) and \(x=2\pi\).

**Solution** From the Fig 8.10; the required area = area of the region OABO + area of the region BCDB + area of the region DEFD.

Thus, we have the required area

\[=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos xdx+\left|\int\frac{3\pi}{2}\cos x \,dx\right|+\int_{\frac{3\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}\cos xdx\] \[\cdot\] \[=\left[\sin x\right]_{0}^{2}+\left|\left[\sin x\right]_{\frac{3 \pi}{2}}^{2}\right|+\left[\sin x\right]_{\frac{3\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}\] \[=1+2+1=4\]

### Historical Note

The origin of the Integral Calculus goes back to the early period of development of Mathematics and it is related to the method of exhaustion developed by the mathematicians of ancient Greece. This method arose in the solution of problems on calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies etc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early methodof integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early period was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes (300 B.C.)

Systematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century. In 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory of fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at any point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function called the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents.

During 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the _Acta Eruditorum_ which he called _Calculas summatorius_, since it was connected with the summation of a number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol '\(\int\)'\({}_{\times}\)In 1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to Calculus integral. This corresponded to Newton's inverse method of tangents.

Both Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which was radically different. However, respective theories accomplished results that were practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is quite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative and the definite integral.

Conclusively, the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and primarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work of P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G. Leibnitz at the end of 17th century. However, this justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L. Cauchy in the early 19th century. Lastly, it is worth mentioning the following quotation by Lie Sophie's:

"It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which in their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the investigations of Kepler, Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis... The discovery that differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton and Leibnitz".

## 9 Introduction

In Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we discussed how to differentiate a given function \(f\) with respect to an independent variable, i.e., how to find \(f^{\prime}(x)\) for a given function \(f\) at each \(x\) in its domain of definition. Further, in the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find a function \(f\) whose derivative is the function \(g\), which may also be formulated as follows:

For a given function \(g\), find a function \(f\) such that

\[\frac{dy}{dx}\ =\ g(x),\,\text{where }y\ =f(x)\qquad\qquad... \tag{1}\]

An equation of the form (1) is known as a _differential equation_. A formal definition will be given later.

These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations.

In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation, general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and some applications of differential equations in different areas.

### Basic Concepts

We are already familiar with the equations of the type:

\[x^{2}-3x+3 =0... \tag{1}\] \[\sin\,x+\cos\,x =0...\] (2) \[x+y =7... \tag{3}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:576]

\[\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{\,2}}+y\ =0\]... (7) \[\cdot\] \[\left(\frac{d^{\,3}y}{dx^{\,3}}\right)+x^{\,2}\left(\frac{d^{\,2}y}{ dx^{\,2}}\right)^{\!\!3}=0\]... (8)

The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are \(1,2\) and \(3\) respectively.

#### 9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation

To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., \(y^{\prime},y^{\prime\prime},y^{\prime\prime\prime}\) etc. Consider the following differential equations:

\[\cdot\] \[\frac{d^{\,3}y}{dx^{\,3}}+2\!\left(\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{\,2}} \right)^{\!\!2}-\frac{dy}{dx}+y\ =0\]... (9) \[\cdot\] \[\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{\!\!2}+\!\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)- \sin^{\,2}y\ =0\]... (10) \[\cdot\] \[\cdot\] \[\cdot \tag{11}\]

We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in \(y^{\prime\prime},\ y^{\prime\prime}\) and \(y^{\prime}\), equation (10) is a polynomial equation in \(y^{\prime}\) (not a polynomial in \(y\) though). Degree of such differential equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in \(y^{\prime}\) and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.

By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation.

In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7), (8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of differential equation (11) is not defined.

[style=]

Note Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers.

**Example 1** Find the order and degree, if defined, of each of the following differential equations:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\cdot&\cdot&\frac{dy}{dx}-\cos x=0\\ \cdot&\cdot&y^{\prime\prime}+y^{2}+e^{y^{\prime}}=0\end{array}\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\text{(ii)}\;\;xy\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}+x\bigg{(}\frac{dy}{dx}\bigg{)}^{ 2}-y\frac{dy}{dx}=0\\ \cdot&y^{\prime\prime}+y^{2}+e^{y^{\prime}}=0\end{array}\]

**Solution**

1. The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is \(\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}\), so its order is one. It is a polynomial equation in \(y^{\prime}\) and the highest power raised to \(\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}\) is one, so its degree is one.
2. The highest order derivative present in the given differential equation is \(\cdot\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}\), so its order is two. It is a polynomial equation in \(\cdot\frac{dy}{dx^{2}}\) and the highest power raised to \(\cdot\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}\) is one, so its degree is one.
3. The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is \(\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}\), so its order is three. The given differential equation is not a polynomial equation in its derivatives and so its degree is not defined.

**Exercise 9.1**

Determine order and degree (if defined) of differential equations given in Exercises 1 to 10.

1. \(\frac{d^{\,4}y}{dx^{4}}+\sin(y^{\prime\prime})=0\) 2. \(y^{\prime}+5y=0\) 3. \(\cdot\bigg{(}\frac{ds}{dt}\bigg{)}^{4}+3s\,\frac{d^{\,2}s}{dt^{2}}=0\)

4. \(\bigg{(}\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}\bigg{)}^{2}+\cos\bigg{(}\frac{dy}{dx}\bigg{)}=0\) 5. \(\cdot\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}=\cos 3x+\sin 3x\)

6. \((y^{\prime\prime})^{2}+(y^{\prime\prime})^{3}+(y^{\prime})^{4}+y^{5}=0\) 7. \(y^{\prime\prime\prime}+2y^{\prime\prime}+y^{\prime}=0\)8. \(y^{\prime}+y=e^{x}\)9. \(y^{\prime\prime}+(y^{\prime})^{2}+2y=0\)10. \(y^{\prime\prime}+2y^{\prime}+\sin\,y=0\)11. The degree of the differential equation. \(\left(\frac{d^{2}\,y}{dx^{2}}\right)^{3}+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}+\sin \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)+1=0\) is (A) 3 (B) 2 (C) 1 (D) not defined
12. The order of the differential equation. \(2x^{2}\,\frac{d^{2}\,y}{dx^{2}}-3\,\frac{dy}{dx}+y=0\) is (A) 2 (B) 1 (C) 0 (D) not defined

### General and Particular Solutions of a Differential Equation

In earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type:

\[x^{2}+1=0\]... (1) \[\sin^{2}\,x-\cos\,x=0\]... (2)

Solution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the given equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown \(x\) in the given equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to the R.H.S..

Now consider the differential equation \(\frac{d^{2}\,y}{dx^{2}}+y=0\)... (3)

In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a function \(\phi\) that will satisfy it i.e., when the function \(\phi\) is substituted for the unknown \(y\) (dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S..

The curve \(y=\phi\) (\(x\)) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given differential equation. Consider the function given by

\[y=\phi\) (\(x\)) = \(a\,\sin\,(x+b\)),... (4)

where \(a\), \(b\in\,\mathbf{R}\). When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3), L.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).

Let \(a\) and \(b\) be given some particular values say \(a\) = 2 and \(b\) = \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), then we get a function \(y=\phi_{1}(x)=\) 2sin\(\left(x+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\)... (5)

When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again L.H.S. = R.H.S.. Therefore \(\phi_{1}\) is also a solution of equation (3).

Function \(\phi\) consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) \(a\), \(b\) and it is called _general solution_ of the given differential equation. Whereas function \(\phi_{{}_{1}}\) contains no arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) and hence is called a _particular solution_ of the given differential equation.

The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the _general solution_ (_primitive_) of the differential equation.

The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a _particular solution_ of the differential equation.

**Example 2**: Verify that the function \(y=e^{-3x}\) is a solution of the differential equation

\[\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}+\frac{dy}{dx}-6y=0\]

**Solution** Given function is \(y=e^{-3x}\). Differentiating both sides of equation with respect to \(x\), we get

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=-3e^{-3x}\]

... (1)

Now, differentiating (1) with respect to \(x\), we have

\[\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}=9\,e^{-3x}\]

Substituting the values of \(\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) and \(y\) in the given differential equation, we get

L.H.S. = 9 \(e^{-3x}+(-3e^{-3x})-6.e^{-3x}=9\,e^{-3x}-9\,e^{-3x}=0=\) R.H.S..

Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation.

**Example 3**: Verify that the function \(y=a\,\cos\,x+b\,\sin\,x\), where, \(a\), \(b\in\mathbf{R}\) is a solution of the differential equation \(\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}+y=0\)

**Solution** The given function is

\[y=a\,\cos\,x+b\,\sin\,x\]

... (1)

Differentiating both sides of equation (1) with respect to \(x\), successively, we get

\[\frac{dy}{dx}= -a\,\sin x+b\,\cos x\] \[\cdot\frac{d^{\,2}y}{dx^{2}}= -a\,\cos x-b\,\sin x\]Substituting the values of \(\dfrac{d^{\,2}\,y}{dx^{\,2}}\) and \(y\) in the given differential equation, we get L.H.S. = (\(-\,a\,\cos\,x-b\,\sin\,x\)) + (\(a\,\cos\,x+b\,\sin\,x\)) = 0 = R.H.S.

Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation.

EXERCISE 9.2

1. \(y=e^{x}+1\) : \(y^{\prime\prime}-y^{\prime}=0\)

3. \(y=\cos\,x+\mathrm{C}\) : \(y^{\prime}+\sin\,x=0\)
4. \(y=\sqrt{1+x^{\,2}}\) : \(y^{\prime}=\dfrac{xy}{1+x^{\,2}}\)
5. \(y=\mathrm{A}x\) : \(xy^{\prime}=y\) (\(x\neq 0\))
6. \(y=x\,\sin\,x\) : \(xy^{\prime}=y+x\,\sqrt{x^{\,2}-y^{\,2}}\) (\(x\neq 0\) and \(x>y\) or \(x<-y\))

10. \(y=\sqrt{a^{\,2}-x^{\,2}}\) \(x\in(a,\,a)\) : \(x+y\) \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=0\) (\(y\neq 0\))
11. The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of fourth order are: (A) 0 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4
12. The number of arbitrary constants in the particular solution of a differential equation of third order are: (A) 3 (B) 2 (C) 1 (D) 0

### Methods of Solving First Order, First Degree Differential Equations

In this section we shall discuss three methods of solving first order first degree differential equations.

#### 9.4.1 Differential equations with variables separable

A first order-first degree differential equation is of the form

\[\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\mathrm{F}(x,\,y)\qquad\qquad\qquad... \tag{1}\]If \(\mathrm{F}\left(x,y\right)\) can be expressed as a product \(\mathrm{g}\left(x\right)\)\(h(y)\), where, \(g(x)\) is a function of \(x\) and \(h(y)\) is a function of \(y\), then the differential equation (1) is said to be of variable separable type. The differential equation (1) then has the form

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=h\left(y\right)\,.\,\,g\left(x\right)\]... (2)

If \(h\left(y\right)\neq 0\), separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as

\[\frac{1}{h(y)}\,\,\,dy=g\left(x\right)\,\,dx\]... (3)

Integrating both sides of (3), we get

\[\int\frac{1}{h(y)}\,\,dy=\overset{\cdot}{\int}g\left(x\right)\,dx\]... (4)

Thus, (4) provides the solutions of given differential equation in the form

\[\mathrm{H}\left(y\right)=\mathrm{G}\left(x\right)+\mathrm{C}\]

Here, \(\mathrm{H}\left(y\right)\) and \(\mathrm{G}\left(x\right)\) are the anti derivatives of \(\frac{1}{h(y)}\) and \(g\left(x\right)\) respectively and \(\mathrm{C}\) is the arbitrary constant.

**Example 4**: Find the general solution of the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x+1}{2-y}\), \(\left(y\neq 2\right)\)

**Solution** We have

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x+1}{2-y}\]... (1)

Separating the variables in equation (1), we get

\[\left(2-y\right)\,\,dy=\left(x+1\right)\,\,dx\]... (2)

Integrating both sides of equation (2), we get

\[\int\left(2-y\right)\,dy=\overset{\cdot}{\int}\left(x+1\right)dx\]

or

\[2y-\frac{y^{2}}{2}=\frac{x^{2}}{2}+x+\mathrm{C}_{1}\]

or

\[x^{2}+y^{2}+2x-4y+2\,\,\mathrm{C}_{1}=0\]

or

\[x^{2}+y^{2}+2x-4y+\mathrm{C}=0\]

, where \(\mathrm{C}=2\mathrm{C}_{1}\)

which is the general solution of equation (1).

**Example 5** Find the general solution of the differential equation \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{1+y^{2}}{1+x^{2}}\).

**Solution** Since \(1+y^{2}\neq 0\), therefore separating the variables, the given differential equation can be written as

\[\dfrac{dy}{1+y^{2}} = \dfrac{dx}{1+x^{2}}\]... (1)

Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get

\[\int\dfrac{dy}{1+y^{2}} = \int\dfrac{dx}{1+x^{2}}\]

or

\[\tan^{-1}y = \tan^{-1}x+C\]

which is the general solution of equation (1).

**Example 6** Find the particular solution of the differential equation \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}=-4xy^{2}\) given that \(y=1\), when \(x=0\).

**Solution** If \(y\neq 0\), the given differential equation can be written as

\[\dfrac{dy}{y^{2}} = -4x\,dx\]... (1)

Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get

\[\dfrac{dy}{y^{2}} = -4\int x\,dx\]

or

\[\dfrac{dy}{y^{2}} = -2x^{2}+C\]

or

\[y = \dfrac{1}{2x^{2}-C}\]... (2)

Substituting \(y=1\) and \(x=0\) in equation (2), we get, C = - 1.

Now substituting the value of C in equation (2), we get the particular solution of the given differential equation as \(y=\dfrac{1}{2x^{2}+1}\).

#### 9.4.2 Homogeneous differential equations

Consider the following functions in \(x\) and \(y\)

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{1}}\left(x,\,y\right)=y^{2}+2xy,\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{2}}\left(x,\,y\right)\equiv 2x-3y,\)

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{3}}\left(x,\,y\right)=\cos\left(\dfrac{y}{x}\right),\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{4}}\left(x,\,y\right)=\sin x+\cos y\)

If we replace \(x\) and \(y\) by \(\lambda\bar{x}\) and \(\lambda y\) respectively in the above functions, for any nonzero constant \(\lambda\), we get

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{1}}\left(\lambda x,\,\lambda y\right)=\lambda^{2}\)\(\left(y^{2}+2xy\right)=\lambda^{2}\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{1}}\left(\bar{x},\,y\right)\)

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{2}}\left(\lambda x,\,\lambda y\right)=\lambda\)\(\left(2x-3y\right)=\lambda\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{2}}\left(x,\,y\right)\)

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{3}}\left(\lambda x,\,\lambda y\right)=\cos\left(\dfrac{\lambda \bar{x}y}{\lambda x}\right)=\cos\left(\dfrac{y}{x}\right)=\lambda^{0}\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{3}}\left(x,\,y\right)\)

\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{4}}\left(\lambda x,\,\lambda y\right)=\sin\lambda\bar{x}+\cos \,\lambda y\neq\lambda^{n}\)\(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{4}}\left(x,\,y\right)\), for any \(n\in\mathbf{N}\)

Here, we observe that the functions \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{1}}\), \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{2}}\), \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{3}}\) can be written in the form \(\mathrm{F}(\lambda x,\lambda y)=\lambda^{n}\mathrm{F}(x,y)\) but \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{4}}\) can not be written in this form. This leads to the following definition:

A function \(\mathrm{F}(x,\,y)\) is said to be _homogeneous function of degree \(n\)_ if

\(\mathrm{F}(\lambda x,\,\lambda y)=\lambda^{n}\)\(\mathrm{F}(x,\,y)\) for any nonzero constant \(\lambda\).

We note that in the above examples, \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{1}}\), \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{2}}\), \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{3}}\) are homogeneous functions of degree 2, 1, 0 respectively but \(\mathrm{F}_{{}_{4}}\) is not a homogeneous function.

\[\begin{array}{c}.\\ v+x\frac{dv}{dx}=g\left(v\right)\\.\\.\end{array}\]

or

\[x\frac{dv}{dx}=g\left(v\right)-v\]

... (4)

Separating the variables in equation (4), we get

\[\begin{array}{c}.\\ \frac{dv}{g\left(v\right)-v}=\frac{dx}{x}\\.\\.\end{array}\]

Integrating both sides of equation (5), we get

\[\begin{array}{c}.\\ \int\frac{dv}{g\left(v\right)-v}=\int\frac{1}{x}dx+C\\.\end{array}\]

Equation (6) gives general solution (primitive) of the differential equation (1) when we replace \(v\) by \(\frac{\overset{\cdot}{y}}{x}\).

NoteIf the homogeneous differential equation is in the form \(\frac{dx}{dy}=\mathrm{F}(x,y)\) where, \(\mathrm{F}\left(x,y\right)\) is homogenous function of degree zero, then we make substitution \(\frac{x}{y}=v\) i.e., \(x=vy\) and we proceed further to find the general solution as discussed above by writing \(\frac{dx}{dy}=\mathrm{F}(x,y)=h\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\).

Let

\[\mathrm{F}\left(\lambda x,\,\lambda y\right)=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\lambda} \left(x+2y\right)}{\lambda\left(x-y\right)}=\lambda^{0}\cdot f\left(x,y\right)\]

Replacing \(v\) by \(\frac{y}{x}\), we get

which is the general solution of the differential equation (1)

* A differential equation of the form \(\dfrac{dy}{dx}+\mathrm{Py}=\mathrm{Q}\), where \(\mathrm{P}\) and \(\mathrm{Q}\) are constants or functions of \(x\) only is called a first order linear differential equation.

### Historical Note

One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations. Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November, 11,1675, when Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black and white the identity \(\int y\ dy=\dfrac{1}{2}\,y^{2}\), thereby introducing both the symbols \(\int\) and \(dy\).

Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents were prescribed. This led him to discover the '_method of separation of variables_' 1691. A year later he formulated the '_method of solving the homogeneousdifferential equations of the first order_'. He went further in a very short time to the discovery of the '_method of solving a linear differential equation of the first-order_'. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!

In the old days, what we now call the'solution' of a differential equation, was used to be referred to as 'integral' of the differential equation, the word being coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word'solution was first used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare (1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word'solution' and thus the word'solution' has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of the '_method of separation of variables_' is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748), a younger brother of James Bernoulli.

Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations. In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the differential equation

\[x^{2}\ y^{\prime\prime}=2y,\]

which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of differential equations, under the heading '_qualitative analysis of differential equations_'. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely necessary in almost all investigations.

### Introduction

In our day to day life, we come across many queries such as - What is your height? How should a football player hit the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters, a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which is a real number. Such quantities are called _scalars_. However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and direction (in which another player is positioned). Such quantities are called _vectors_. In mathematics, physics and engineering, we frequently come across with both types of quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass, time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work, money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.

In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors, and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.

### Some Basic Concepts

Let '\(l\)' be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed is called a _directed line_ (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).

Now observe that if we restrict the line \(l\) to the line segment AB, then a magnitude is prescribed on the line \(l\) with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a _directed line segment_ (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as direction.

**Definition 1** A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.

Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) or simply as \(\vec{a}\), and read as'vector \(\overline{\text{AB}}\)' or'vector \(\vec{a}\)'.

The point A from where the vector AB starts is called its _initial point_, and the point B where it ends is called its _terminal point_. The distance between initial and terminal points of a vector is called the _magnitude_ (or length) of the vector, denoted as \(\overline{\text{ABl}}\), or \(\vec{l}\vec{a}\), or \(a\). The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

**Position Vector**

From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system (Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates \((x,y,z)\) with respect to the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector \(\overline{\text{OP}}\) having O and P as its initial and terminal points, respectively, is called the \(position\ vector\) of the point P with respect to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of \(\overline{\text{OP}}\) (or \(\vec{r}\)) is given by

\[|\overline{\text{OP}}|\!=\!\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}\]

In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O are denoted by \(\vec{a},\ \vec{b},\ \vec{c}\), etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

**Direction Cosines**

Consider the position vector \(\overline{\mathrm{OP}}\left(\mathrm{or}\ \vec{r}\ \right)\) of a point \(\mathrm{P}(x,y,z)\) as in Fig 10.3. The angles \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\) made by the vector \(\vec{r}\) with the positive directions of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axes respectively, are called its _direction angles_. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., \(\cos\alpha\), \(\cos\beta\) and \(\cos\gamma\) are called _direction cosines_ of the vector \(\vec{r}\), and usually denoted by \(l\), \(m\) and \(n\), respectively.

**Fig 10.3**

From Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we have \(\cos\alpha=\dfrac{x}{r}\ \left(r\ \mathrm{stands}\ \mathrm{for}\ |\vec{r}\ |\right)\). Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and OCP, we may write \(\cos\ \beta=\dfrac{y}{r}\ \mathrm{and}\ \cos\gamma=\dfrac{z}{r}\ \mathrm{.}\) Thus, the coordinates of the point \(\mathrm{P}\) may also be expressed as \(\left(lr,mr,nr\right)\). The numbers \(lr,mr\) and \(nr\), proportional to the direction cosines are called as _direction ratios_ of vector \(\vec{r}\), and denoted as \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\), respectively.

**Note**: One may note that \(l^{2}+m^{2}+n^{2}=1\) but \(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\neq 1\), in general.

### Types of Vectors

**Zero Vector** A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector (or null vector), and denoted as \(\vec{0}\). Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any direction. The vectors \(\overline{\text{AA}}\), \(\overline{\text{BB}}\) represent the zero vector,

**Unit Vector** A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The unit vector in the direction of a given vector \(\vec{a}\) is denoted by \(\hat{a}\).

**Coinitial Vectors** Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial vectors.

**Collinear Vectors** Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.

**Equal Vectors** Two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are said to be equal, if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written as \(\vec{a}=\vec{b}\).

**Negative of a Vector** A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector (say, \(\overline{\text{AB}}\)), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called _negative_ of the given vector. For example, vector \(\overline{\text{BA}}\) is negative of the vector \(\overline{\text{AB}}\), and written as \(\overline{\text{BA}}\) = - \(\overline{\text{AB}}\).

_Remark_ The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are called _free vectors_. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.

**Example 1**: Represent graphically a displacement of 40 km, 30\({}^{\circ}\) west of south.

### 10.4 Addition of Vectors

A vector \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) simply means the displacement from a point A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl moves from A to B and then from B to C (Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from point A to the point C, is given by the vector \(\overline{\text{AC}}\) and expressed as

\[\overline{\text{AC}}=\overline{\text{AB}}+\overline{\text{BC}}\]

This is known as the _triangle law of vector addition._

In general, if we have two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other (Fig 10.8(ii)).

**Fig 10.8**

For example, in Fig 10.8(ii), we have shifted vector \(\vec{b}\) without changing its magnitude and direction, so that it's initial point coincides with the terminal point of \(\vec{a}\). Then, the vector \(\vec{a}\) + \(\vec{b}\), represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or resultant) of the vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have

\[\overline{\text{AB}}+\overline{\text{BC}}=\overline{\text{AC}}\]

Now again, since \(\overline{\text{AC}}=-\overline{\text{CA}}\), from the above equation, we have

\[\overline{\text{AB}}+\overline{\text{BC}}+\overline{\text{CA}}=\overline{ \text{AA}}=\vec{0}\]

This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).

Now, construct a vector \(\overline{\mathrm{BC}}^{\prime}\) so that its magnitude is same as the vector \(\overline{\mathrm{BC}}\), but the direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii)), i.e.,

\[\overline{\mathrm{BC}^{\prime}}=-\overline{\mathrm{BC}}\]

Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have

\[\overline{\mathrm{AC}^{\prime}}=\overline{\mathrm{AB}}+\overline{\mathrm{BC}^{ \prime}}=\overline{\mathrm{AB}}+(-\overline{\mathrm{BC}})=\vec{a}-\vec{b}\]

The vector \(\overline{\mathrm{AC}^{\prime}}\) is said to represent the _difference of_\(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\).

Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity vectors-one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise idea about the effective speed and direction (i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have the following law of vector addition.

If we have two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) represented by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their sum \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram through their common point. This is known as the _parallelogram law of vector addition._

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\) & From Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that \\ \(\overline{\mathrm{OA}}\) & \(+\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\) & \(=\overline{\mathrm{OC}}\) \\ or & \(\overline{\mathrm{OA}}\) & \(+\overline{\mathrm{OB}}\) & (since \(\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\) & \(=\overline{\mathrm{OB}}\) ) \\ \end{tabular}

which is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector addition are equivalent to each other.

**Properties of vector addition**

**Property 1**: For any two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\),

\[\vec{a}+\vec{b}=\vec{b}+\vec{a}\] (Commutative property)

**Proof** Consider the parallelogram ABCD (Fig 10.10). Let \(\overline{\text{AB}}=\bar{a}\) and \(\overline{\text{BC}}=\bar{b}\), then using the triangle law, from triangle ABC, we have

\[\overline{\text{AC}}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}\]

Now, since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel, from Fig 10.10, we have, \(\overline{\text{AD}}=\overline{\text{BC}}=\bar{b}\) and \(\overline{\text{DC}}=\overline{\text{AB}}=\bar{a}\). Again using triangle law, from triangle ADC, we have

\[\overline{\text{AC}}=\overline{\text{AD}}+\overline{\text{DC}}=\bar{b}+\bar{a}\]

Hence \(\bar{a}+\bar{b}=\bar{b}+\bar{a}\)

**Property** **2** For any three vectors \(a,b\) and \(\bar{c}\)

\[(\bar{a}+\bar{b})+\bar{c}=\bar{a}+(\bar{b}+\bar{c})\]

**Proof** Let the vectors \(\bar{a},\bar{b}\) and \(\bar{c}\) be represented by \(\overline{\text{PQ}}\), \(\overline{\text{QR}}\) and \(\overline{\text{RS}}\), respectively, as shown in Fig 10.11(i) and (ii).

**Fig 10.11**

Then \(\bar{a}+\bar{b}=\overline{\text{PQ}}+\overline{\text{QR}}=\overline{\text{ PR}}\)

and \(\bar{b}+\bar{c}=\overline{\text{QR}}+\overline{\text{RS}}=\overline{\text{QS}}\)

So \((\bar{a}+\bar{b})+\bar{c}=\overline{\text{PR}}+\overline{\text{RS}}=\overline {\text{PS}}\)\[\vec{a}+(\vec{b}+\vec{c})=\overline{\mathrm{PQ}}+\overline{\mathrm{QS}}=\overline{ \mathrm{PS}}\]

Hence

\[(\vec{a}+\vec{b})+\vec{c}=\vec{a}+(\vec{b}+\vec{c})\]

_Remark_ The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of three vectors \(\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}\) as \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}+\vec{c}\) without using brackets.

Note that for any vector \(\dot{\vec{a}}\), we have

\[\vec{a}+\vec{0}=\vec{0}+\vec{a}=\vec{a}\]

Here, the zero vector \(\vec{0}\) is called the _additive identity_ for the vector addition.

### Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar

Let \(\vec{a}\) be a given vector and \(\lambda\) a scalar. Then the product of the vector \(\vec{a}\) by the scalar \(\lambda\), denoted as \(\lambda\vec{a}\), is called the multiplication of vector \(\vec{a}\) by the scalar \(\lambda\). Note that, \(\lambda\vec{a}\) is also a vector, collinear to the vector \(\vec{a}\). The vector \(\lambda\vec{a}\) has the direction same (or opposite) to that of vector \(\vec{a}\) according as the value of \(\lambda\) is positive (or negative). Also, the magnitude of vector \(\lambda\vec{a}\) is \(\lambda\lambda\) times the magnitude of the vector \(\vec{a}\), i.e.,

\[|\lambda\vec{a}|=|\lambda||\vec{a}|\]

A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given in Fig 10.12.

**Fig 10.12**

When \(\lambda=-1\), then \(\lambda\vec{a}=\vec{a}\), which is a vector having magnitude equal to the magnitude of \(\vec{a}\) and direction opposite to that of the direction of \(\vec{a}\). The vector \(-\vec{a}\) is called the _negative_ (or _additive inverse_) _of vector \(\vec{a}\)_ and we always have

\[\vec{a}+(-\vec{a})=(-\vec{a})+\vec{a}=\vec{0}\]

Also, if \(\lambda=\frac{1}{|\,a|}\), provided \(\vec{a}\neq 0\) i.e. \(\vec{a}\) is not a null vector, then

\[|\lambda\vec{a}|=|\lambda||\vec{a}|=\frac{1}{|\,\vec{a}\,|}\,|\vec{a}|=1\]So, \(\lambda\)\(\bar{a}\) _represents the unit vector in the direction of \(\bar{a}\)_. We write it as

\[\dot{\bar{a}}=\frac{1}{|\,\bar{a}\,|}\bar{a}\]

Note For any scalar \(k\), \(k\bar{0}=\bar{0}\).

#### 10.5.1 Components of a vector

Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the \(x\)-axis, \(y\)-axis and \(z\)-axis, respectively. Then, clearly

\[|\overline{\rm OA}|=1,|\overline{\rm OB}|=1\ {\rm and}\ |\overline{\rm OC}|=1\]

The vectors \(\overline{\rm OA}\), \(\overline{\rm OB}\) and \(\overline{\rm OC}\), each having magnitude 1, are called _unit vectors along the axes_ OX, OY and OZ, respectively, and denoted by \(\dot{\bar{i}},\,\hat{j}\) and \(\hat{k}\), respectively (Fig 10.13).

Now, consider the position vector OP of a point P(\(x,y,z\)) as in Fig 10.14. Let P\({}_{1}\) be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY.

We, thus, see that P\({}_{1}\)P is parallel to \(z\)-axis. As \(\dot{\bar{i}},\,\hat{j}\) and \(\hat{k}\)  are the unit vectors along the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have \(\overline{\rm P_{i}P}=\overline{\rm OR}=z\hat{k}\). Similarly, \(\overline{\rm QP_{1}}=\overline{\rm OS}=\hat{y\hat{j}}\) and \(\overline{\rm OQ}=x\hat{i}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:623]

The addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar together give the following distributive laws:

Let \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) be any two vectors, and \(k\) and \(m\) be any scalars. Then

1. \(k\vec{a}+m\vec{a}=(k+m)\vec{a}\)
2. \(k(m\vec{a})=(km)\vec{a}\)
3. \(k(\vec{a}+\vec{b})=k\vec{a}+k\vec{b}\)

_Remarks_

1. One may observe that whatever be the value of \(\lambda\), the vector \(\lambda\vec{a}\) is always collinear to the vector \(\vec{a}\). In fact, two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are collinear if and only if there exists a nonzero scalar \(\lambda\) such that \(\vec{b}=\lambda\vec{a}\). If the vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are given in the component form, i.e. \(\vec{a}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{1}\hat{i}}+a_{2}\hat{j}+a_{3}\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=b_{1}\hat{i}+b_{2}\hat{j}+b_{3}\hat{k}_{s}\) then the two vectors are collinear if and only if \[\overset{\cdot}{b_{1}\hat{i}}+b_{2}\hat{j}+b_{3}\hat{k} =\overset{\cdot}{\lambda(a_{1}\hat{i}+a_{2}\hat{j}+a_{3}\hat{k})}\] \[\Leftrightarrow\] \[\Leftrightarrow\] \[\Leftrightarrow\] \[\overset{\cdot}{b_{1}}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{2}}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{3}}= \overset{\cdot}{\lambda}\]
2. If \(\vec{a}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{1}\hat{i}}+a_{2}\hat{j}+\overset{\cdot}{a_{3}}\hat{k}\), then \(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\),\(a_{3}\) are also called direction ratios of \(\vec{a}\).
3. In case if it is given that \(l_{1}\underline{m}\underline{n}\underline{n}\) are direction cosines of a vector, then \(\overset{\cdot}{l\hat{i}}+m\hat{j}+n\hat{k}\) = \((\cos\alpha)\hat{i}+(\cos\beta)\hat{j}+(\cos\gamma)\hat{k}\) is the unit vector in the direction of that vector, where \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\hat{\gamma}\) are the angles which the vector makes with \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) axes respectively.

**Example 4**: Find the values of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) so that the vectors \(\vec{a}=x\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+z\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=2\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+\overset{\cdot}{k\hat{k}}\) are equal.

**Solution** Note that two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal. Thus, the given vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) will be equal if and only if

\(x=2\), \(y=2\), \(z=1\)

**Example 5** Let \(\vec{a}=\hat{i}+2\hat{j}\) and \(\,\vec{b}=2\hat{i}+\hat{j}\). Is \(\mid\vec{a}\mid=\mid\vec{b}\mid\)? Are the vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) equal?

**Solution** We have \(\mid\vec{a}\mid=\sqrt{1^{2}+2^{2}}=\sqrt{5}\) and \(\mid\vec{b}\mid=\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\sqrt{5}\)

So, \(\mid\vec{a}\mid=\mid\vec{b}\mid\). But, the two vectors are not equal since their corresponding components are distinct.

**Example 6** Find unit vector in the direction of vector \(\vec{a}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+\hat{k}\)

**Solution** The unit vector in the direction of a vector \(\vec{a}\) is given by \(\hat{a}=\frac{1}{\mid\vec{a}\mid}\vec{a}\).

Now

\(\mid\vec{a}\mid=\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}+1^{2}}=\sqrt{14}\)

Therefore

\(\hat{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}(2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+\hat{k})\)

**Example 7** Find a vector in the direction of vector \(\vec{a}=\hat{i}-2\hat{j}\) that has magnitude 7 units.

**Solution** The unit vector in the direction of the given vector \(\vec{a}\) is

\(\hat{a}=\frac{1}{\mid\vec{a}\mid}\vec{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}(\hat{i}-2\hat{j})= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\hat{i}-\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\ \hat{j}\)

Therefore, the vector having magnitude equal to 7 and in the direction of \(\vec{a}\) is

\(\hat{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\hat{i}-\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\hat{j}\)

**Example 8** Find the unit vector in the direction of the sum of the vectors, \(\vec{a}=2\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-5\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=2\hat{i}+\hat{j}+3\hat{k}\).

**Solution** The sum of the given vectors is

\(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) (= \(\vec{c}\), say) = \(4\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-2\hat{k}\)

and

\(\mid\vec{c}\mid=\sqrt{4^{2}+3^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\sqrt{29}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:626]

**Example 10** Find the vector joining the points P(2, 3, 0) and Q(\(-\) 1, \(-\) 2, \(-\) 4) directed from P to Q.

**Solution** Since the vector is to be directed from P to Q, clearly P is the initial point and Q is the terminal point. So, the required vector joining P and Q is the vector \(\overline{\text{PQ}}\), given by

\[\overline{\text{PQ}} =\overset{\cdot}{(-1-2)\hat{t}}+(-2-3)\hat{j}+(-4-0)\hat{k}\] \[\overline{\text{PQ}} =-3\hat{t}-5\hat{j}-4\hat{k}.\]

#### 10.5.3 Section formula

Let P and Q be two points represented by the position vectors \(\overline{\text{OP}}\) and \(\overline{\text{OQ}}\), respectively, with respect to the origin O. Then the line segment joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third point, say R, in two ways - internally (Fig 10,16) and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find the position vector \(\overline{\text{OR}}\) for the point R with respect to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one.

**Case**: I When R divides PQ internally. (Fig 10.16).

If R divides \(\overline{\text{PQ}}\) such that \(m\)\(\overline{\text{RQ}}=n\)\(\overline{\text{PR}}\),

where \(m\) and \(n\) are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides \(\overline{\text{PQ}}\) internally in the ratio of \(m:n\). Now from triangles ORQ and OPR, we have

\[\overline{\text{RQ}}=\text{OQ}-\overline{\text{OR}}=\overset{\cdot}{b}- \overset{\cdot}{r}\]

and

\[\overline{\text{PR}}=\overline{\text{OR}}-\overline{\text{OP}}=\overset{\cdot }{r}-\overset{\cdot}{a},\]

Therefore, we have

\[m\left(\overset{\cdot}{b}-\overset{\cdot}{r}\right)=n\left(\overset{\cdot}{r} -\overset{\cdot}{a}\right)\quad\text{(Why?)}\]

or

\[\overset{\cdot}{r}=\frac{m\overset{\cdot}{b}+n\overset{\cdot}{a}}{m+n}\] (on simplification)

Hence, the position vector of the point R which divides P and Q internally in the ratio of \(m:n\) is given by

\[\overline{\text{OR}}=\frac{m\overset{\cdot}{b}+n\overset{\cdot}{a}}{m+n}\]

**Case II** When R divides PQ externally (Fig 10.17). We leave it to the reader as an exercise to verify that the position vector of the point R which divides the line segment PQ externally in the ratio.

\(m:n\) i.e. \(\frac{\text{PR}}{\text{QR}}=\frac{m}{n}\) is given by

\(\overline{\text{OR}}=\frac{m\vec{b}-n\vec{a}}{m-n}\)

**Fig 10.17**

**Remark** If R is the midpoint of PQ, then \(m=n\). And therefore, from Case I, the midpoint R of \(\overline{\text{PQ}}\), will have its position vector as

\(\overline{\text{OR}}=\frac{\vec{a}+\vec{b}}{2}\)

**Example 11** Consider two points P and Q with position vectors \(\overline{\text{OP}}=3\vec{a}-2\vec{b}\) and \(\overline{\text{OQ}}=\vec{a}+\vec{b}\). Find the position vector of a point R which divides the line joining P and Q in the ratio 2:1, (i) internally, and (ii) externally.

**Solution**

(i) The position vector of the point R dividing the join of P and Q internally in the ratio 2:1 is

\(\overline{\text{OR}}=\frac{2(\vec{a}+\vec{b})+(3\vec{a}-2\vec{b})}{2+1}=\frac {5\vec{a}}{3}\)

(ii) The position vector of the point R dividing the join of P and Q externally in the ratio 2:1 is

\(\overline{\text{OR}}=\frac{2(\vec{a}+\vec{b})\!=\!(3\vec{a}-2\vec{b})}{2-1}=4 \vec{b}-\vec{a}\)

**Example 12** Show that the points \(\text{A}(2\hat{i}-\hat{j}+\hat{k})\), \(\text{B}(\hat{i}-3\hat{j}-5\hat{k})\), \(\text{C}(3\hat{i}-4\hat{j}-4\hat{k})\) are the vertices of a right angled triangle.

**Solution** We have

\(\overline{\text{AB}}=\)\((1-2)\hat{i}+(-3+1)\hat{j}+(-5-1)\hat{k}\)\(=\)\(-\hat{i}-2\hat{j}-6\hat{k}\)

\(\overline{\text{BC}}=\)\((3-1)\hat{i}+(-4+3)\hat{j}+(-4+5)\hat{k}\)\(=\)\(2\hat{i}-\hat{j}+\hat{k}\)

and

\(\overline{\text{CA}}=\)\((2-3)\hat{i}+(-1+4)\hat{j}+(1+4)\hat{k}\)\(=\)\(-\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+5\hat{k}\)Further, note that

\[\big{|}\,\overline{\mathrm{AB}}\,\big{|}^{2}=41=6+35=\big{|}\overline{\mathrm{BC}} \,\big{|}^{2}+\big{|}\,\overline{\mathrm{CA}}\,\big{|}^{2}\]

Hence, the triangle is a right angled triangle.

### Product of Two Vectors

So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely, multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly, multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot) product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section, we will discuss these two types of products.

#### Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors

**Definition 2** The scalar product of two nonzero vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), denoted by \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\), is defined as \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|\left|\,\vec{b}\,\right|\cos\theta\), where, \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), \(0\leq\theta\leq\pi\) (Fig 10.19). If either \(\vec{a}=0\) or \(\vec{b}=0\) then \(\theta\) is not defined, and in this case, we define \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=0\)

**Observations**

1. \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\) is a real number.
2. Let \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) be two nonzero vectors, then \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=0\) if and only if \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are perpendicular to each other. i.e. \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=0\Leftrightarrow\vec{a}\perp\vec{b}\)
3. If \(\theta=0\), then \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|\left|\,\vec{b}\,\right|\) In particular, \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{a}=\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|^{2}\), as \(\theta\) in this case is \(0\).
4. If \(\theta=\pi\), then \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=-\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|\left|\,\vec{b}\,\right|\) In particular, \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=-\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|\left|\,\vec{b}\,\right|\), as \(\theta\) in this case is \(n\).
5. In view of the Observations 2 and 3, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors \(\hat{\vec{i}}\), \(\hat{\vec{j}}\) and \(\hat{k}\), we have \(\hat{\vec{i}}\), \(\hat{\vec{j}}\) and \(\hat{k}\), we have \(\hat{\vec{i}}\), \(\hat{\vec{j}}=\hat{\vec{j}}\cdot\hat{\vec{k}}=\hat{k}\cdot\hat{\vec{i}}=0\)
6. The angle between two nonzero vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) is given by \(\cos\theta=\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}}{\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right|\left|\,\vec{b} \,\right|}\), or \(\theta=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}}{\left|\,\vec{a}\,\right| \left|\,\vec{b}\,\right|}\right)\)
7. The scalar product is commutative. i.e. \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=\vec{b}\cdot\vec{a}\) (Why?)

**Two important properties of scalar product**

Property 1 (Distributivity of scalar product over addition) Let \(\vec{a}\), \(\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{c}\) be any three vectors, then

\[\vec{a}\cdot(\vec{b}+\vec{c})=\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\ +\ \vec{a}\cdot\vec{c}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:632]

is called the _projection vector_, and its magnitude \(|\vec{p}|\) is simply called as the _projection_ of the vector \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) on the directed line \(l\).

For example, in each of the following figures (Fig 10.20 (i) to (iv)), projection vector of \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) along the line \(l\) is vector \(\overline{\text{AC}}\).

**Observations**

1. If \(\hat{\rho}\) is the unit vector along a line \(l\), then the projection of a vector \(\vec{a}\) on the line \(l\) is given by \(\vec{a}\cdot\hat{p}\).
2. Projection of a vector \(\vec{a}\) on other vector \(\vec{b}\), is given by \[\vec{a}\cdot\hat{b},\quad\text{or}\quad\vec{a}\cdot\left(\frac{\vec{b}}{|\vec{ b}\,|}\right),\;\text{ or}\;\;\frac{1}{|\vec{b}\,|}(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b})\]
3. If \(\theta\) = 0, then the projection vector of \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) will be \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) itself and if \(\theta\) = \(\pi\), then the projection vector of \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) will be \(\overline{\text{BA}}\)..
4. If \(\theta\) = \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\theta\) = \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), then the projection vector of \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) will be zero vector.

_Remark_ If \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) are the direction angles of vector \(\vec{a}\) = \(a_{i}\hat{i}+a_{2}\hat{j}+a_{3}\hat{k}\), then its direction cosines may be given as

\[\cos\alpha\]

\[\frac{\alpha\cdot\hat{i}}{|\vec{a}\,|\vec{i}\,|}=\frac{a_{1}}{|\vec{a}\,|}, \cos\beta\equiv\frac{a_{2}}{|\vec{a}\,|},\;\text{ and}\;\;\cos\gamma=\frac{a_{3}}{|\vec{a}\,|}\]

Also, note that \(|\vec{a}\,|\cos\alpha\), \(|\vec{a}|\cos\beta\) and \(|\vec{a}|\cos\gamma\) are respectively the projections of \(\vec{a}\) along OX, OY and OZ. i.e., the scalar components \(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\) and \(a_{3}\) of the vector \(\vec{a}\), are precisely the projections of \(\vec{a}\) along \(x\)-axis, \(y\)-axis and \(z\)-axis, respectively. Further, if \(\vec{a}\) is a unit vector, then it may be expressed in terms of its direction cosines as

\[\vec{a}=\cos\alpha\vec{i}+\cos\beta\hat{j}+\cos\gamma\hat{k}\]

**Example 13**: Find the angle between two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) with magnitudes 1 and 2 respectively and when \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\) =1.

**Solution** Given \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\) = 1, \(|\vec{a}\,|\) = 1 and \(|\vec{b}\,|\) = 2. We have

\[\theta=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}}{|\vec{a}\,|\vec{b}\,|}\right) =\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\pi}{3}\]

**Example 14**: Find angle '\(\theta\)' between the vectors \(\vec{a}=\hat{i}+\hat{j}-\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=\hat{i}-\hat{j}+\hat{k}\).

**Solution** The angle \(\theta\) between two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) is given by

\[\cos\theta =\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}}{\left|\vec{a}\left\|\vec{b}\right.\right|}\] Now \[\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} =\begin{array}{c}(\hat{i}+\hat{j}-\hat{k})\cdot(\hat{i}-\hat{j}+ \hat{k})=1-1-1=-1\,.\end{array}\] Therefore, we have \[\cos\theta =\frac{-1}{3}\] hence the required angle is \[\theta =\ \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)\]

**Example 15**: If \(\vec{a}=5\hat{i}-\hat{j}-3\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-5\hat{k}\), then show that the vectors \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}\) are perpendicular.

**Solution** We know that two nonzero vectors are perpendicular if their scalar product is zero.

Here \[\vec{a}+\vec{b} =\begin{array}{c}(5\hat{i}-\hat{j}-3\hat{k})+(\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-5 \hat{k})=6\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-8\hat{k}\\ \text{and} \vec{a}-\vec{b} =\begin{array}{c}(5\hat{i}-\hat{j}-3\hat{k})=(\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-5 \hat{k})=4\hat{i}-4\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\end{array}\] So \[(\vec{a}+\vec{b})\cdot(\vec{a}-\vec{b})=(6\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-8\hat{k})\cdot(4 \hat{i}-4\hat{j}+2\hat{k})=24-8-16=0.\] Hence \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a}=\vec{b}\) are perpendicular vectors.

**Example 16**: Find the projection of the vector \(\vec{a}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\) on the vector \(\vec{b}=\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+\hat{k}\).

**Solution** The projection of vector \(\vec{a}\) on the vector \(\vec{b}\) is given by

\[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\left|\vec{b}\right.}(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}) =\frac{\left(2\times 1+3\times 2+2\times 1\right)}{\sqrt{\left(1\right) ^{2}+\left(2\right)^{2}+\left(1\right)^{2}}}=\frac{10}{\sqrt{6}}=\frac{5}{3} \sqrt{6}\end{array}\]

**Example 17**: Find \(\left|\vec{a}-\vec{b}\right|\), if two vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are such that \(\left|\vec{a}\right.\left|=2\right.\), \(\left|\vec{b}\right.\left|=3\right.\) and \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=4\).

**Solution** We have

\[\left|\vec{a}-\vec{b}\right.\left|^{2}=(\vec{a}-\vec{b})\cdot(\vec{a}-\vec{b})\right.\]

\[=\ \vec{a}.\vec{a}-\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}-\vec{b}\cdot\vec{a}+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{b}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:635]

Hence

\[|\,\bar{a}+\bar{b}\ |\leq\,|\,\bar{a}\ |+|\,\bar{b}\ |\]

_Remark_ If the equality holds in triangle inequality (in the above Example 20), i.e.

\[|\,\bar{a}+\bar{b}\ |\ =\ \ |\,\bar{a}\ |+|\,\bar{b}\ |\,\]

then

\[|\,\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\,|\ =\ |\,\overline{\mathrm{AB}}\,|+|\,\overline{ \mathrm{BC}}\,|\]

showing that the points \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) are collinear.

**Example 21** Show that the points \(\mathrm{A}\,(-2\hat{i}+3\,\hat{j}+5\hat{k})\), \(\mathrm{B}(\ \hat{i}+2\,\hat{j}+3\hat{k})\) and \(\mathrm{C}(7\hat{i}-\hat{k})\) are collinear.

**Solution** We have

\[\overline{\mathrm{AB}}\ =(1+2)\,\hat{i}+(2-3)\,\hat{j}+(3-5)\,\hat{k}=3\hat{i}- \hat{j}-2\hat{k}\,\]

\[\overline{\mathrm{BC}}\ =(7-1)\,\hat{i}+(0-2)\,\hat{j}+(-1-3)\,\hat{k}=6\hat{i}-2 \hat{j}-4\hat{k}\,\]

\[\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\ =(7+2)\,\hat{i}+(0-3)\,\hat{j}+(-1-5)\,\hat{k}=9\hat{i}-3 \hat{j}-6\hat{k}\]

\[|\,\overline{\mathrm{AB}}\ |=\sqrt{14}\,\ |\,\overline{\mathrm{BC}}\ |=2\sqrt{14}\ \ \ \mathrm{and}\ |\,\overline{\mathrm{AC}}\ |=3\sqrt{14}\]

Therefore

Hence the points \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) are collinear.

**Note** In Example 21, one may note that although \(\overline{\mathrm{AB}+\overline{\mathrm{BC}}+\overline{\mathrm{CA}}=\bar{0}}\) but the points \(\mathrm{A}\), \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{C}\) do not form the vertices of a triangle.

**Exercise 10.3**

**10.**: If \(\bar{a}=2\hat{i}+2\,\hat{j}+3\hat{k}\), \(\bar{b}=-\hat{i}+2\,\hat{j}+\hat{k}\) and \(\bar{c}=3\hat{i}+\hat{j}\) are such that \(\bar{a}+\lambda\bar{b}\) is perpendicular to \(\bar{c}\,\), then find the value of \(\lambda\).
**11.**: Show that \(|\,\bar{a}\,|\,\bar{b}+|\,\bar{b}\,|\,\bar{a}\) is perpendicular to \(|\,\bar{a}\,|\,\bar{b}-|\,\bar{b}\,|\,\bar{a}\), for any two nonzero vectors \(\bar{a}\) and \(\bar{b}\).
**12.**: If \(\bar{a}\cdot\bar{a}=0\) and \(\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}=0\), then what can be concluded about the vector \(\bar{b}\,\)?
**13.**: If \(\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c}\) are unit vectors such that \(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}=0\,\), find the value of \(\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{b}\cdot\bar{c}+\bar{c}\cdot\bar{a}\).
**14.**: If either vector \(\bar{a}=\bar{0}\) or \(\bar{b}=\bar{0}\), then \(\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}=0\). But the converse need not be true. Justify your answer with an example.
**15.**: If the vertices A, B, C of a triangle ABC are (1, 2, 3), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 2), respectively, then find \(\angle\)ABC, \(\angle\)ABC is the angle between the vectors BA and BC].
**16.**: Show that the points A(1, 2, 7), B(2, 6, 3) and C(3, 10, -1) are collinear.
**17.**: Show that the vectors \(2\hat{i}-\hat{j}+\hat{k}\), \(\hat{i}-3\hat{j}-5\hat{k}\) and \(3\hat{i}-4\hat{j}-4\hat{k}\) form the vertices of a right angled triangle.
**18.**: If \(\bar{a}\) is a nonzero vector of magnitude '\(a\)' and \(\lambda\) a nonzero scalar, then \(\lambda\bar{a}\) is unit vector if

(A) \(\lambda=1\) (B) \(\lambda=-1\) (C) \(a=1\lambda|\) (D) \(a=1/\lambda|\)

#### Vector (or cross) product of two vectors

In Section 10.2, we have discussed on the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system. In this system, when the positive \(x\)-axis is rotated counterclockwise

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:638]

In particular, \(\bar{a}\times\bar{a}=\bar{0}\) and \(\bar{a}\times(-\bar{a})=\bar{0}\), since in the first situation, \(\theta=0\) and in the second one, \(\theta=\pi\), making the value of \(\sin\theta\) to be \(0\).
3. If \(\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}\) then \(\bar{a}\times\bar{b}=\mid\bar{a}\parallel\bar{b}\mid\).
4. In view of the Observations 2 and 3, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors \(\hat{\hat{i}}\), \(\hat{j}\) and \(\hat{k}\) (Fig 10.24), we have \(\hat{\hat{i}}\times\hat{i}=\hat{j}\times\hat{j}=\hat{k}\times\hat{k}=\bar{0}\) \(\hat{\hat{i}}\times\hat{j}=\hat{k}\), \(\hat{\hat{j}}\times\hat{k}=\hat{i}\), \(\hat{k}\times\hat{i}=\hat{j}\) Fig 10.24
5. In terms of vector product, the angle between two vectors \(\bar{a}\) and \(\bar{b}\) may be given as \(\sin\theta=\frac{\mid\bar{a}\times\bar{b}\mid}{\mid\bar{a}\parallel\bar{b}\mid}\)
6. It is always true that the vector product is not commutative, as \(\bar{a}\times\bar{b}=-\bar{b}\times\bar{a}\). Indeed, \(\bar{a}\times\bar{b}=\mid\bar{a}\parallel\bar{b}\mid\sin\theta\,\hat{n}\), where \(\bar{a},\bar{b}\) and \(\hat{n}\) form a right handed system, i.e., \(\theta\) is traversed from \(\bar{a}\) to \(\bar{b}\), Fig 10.25 (i). While, \(\bar{b}\times\bar{a}=\mid\bar{a}\parallel\bar{b}\mid\sin\theta\,\hat{n}_{ \hat{1}}\), where \(\bar{b}\), \(\bar{a}\) and \(\hat{n}_{\hat{1}}\) form a right handed system i.e. \(\theta\) is traversed from \(\bar{b}\) to \(\bar{a}\), Fig 10.25(ii).

**Fig 10.25 (i), (ii)**

Thus, if we assume \(\bar{a}\) and \(\bar{b}\) to lie in the plane of the paper, then \(\hat{n}\) and \(\hat{n}_{\hat{1}}\) both will be perpendicular to the plane of the paper. But, \(\hat{n}\) being directed above the paper while \(\hat{n}_{\hat{1}}\) directed below the paper. i.e. \(\hat{n}_{\hat{1}}=-\hat{n}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:640]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:641]

**Example 23**: Find a unit vector perpendicular to each of the vectors \((\vec{a}+\vec{b})\) and \((\vec{a}-\vec{b})\), where \(\vec{a}=\hat{i}+\hat{j}+\hat{k}\), \(\vec{b}=\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+3\hat{k}\).

**Solution** We have \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+4\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}=-\hat{j}-2\hat{k}\)

A vector which is perpendicular to both \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}\) is given by

\[(\vec{a}+\vec{b})\times(\vec{a}-\vec{b})\,=\,\begin{bmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}& \hat{k}\\ 2&3&4\\ 0&-1&-2\end{bmatrix}=-2\hat{i}+4\hat{j}-2\hat{k}\ \ (=\vec{c},\text{ say})\]

Now

\[|\,\vec{c}\,|=\sqrt{4+16+4}=\sqrt{24}=2\sqrt{6}\]

Therefore, the required unit vector is

\[\frac{\vec{c}}{|\,\vec{c}\,|}=\frac{\cdot}{\sqrt{6}}\hat{i}+\frac{2}{\sqrt{6} }\hat{j}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\hat{k}\]

Note. There are two perpendicular directions to any plane. Thus, another unit vector perpendicular to \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}\) will be \(\sqrt{6}\hat{i}-\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\hat{j}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\hat{k}\). But that will be a consequence of \((\vec{a}-\vec{b})\times(\vec{a}+\vec{b})\).

**Example 24**: Find the area of a triangle having the points A(1, 1, 1), B(1, 2, 3) and C(2, 3, 1) as its vertices.

**Solution** We have \(\overline{\text{AB}}=\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\) and \(\overline{\text{AC}}=\hat{i}+2\hat{j}\). The area of the given triangle is \(\frac{1}{2}\,|\,\overline{\text{AB}}\times\overline{\text{AC}}\,|\).

Now,

\[\overline{\text{AB}}\times\overline{\text{AC}}\,=\,\begin{bmatrix}\hat{i}& \hat{j}&\hat{k}\\ 0&1&2\\ 1&2&0\end{bmatrix}=-4\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-\hat{k}\]

Therefore

\[|\,\overline{\text{AB}}\times\overline{\text{AC}}\,|=\sqrt{16+4+1}=\sqrt{21}\]

Thus, the required area is \(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{21}\)

**Example 25**: Find the area of a parallelogram whose adjacent sides are given by the vectors \(\vec{a}=3\hat{i}+\hat{j}+4\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=\hat{i}-\hat{j}+\hat{k}\)

**Solution** The area of a parallelogram with \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) as its adjacent sides is given by \(\mid\!\vec{a}\times\vec{b}\mid\).

Now

\[\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\ 3&1&4\\ 1&-1&1\end{vmatrix}=5\hat{i}+\hat{j}-4\hat{k}\]

Therefore

\[\mid\!\vec{a}\times\vec{b}\mid\!=\sqrt{25+1+16}=\sqrt{42}\]

and hence, the required area is \(\sqrt{42}\).

**EXERCISE 10.4**

**1.** Find \(\mid\!\vec{a}\times\vec{b}\mid\), if \(\vec{a}=\hat{i}-7\hat{j}+7\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=3\hat{i}-2\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\),

**2.** Find a unit vector perpendicular to each of the vector \(\vec{a}+\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}\), where \(\vec{a}=3\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}\equiv\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-2\hat{k}\).

**3.** If a unit vector \(\vec{a}\) makes angles \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) with \(\hat{i},\frac{\pi}{4}\) with \(\hat{j}\) and an acute angle \(\theta\) with \(\hat{k}\), then find \(\theta\) and hence, the components of \(\vec{a}\).

**4.** Show that

\[(\vec{a}-\vec{b})\times(\vec{a}+\vec{b})=2(\vec{a}\times\vec{b})\]

**5.** Find \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\) if \((\vec{2}\hat{i}+6\hat{j}+27\hat{k})\times(\hat{i}+\lambda\hat{j}+\mu\hat{k})= \vec{0}\).

**6.** Given that \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}=0\) and \(\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\vec{0}\). What can you conclude about the vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\)?

**7.** Let the vectors \(\vec{a},\vec{b}\), \(\vec{c}\) be given as \(\vec{a_{1}\hat{i}+a_{2}\hat{j}+a_{3}\hat{k}}\), \(\vec{b_{1}\hat{i}+b_{2}\hat{j}+b_{3}\hat{k}}\), \(\vec{c_{1}\hat{i}+c_{2}\hat{j}+c_{3}\hat{k}}\). Then show that \(\vec{a}\times(\vec{b}+\vec{c})=\vec{a}\times\vec{b}+\vec{a}\times\vec{c}\).

**8.** If either \(\vec{a}=\vec{0}\) or \(\vec{b}=\vec{0}\), then \(\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\vec{0}\). Is the converse true? Justify your answer with an example.

**9.** Find the area of the triangle with vertices A(1, 1, 2), B(2, 3, 5) and C(1, 5, 5).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:644]

**Example 27**: If \(\hat{i}+\hat{j}+\hat{k}\), \(2\hat{i}+5\hat{j}\), \(3\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-3\hat{k}\) and \(\hat{i}-6\hat{j}-\hat{k}\) are the position vectors of points A, B, C and D respectively, then find the angle between \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) and \(\overline{\text{CD}}\). Deduce that \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) and \(\overline{\text{CD}}\) are collinear.

**Solution** Note that if \(\theta\) is the angle between AB and CD, then \(\theta\) is also the angle between \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) and \(\overline{\text{CD}}\).

Now

\[\overline{\text{AB}} =\text{Position vector of B }-\text{Position vector of A}\] \[=(2\hat{i}+5\hat{j})-(\hat{i}+\hat{j}+\hat{k})=\hat{i}+4\hat{j}- \hat{k}\] Therefore

\[|\overline{\text{AB}}| =\sqrt{(1)^{2}+(4)^{2}+(-1)^{2}}=3\sqrt{2}\]

Similarly

\[\overline{\text{CD}} =-2\hat{i}-8\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\text{ \ and \ }|\overline{\text{CD}}|=6\sqrt{2}\] Thus

\[\cos\theta =\frac{\overline{\text{AB}}\cdot\overline{\text{CD}}}{|\overline{ \text{AB}}|\overline{\text{CD}}|}\]

Since \(0\leq\theta\leq\pi\), it follows that \(\theta=\pi\). This shows that \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) and \(\overline{\text{CD}}\) are collinear.

**Alternatively**, \(\overline{\text{AB}}=-\frac{1}{2}\overline{\text{CD}}\) which implies that \(\overline{\text{AB}}\) and \(\overline{\text{CD}}\) are collinear vectors.

**Example 28**: Let \(\bar{a},\bar{b}\) and \(\bar{c}\) be three vectors such that \(|\bar{a}\,|=3,|\,\bar{b}\,|=4,|\bar{c}\,|=5\) and each one of them being perpendicular to the sum of the other two, find \(|\,\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}\,|\).

**Solution** Given \(\bar{a}\cdot(\bar{b}+\bar{c})\,\hat{=}\,\overline{0},\bar{b}\cdot(\bar{c}+ \bar{a})=0\), \(\bar{c}\cdot(\bar{a}+\bar{b})=0\).

Now

\[|\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}\,|^{2} =(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c})^{2}=(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c})\cdot( \bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c})\] \[=\bar{a}\cdot\bar{a}+\bar{a}\cdot(\bar{b}+\bar{c})+\bar{b}\cdot \bar{b}+\bar{b}\cdot(\bar{a}+\bar{c})\] \[+\ \bar{c}.(\bar{a}+\bar{b})+\bar{c}\,\bar{c}\] \[=\ |\,\bar{a}\,|^{2}+|\,\bar{b}\,|^{2}+|\,\bar{c}\,|^{2}\] \[=9+16+25=50\]

Therefore

\[|\,\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}\,|\,=\sqrt{50}=5\sqrt{2}\]

**Example 29** Three vectors \(\bar{a}\), \(\bar{b}\) and \(\bar{c}\) satisfy the condition \(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}=\bar{0}\). Evaluate the quantity \(\mu=\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{b}\cdot\bar{c}+\bar{c}\cdot\bar{a}\), if \(|\bar{a}|=3\), \(|\bar{b}|=4\) and \(|\bar{c}|=2\).

**Solution** Since \(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}=\bar{0}\), we have

\[\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}=\bar{0}\ =0\]

or

\[\bar{a}\cdot\bar{a}+\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{a}\cdot\bar{c}\ =0\]

Therefore

\[\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{a}\cdot\bar{c}=-\left|\bar{a}\right|^{2}=-9\]

Again,

\[\bar{b}\cdot\left(\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}\right)\ =0\]

or

\[\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{b}\cdot\bar{c}=-\left|\bar{b}\right|^{2}=-16\]

Similarly

\[\bar{a}\cdot\bar{c}+\bar{b}\cdot\bar{c}\ =-4\]

Adding (1), (2) and (3), we have

\[2\ (\bar{a}\cdot\bar{b}+\bar{b}\cdot\bar{c}+\bar{a}\cdot\bar{c})=29\]

or

\[2\mu=-29\]

, i.e.,

\[\mu=\frac{-29}{2}\]

**Example 30** If with reference to the right handed system of mutually perpendicular unit vectors \(\hat{i}\), \(\hat{j}\) and \(\hat{k}\), \(\bar{\alpha}=\hat{3}\hat{i}\hat{j}\), \(\bar{\beta}=2\hat{i}+\hat{j}-3\hat{k}\), then express \(\bar{\beta}\) in the form \(\bar{\beta}=\bar{\beta}_{1}+\bar{\beta}_{2}\), where \(\bar{\beta}_{1}\) is parallel to \(\bar{\alpha}\) and \(\bar{\beta}_{2}\) is perpendicular to \(\bar{\alpha}\).

**Solution** Let \(\bar{\beta}_{1}=\lambda\bar{\alpha}\), \(\lambda\) is a scalar, i.e., \(\bar{\beta}_{1}=3\lambda\hat{i}-\lambda\hat{j}\).

Now

\[\bar{\beta}_{2}=\bar{\beta}-\bar{\beta}_{1}=(2-3\lambda)\hat{i}+(1+\lambda) \hat{j}-3\hat{k}.\]

Now, since \(\bar{\beta}_{2}\) is to be perpendicular to \(\bar{\alpha}\), we should have \(\bar{\alpha}\cdot\bar{\beta}_{2}=0\). i.e.,

\[3(2-3\lambda)-(1+\lambda)\ =0\]

or

\[\lambda=\frac{1}{2}\]

Therefore

\[\bar{\beta}_{1}=\frac{3}{2}\hat{i}-\frac{1}{2}\hat{j}\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \bar{\beta}_{2}=\frac{1}{2}\hat{i}+\frac{3}{2}\hat{j}-3\hat{k}\]

### Historical Note

The word _vector_ has been derived from a Latin word _vectus_, which means "to carry". The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800 when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described that how a complex number \(a+ib\) could be given a geometric interpretation with the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton (1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a directed line segment in his book _Lectures on Quaternions_ (1853). Hamilton's method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as: \(a+b\hat{t}+c\hat{j}+d\hat{k}\), \(\hat{i}\), \(\hat{j}\), \(\hat{k}\) following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of geometric addition of forces in his treatise _DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst_ ("Principles of the Art of Weighing"), which caused a major breakthrough in the development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept of vectors to form.

In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created what we now know as _vector analysis_, essentially by separating the real (_scalar_)part of quaternion from its imaginary (_vector_) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs printed a treatise entitled _Element of Vector Analysis_. This book gave a systematic and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G Tait (1831-1901) who contributed significantly to this subject.

### Introduction

In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the study simple and elegant*.

Footnote *: For various activities in three dimensional geometry, one may refer to the Book “_A Hand Book for designing Mathematics Laboratory in Schools”_, NCERT, 2005

In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space under different conditions; angle between two lines, two planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two skew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric and analytic picture of the situation.

### Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line

From Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes angles \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\)with \(x,y\) and \(z\)-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine of these angles, namely, \(\cos\,\alpha\), \(\cos\,\beta\) and \(\cos\,\gamma\) are called direction cosines of the directed line L.

If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements, i.e., \(\pi-\alpha\), \(\pi-\beta\) and \(\pi-\gamma\). Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:653]

Hence, from (1), the \(d.c.\)'\(s\) of the line are

\[\cdot\]

\[l\!=\!\pm\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}},m\!=\!\pm\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^ {2}}},n\!=\!\pm\frac{c}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}}\]

where, depending on the desired sign of \(k\), either a positive or a negative sign is to be taken for \(l\), \(m\) and \(n\).

For any line, if \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) are direction ratios of a line, then \(ka\), \(kb\), \(kc\); \(k\neq 0\) is also a set of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional. Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios.

#### 11.2.1 Direction cosines of a line passing through two points

Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the direction cosines of a line passing through the given points \(\mathrm{P}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})\) and \(\mathrm{Q}(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})\) as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)).

**Fig 11.2**

Let \(l\), \(m\), \(n\) be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) with the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axis, respectively.

Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a perpendicular from P to QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, \(\angle\)PQN\(=\gamma\) (Fig 11.2 (b).

Therefore,

\[\cos\gamma=\frac{\cdot}{\mathrm{NQ}}=\frac{z_{2}-z_{1}}{\mathrm{PQ}}\]

Similarly

\[\cos\alpha=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{\mathrm{PQ}}\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\;\cos\beta\!=\! \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{\mathrm{PQ}}\]

Hence, the direction cosines of the line segment joining the points \(\mathrm{P}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})\) and \(\mathrm{Q}(x_{2},\;y_{2},\;z_{2})\) are \[\frac{x_{2}\ -\ x_{1}}{\text{PQ}}\,\ \frac{y_{2}\ -\ y_{1}}{\text{PQ}}\,\ \frac{z_{2}\ -\ z_{1}}{\text{PQ}}\]

where PQ = \(\sqrt{\left(x_{2}\ -\ x_{1}\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(y_{2}\ -\ y_{1}\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(z_{2}\ -\ z_{1}\right)^{2}}\)

NoteThe direction ratios of the line segment joining P(\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\), \(z_{1}\)) and Q(\(x_{2}\), \(y_{2}\), \(z_{2}\)) may be taken as

\[x_{2}-x_{1},\ y_{2}-y_{1},\ z_{2}-z_{1}\ \text{or}\ x_{1}-x_{2},\ y_{1}-y_{2},\ z _{1}-z_{2}\]

Example1If a line makes angle \(90^{\circ}\), \(60^{\circ}\) and \(30^{\circ}\) with the positive direction of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axis respectively, find its direction cosines.

SolutionLet the \(d\,.\,c\,\)'\(s\) of the lines be \(l\), \(m\), \(n\). Then \(l\) = cos \(90^{0}\) = 0, \(m\) = cos \(60^{0}\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\),

\[n\]

= cos \(30^{0}\) = \(\frac{\cdot}{2}\).

Example2If a line has direction ratios \(2\), \(-1\), \(-2\), determine its direction cosines.

SolutionDirection cosines are

\[\frac{2}{\sqrt{2^{2}\ +\left(-1\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(-2\right)^{2}}},\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2^{2}+\left(-1\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(-2\right)^{2}}},\ \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2^{2}\ +\left(-1\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(-2\right)^{2}}}\]

or

Example3Find the direction cosines of the line passing through the two points (\(-\) 2, 4, \(-\) 5) and (1, 2, 3).

SolutionWe know the direction cosines of the line passing through two points P(\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\), \(z_{1}\)) and Q(\(x_{2}\), \(y_{2}\), \(z_{2}\)) are given by

\[\frac{x_{2}\ -x_{1}}{\text{PQ}},\ \ \frac{y_{2}\ -\ y_{1}}{\text{PQ}},\ \ \frac{z_{2}\ -z_{1}}{\text{PQ}}\]

where PQ = \(\sqrt{\left(x_{2}\ -\ x_{1}\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(y_{2}\ -\ y_{1}\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(z_{2}\ -z_{1}\right)^{2}}\)

Here P is (\

**Example 4**: Find the direction cosines of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axis.

**Solution** The \(x\)-axis makes angles \(0^{\circ}\), \(90^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) respectively with \(x,y\) and \(z\)-axis. Therefore, the direction cosines of \(x\)-axis are cos \(0^{\circ}\), cos \(90^{\circ}\), cos \(90^{\circ}\) i.e., 1,0,0.

Similarly, direction cosines of \(y\)-axis and \(z\)-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively.

**Example 5**: Show that the points A (2, 3, - 4), B (1, - 2, 3) and C (3, 8, - 11) are collinear.

**Solution** Direction ratios of line joining A and B are

\(1-2,-2-3\), \(3+4\) i.e., \(-1,-5\), 7.

The direction ratios of line joining B and C are

\(3-1,8+2,-11-3\), i.e., \(2,10,-14\).

It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel to BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are collinear points.

**EXERCISE 11.1**

1. If a line makes angles \(90^{\circ}\), \(135^{\circ}\), \(45^{\circ}\) with the \(x,y\) and \(z\)-axes respectively, find its direction cosines.

2. Find the direction cosines of a line which makes equal angles with the coordinate axes.

3. If a line has the direction ratios \(-18,12\); \(-4\), then what are its direction cosines?

4. Show that the points (2, 3, 4), \((-1,-2,1)\), (5, 8, 7) are collinear.

5. Find the direction cosines of the sides of the triangle whose vertices are (3, 5, - 4), (- 1, 1, 2) and (- 5, 5, - 2).

**11.3 Equation of a Line in Space**

We have studied equation of lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study the vector and cartesian equations of a line in space.

A line is uniquely determined if

1. it passes through a given point and has given direction, or
2. it passes through two given points.

**11.3.1 Equation of a line through a given point and parallel to a given vector \(\bar{b}\)**

Let \(\bar{a}\) be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the rectangular coordinate system. Let \(l\) be the line which passes through the point A and is parallel to a given vector \(\vec{b}\). Let \(\vec{r}\) be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the line (Fig 11.3).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:657]

Therefore, the vector equation of the line is

\[\vec{r}=\hat{5}\ \hat{i}+2\ \hat{j}-4\ \hat{k}+\lambda\ (\ 3\ \hat{i}+2\ \hat{j}-8\ \hat{k})\]

Now, \(\vec{r}\) is the position vector of any point P(\(x\), \(y\), \(z\)) on the line.

Therefore, \(\hat{x}\hat{i}+y\ \hat{j}+z\ \hat{k}=5\hat{i}+2\hat{j}-4\hat{k}+\lambda\ (\ 3\ \hat{i}+2\ \hat{j}-8\ \hat{k})\)

\[=(5+3\lambda)\ \hat{i}+(2+2\lambda)\ \hat{j}+(-4-8\lambda)\ \hat{k}\]

Eliminating \(\lambda\), we get

\[\frac{\cdot}{3}=\frac{\cdot}{2}=\frac{z+4}{-8}\]

which is the equation of the line in Cartesian form.

### Angle between Two Lines

Let L\({}_{1}\) and L\({}_{2}\) be two lines passing through the origin and with direction ratios \(a_{1}\), \(b_{1}\), \(c_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\), \(b_{2}\), \(c_{2}\), respectively. Let P be a point on L\({}_{1}\) and Q be a point on L\({}_{2}\). Consider the directed lines OP and OQ as given in Fig 11.6. Let \(\theta\) be the acute angle between OP and OQ. Now recall that the directed line segments OP and OQ are vectors with components \(a_{1}\), \(b_{1}\), \(c_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\), \(b_{2}\), \(c_{2}\), respectively. Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) between them is given by

\[\cos\theta=\left|\frac{\hat{a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+c_{1}c_{2}}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2 }+b_{1}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}}\sqrt{a_{2}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}\right|... \tag{1}\]

The angle between the lines in terms of \(\sin\theta\) is given by

\[\sin\theta=\sqrt{1-\cos^{2}\theta}\]

\[=\frac{\sqrt{\left(a_{1}^{2}+b_{1}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}\right)\left(a_{2}^{2}+b_{2} ^{2}+c_{2}^{2}\right)-\left(a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+c_{1}c_{2}\right)^{2}}}{ \sqrt{\left(a_{1}^{2}+b_{1}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}\right)\sqrt{\left(a_{2}^{2}+b_{2}^{ 2}+c_{2}^{2}\right)}}}\]

\[=\frac{\sqrt{\left(a_{1}\ b_{2}-a_{2}\ b_{1}\right)^{2}\ +\ \left(b_{1}\ c_{2}\ -\ b_{2}\ c_{1}\ \right)^{2}+\left(c_{1}\ a_{2}\ -\ c_{2}\ a_{1}\ \right)^{2}}}{\sqrt{\ a_{1}^{2}\ +\ b_{1}^{2}\ +\ c_{1}^{2}}}\ \ \ \ \sqrt{a_{2}^{2}\ +\ b_{2}^{2}\ +c_{2}^{2}}\ \ \ \ \... \tag{2}\]NoteIn case the lines \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\)and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) do not pass through the origin, we may take lines \(\mathrm{L}_{1}^{\prime}\)and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}^{\prime}\) which are parallel to \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) respectively and pass through the origin.

If instead of direction ratios for the lines \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\), direction cosines, namely, \(l_{1}\), \(m_{1}\), \(n_{1}\) for \(\mathrm{L}_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\), \(m_{2}\), \(n_{2}\) for \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\) are given, then (1) and (2) takes the following form:

\[\cos\ \theta=\left|\begin{array}{cc}l_{1}&l_{2}&+&m_{1}m_{2}&+&n_{1}m_{2} \end{array}\right|\quad\text{(as }\overset{\cdot}{l_{1}}^{2}+m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}= \overset{\cdot}{1}=l_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}\,\text{)}\qquad... \tag{3}\]

and \[\sin\ \theta=\sqrt{\left(l_{1}\,m_{2}-l_{2}\,m_{1}\right)^{2}-\left(m_{1}\,n_{ 2}-m_{2}\,n_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(n_{1}\,l_{2}-n_{2}\,l_{1}\right)^{2}}\qquad \qquad\qquad...\] (4)

Two lines with direction ratios \(a_{1}\), \(b_{1}\), \(c_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\), \(b_{2}\), \(c_{2}\) are

1. perpendicular i.e. if \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) by (1)
2. parallel i.e. if \(\theta=0\) by (2) \[\frac{a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+c_{1}c_{2}=0}{a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+c_{1}c_{2}}\]

Now, we find the angle between two lines when their equations are given. If \(\theta\) is acute the angle between the lines

\[\overset{\cdot}{r}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{1}}+\overset{\cdot}{\lambda}\overset{ \cdot}{b_{1}}\text{ and }\overset{\cdot}{r}=\overset{\cdot}{a_{2}}+\mu\,\overset{\cdot}{b_{2}}\]

then

\[\cos\theta=\left|\begin{array}{cc}\overset{\cdot}{b_{1}}\overset{\cdot}{b_ {2}}\\ \hline\left|\overset{\cdot}{b_{1}}\right|\left|\overset{\cdot}{b_{2}}\right| \end{array}\right|\]

In Cartesian form, if \(\theta\) is the angle between the lines

\[\overset{\cdot}{a_{1}}=\overset{\cdot}{\frac{y-y_{1}}{b_{1}}}=\frac{z-z_{1}} {c_{1}}\qquad\qquad\qquad... \tag{1}\]

and

\[\overset{\cdot}{a_{2}}=\overset{\cdot}{\frac{y-y_{2}}{b_{2}}}=\frac{z-z_{2}} {c_{2}}\qquad\qquad\qquad... \tag{2}\]

where, \(a_{i}\), \(b_{1}\), \(c_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\), \(b_{2}\), \(c_{2}\) are the direction ratios of the lines (1) and (2), respectively, then

\[\cos\ \theta=\left|\begin{array}{c}\frac{a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+c_{1}c_{2}}{ \sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+b_{1}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}\sqrt{a_{2}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\\ \end{array}\right|\]

Example 7: Find the angle between the pair of lines given by

\[\overset{\cdot}{r}=\overset{\cdot}{3}\overset{\cdot}{i}+2\overset{\cdot}{j} -4\,\overset{\cdot}{k}+\lambda(\overset{\cdot}{i}+2\,\overset{\cdot}{j}+2\, \overset{\cdot}{k})\]and

\[\vec{r}=\hat{5}\hat{i}-2\hat{j}+\mu(3\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+6\hat{k})\]

**Solution** Here \(\vec{b}_{1}=\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+2\hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}_{2}=3\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+6\hat{k}\)

The angle \(\theta\) between the two lines is given by

\[\cos\ \theta =\left|\frac{\vec{b}_{1}\cdot\vec{b}_{2}}{\left|\hat{b}_{1} \right|\left|\vec{b}_{2}\right|}\right|=\left|\frac{(\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+2\hat{k} )\cdot(3\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+6\hat{k})}{\sqrt{1+4+4}\sqrt{9+4+36}}\right|\] \[=\left|\frac{3+4+12}{3\times 7}\right|=\frac{19}{21}\]

Hence

\[\theta=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{19}{21}\right)\]

**Example 8**: Find the angle between the pair of lines

\[\frac{x+3}{3}=\frac{y-1}{5}=\frac{z+3}{4}\]

and

\[\frac{x+1}{1}=\frac{y-4}{1}=\frac{z-5}{2}\]

**Solution** The direction ratios of the first line are 3, 5, 4 and the direction ratios of the second line are 1, 1, 2. If \(\theta\) is the angle between them, then

\[\cos\ \theta=\left|\frac{3.1+5.1+4.2}{\sqrt{3^{2}+5^{2}+4^{2}}\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2} +2^{2}}}=\frac{16}{\sqrt{50}\sqrt{6}}=\frac{16}{5\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}}=\frac{8 \sqrt{3}}{15}\right.\]

Hence, the required angle is \(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{15}\right)\).

### Shortest Distance between Two Lines

If two lines in space intersect at a point, then the shortest distance between them is zero. Also, if two lines in space are parallel, then the shortest distance between them will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the length of the perpendicular drawn from a point on one line onto the other line.

Further, in a space, there are lines which are neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact, such pair of lines are _non coplanar_ and are called _skew lines_. For example, let us consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\)-axes respectively Fig 11.5.

Hence, the required shortest distance is

\[d=\text{PQ}=\text{ST}\ |\cos\ \theta|\]

or

\[\boldsymbol{d}=\left|\ \frac{(\bar{b}_{|}\times\bar{b}_{2})\.\ (\bar{a}_{2} \times\bar{a}_{|})}{|\bar{b}_{1}\times\bar{b}_{2}|}\ \right|\]

### Cartesian form

The shortest distance between the lines

\[l_{1}:\ \frac{x-x_{1}}{a_{1}}\ =\ \frac{y-y_{1}}{b_{1}}\ =\ \frac{z-z_{1}}{c_{1}}\]

and

\[l_{2}:\ \frac{x-x_{2}}{a_{2}}\ =\ \frac{y-y_{2}}{b_{2}}\ =\ \frac{z-z_{2}}{c_{2}}\]

is

\[\left|\ \frac{\left|\ \begin{array}{cc}\boldsymbol{x}_{2}-\boldsymbol{x}_{1} &\boldsymbol{y}_{2}-\boldsymbol{y}_{1}\\ \boldsymbol{a}_{1}&\boldsymbol{b}_{1}\\ \boldsymbol{a}_{2}&\boldsymbol{b}_{2}\\ \end{array}\right.}{\sqrt{(\boldsymbol{b}_{1}c_{2}-b_{2}c_{1})^{2}+(c_{1}a_ {2}-c_{2}a_{1})^{2}+(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1})^{2}}}\right|\]

#### 11.5.2 Distance between parallel lines

If two lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\) are parallel, then they are coplanar. Let the lines be given by

\[\bar{r}=\bar{a}_{1}\ +\ \lambda\ \bar{b}\]

... (1)

and

\[\bar{r}=\bar{a}_{2}\ +\ \mu\ \bar{b}\]

... (2)

where, \(\bar{a}_{1}\) is the position vector of a point S on \(l_{1}\) and \(\bar{a}_{2}\) is the position vector of a point T on \(l_{2}\) Fig 11.7.

As \(l_{1}\), \(l_{2}\) are coplanar, if the foot of the perpendicular from T on the line \(l_{1}\) is P, then the distance between the lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}=\ |\text{TP}|\).

Let \(\theta\) be the angle between the vectors \(\widetilde{\text{ST}}\) and \(\bar{b}\). Then

\[\bar{b}\ \times\widetilde{\text{ST}}=(\ \ \boldsymbol{|\ \bar{b}\ \ |\ \widetilde{\text{ST}}|}\sin\ \theta)\,\hat{n}\ \,...\]

where \(\hat{n}\) is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the lines \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\).

The mathematical experience of the student is incomplete if he never had the opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself. - G. POLYA

### Introduction

In earlier classes, we have discussed systems of linear equations and their applications in day to day problems. In Class XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems of linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by graphical method. Many applications in mathematics involve systems of inequalities/equations. In this chapter, we shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations to solve some real life problems of the type as given below:

A furniture dealer deals in only two items-tables and chairs. He has Rs 50,000 to invest and has storage space of at most 60 pieces. A table costs Rs 2500, and a chair Rs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he can make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one chair a profit of Rs 75. He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy from the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all the items which he buys.

Such type of problems which seek to maximise (or, minimise) profit (or, cost) form a general class of problems called **optimisation problems**. Thus, an optimisation problem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of resources etc.

A special but a very important class of optimisation problems is **linear programming problem.** The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming problem. Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide applicability in industry, commerce, management science etc.

In this chapter, we shall study some linear programming problems and their solutions by graphical method only, though there are many other methods also to solve such problems.

### Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation

We begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further lead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables. In this example, we observe

1. The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof. Further he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies.
2. There are certain **overriding conditions** or **constraints** viz., his investment is limited to a **maximum** of Rs 50,000 and so is his storage space which is for a maximum of 60 pieces.

Suppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy 50000 = 2500, i.e., 20 tables. His profit in this case will be Rs (250 \(\times\) 20), i.e., **Rs 5000**.

Suppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables. With his capital of Rs 50,000, he can buy 50000 \(\div\) 500, i.e. 100 chairs. But he can store only 60 pieces. Therefore, he is forced to buy only 60 chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs (60 \(\times\) 75), i.e., **Rs 4500**.

There are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy 10 tables and 50 chairs, as he can store only 60 pieces. Total profit in this case would be Rs (10 \(\times\) 250 + 50 \(\times\) 75), i.e., **Rs 6250** and so on,

We, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in different ways and he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies.

Now the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum profit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically.

#### 12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem

Let \(x\) be the number of tables and \(y\) be the number of chairs that the dealer buys. Obviously, \(x\) and \(y\) must be non-negative, i.e.,

\[x\geq 0\]... (1) \[y\geq 0\]... (2)

The dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is Rs 50,000) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is 60).

Stated mathematically,

\[2500x+500y \leq 50000\] (investment constraint)

or

\[5x+y \leq 100\]... (3)

and

\[x+y \leq 60\] (storage constraint)... (4)The dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say, Z which stated as a function of \(x\) and \(y\) is given by

\[Z=250x+75y\]

... (5)

Mathematically, the given problems now reduces to:

Maximise Z = 250x+75y

subject to the constraints:

\[5x+y\leq 100\]

\[x+y\leq 60\]

\[x\geq 0,\;\;y\geq 0\]

So, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. There are also some other problems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. Such problems are called **Linear Programming Problems**.

Thus, a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the **optimal value** (maximum or minimum value) of a linear function (called **objective function**) of several variables (say \(x\) and \(y\)), subject to the conditions that the variables are **non-negative** and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called **linear constraints**). The term **linear** implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are **linear relations** while the term programming refers to the method of determining a particular **programme** or plan of action.

Before we proceed further, we now formally define some terms (which have been used above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems:

**Objective function** Linear function Z = \(ax+by\), where \(a\), \(b\) are constants, which has to be maximised or minimized is called a linear **objective function.**

In the above example, Z = 250x+75y is a linear objective function. Variables \(x\) and \(y\) are called **decision variables**.

**Constraints** The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a linear programming problem are called **constraints**. The conditions \(x\geq 0\), \(y\geq 0\) are called non-negative restrictions. In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4) are **constraints**.

**Optimisation problem** A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear function (say of two variables \(x\) and \(y\)) subject to certain constraints as determined by a set of linear inequalities is called an **optimisation problem**. Linear programming problems are special type of optimisation problems. The above problem of investing a given sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation problem as well as of a linear programming problem.

We will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem. In this chapter, we will be concerned only with the graphical method.

#### Graphical method of solving linear programming problems

In Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two variables \(x\) and \(y\) and to find its solutions graphically. Let us refer to the problem of investment in tables and chairs discussed in Section 12.2. We will now solve this problem graphically. Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities:

\[5x+y \leq 100\]... (1) \[x+y \leq 60\]... (2) \[x \geq 0\]... (3) \[y \geq 0\]... (4)

The graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half planes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4). (Fig 12.1). Each point in this region represents a **feasible choice** open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs. The region, therefore, is called the **feasible region** for the problem. Every point of this region is called a **feasible solution** to the problem. Thus, we have,

**Feasible region** The common region determined by all the constraints including non-negative constraints \(x,y\geq 0\) of a linear programming problem is called the **feasible region** (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is the feasible region for the problem. The region other than feasible region is called an **infeasible region**.

**Feasible solutions** Points within and on the boundary of the feasible region represent feasible solutions of the constraints. In Fig 12.1, every point within and on the boundary of the feasible region OABC represents feasible solution to the problem. For example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible solution of the problem and so are the points (0, 60), (20, 0) etc.

Any point outside the feasible region is called an **infeasible solution.** For example, the point (25, 40) is an infeasible solution of the problem.

**Optimal (feasible) solution**: Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an **optimal solution.**

Now, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints as given in (1) to (4), and since there are **infinitely many points**, it is not evident how we should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function Z = \(250x+75y\). To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are fundamental in solving linear programming problems. The proofs of these theorems are beyond the scope of the book.

**Theorem 1**: Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming problem and let Z = \(ax+by\) be the objective function. When Z has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), where the variables \(x\) and \(y\) are subject to constraints described by linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point* (vertex) of the feasible region.

**Theorem 2**: Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let Z = \(ax+by\) be the objective function. If R is **bounded**, then the objective function Z has both a **maximum** and a **minimum** value on R and each of these occurs at a corner point (vertex) of R.

_Remark_: If R is **unbounded**, then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective function may not exist. However, if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R. (By Theorem 1).

In the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region are: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 50) and (0, 60) respectively. Let us now compute the values of Z at these points.

We have

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Vertex of the & Corresponding value \\ Feasible Region & of Z (in Rs) \\ \hline O (0,0) & 0 \\ C (0,60) & 4500 \\ B (10,50) & **6250** \\ A (20,0) & 5000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* A corner point of a feasible region is a point in the region which is the intersection of two boundary lines.
* A feasible region of a system of linear inequalities is said to be bounded if it can be enclosed within a circle. Otherwise, it is called unbounded. Unbounded means that the feasible region does extend indefinitely in any direction.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:674]

**Fig 12.2**

Hence, maximum value of Z is 120 at the point (30, 0).

**Example 2** Solve the following linear programming problem graphically: Minimise Z = 200 \(x\) + 500 \(y\)... (1) subject to the constraints:

\[x+2y\geq 10\]... (2) \[3x+4y\leq 24\]... (3) \[x\geq 0,\,y\geq 0\]... (4)

**Solution** The shaded region in Fig 12.3 is the feasible region ABC determined by the system of constraints (2) to (4), which is **bounded**. The coordinates of corner pointsA, B and C are (0,5), (4,3) and (0,6) respectively. Now we evaluate \(Z=200x+500y\) at these points.

Hence, minimum value of Z is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3)

**Example 3** Solve the following problem graphically:

Minimise and Maximise Z = \(3x+9y\)... (1)

subject to the constraints: \(x+3y\leq 60\)... (2)

\(x+y\geq 10\)... (3)

\(x\leq y\)... (4)

\(x\geq 0\), \(y\geq 0\)... (5)

**Solution** First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of linear inequalities (2) to (5). The feasible region ABCD is shown in the Fig 12.4. Note that the region is bounded. The coordinates of the corner points A, B, C and D are (0, 10), (5, 5), (15,15) and (0, 20) respectively.

We now find the minimum and maximum value of Z. From the table, we find that the minimum value of Z is 60 at the point B (5, 5) of the feasible region.

The maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points C (15, 15) and D (0, 20) and it is 180 in each case.

_Remark_ Observe that in the above example, the problem has multiple optimal solutions at the corner points C and D, i.e. the both points produce same maximum value 180. In such cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner points C and D also give the same maximum value. Same is also true in the case if the two points produce same minimum value.

**Example 4** Determine graphically the minimum value of the objective function

\[Z=-50x+20y\]

... (1)

subject to the constraints:

\[2x-y\geq-5\]

... (2)

\[3x+y\geq 3\]

... (3)

\[2x-3y\leq 12\]

... (4)

\[x\geq 0\]

,

\[y\geq 0\]

... (5)

**Solution** First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to (5). The feasible region (shaded) is shown in the Fig 12.5. Observe that the feasible region is **unbounded**.

We now evaluate Z at the corner points.

**Fig 12.5**

From this table, we find that \(-300\) is the smallest value of Z at the corner point (6, 0). Can we say that minimum value of Z is \(-300\)? Note that if the region would have been bounded, this smallest value of Z is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2). But here we see that the feasible region is unbounded. Therefore, \(-300\) may or may not be the minimum value of Z. To decide this issue, we graph the inequality

\[-50x+20y<-300\]

(see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.) i.e.,

\[-5x+2y<-30\]

and check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible region or not. If it has common points, then \(-300\) will not be the minimum value of Z. Otherwise, \(-300\) will be the minimum value of Z.

As shown in the Fig 12.5, it has common points. Therefore, Z = -50 \(x\) + 20 \(y\) has no minimum value subject to the given constraints.

In the above example, can you say whether \(z\) = - 50 \(x\) + 20 \(y\) has the maximum value 100 at (0,5)? For this, check whether the graph of - 50 \(x\) + 20 \(y\) > 100 has points in common with the feasible region. (Why?)

**Example 5** Minimise Z = \(3x\) + 2\(y\)

subject to the constraints:

\[x+y\geq 8\]... (1)

\[3x+5y\leq 15\]... (2)

\[x\geq 0\]

,

\[y\geq 0\]

... (3)

**Solution** Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig 12.6). Is there any feasible region? Why is so?

From Fig 12.6, you can see that there is no point satisfying all the constraints simultaneously. Thus, the problem is having no feasible region and hence no feasible solution.

_Remarks_ From the examples which we have discussed so far, we notice some general features of linear programming problems:

1. The feasible region is always a convex region.
2. The maximum (or minimum) solution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible region. If two corner points produce the same maximum (or minimum) value of the objective function, then every point on the line segment joining these points will also give the same maximum (or minimum) value.

**EXERCISE 12.1**

Solve the following Linear Programming Problems graphically:

1. Maximise Z = \(3x\) + 4\(y\) subject to the constraints : \(x\) + \(y\) \(\leq\) 4, \(x\) \(\geq\) 0, \(y\) \(\geq\) 0.

2. Minimise Z = - 3x + 4 y subject to \(x+2y\leq 8\), 3x + 2y \(\leq 12\), \(x\ \geq\ 0\), \(y\geq 0\).
3. Maximise Z = 5x + 3y subject to 3x + 5y \(\leq 15\), 5x + 2y \(\leq 10\), \(x\ \geq 0\), \(y\geq 0\).
4. Minimise Z = 3x + 5y such that \(x+3y\ \geq 3\), \(x+y\ \geq 2\), \(x\), \(y\geq 0\).
5. Maximise Z = 3x + 2y subject to \(x+2y\leq 10\), 3x + \(y\leq 15\), \(x\), \(y\geq 0\).
6. Minimise Z = \(x+2y\) subject to 2x + \(y\geq 3\), \(x+2y\geq 6\), \(x\), \(y\geq 0\).

Show that the minimum of Z occurs at more than two points.

7. Minimise and Maximise Z = 5x + 10 y subject to \(x+2y\ \leq 120\), \(x+y\geq 60\), \(x-2y\geq 0\), \(x\), \(y\geq 0\).
8. Minimise and Maximise Z = \(x+2y\) subject to \(x+2y\geq 100\), \(2x-y\leq 0\), \(2x+y\leq 200\); \(x\), \(y\geq 0\).
9. Maximise Z = - \(x+2y\), subject to the constraints: \(x\geq 3\), \(x+y\geq 5\), \(x+2y\geq 6\), \(y\geq 0\).
10. Maximise Z = \(x+y\), subject to \(x-y\leq-1\), \(-x+y\leq 0\), \(x\), \(y\ \geq 0\).

Summary

A linear programming problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of a linear function of several variables (called **objective function**) subject to the conditions that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear **constraints**). Variables are sometimes called **decision variables** and are **non-negative.**

Historical Note

In the World War II, when the war operations had to be planned to economise expenditure, maximise damage to the enemy, linear programming problems came to the forefront.

The first problem in linear programming was formulated in 1941 by the Russian mathematician, L. Kantorovich and the American economist, F. L. Hitchcock,both of whom worked at it independently of each other. This was the well known _transportation problem_. In 1945, an English economist, G.Stigler, described yet another linear programming problem - that of determining an _optimal diet_.

In 1947, the American economist, G B. Dantzig suggested an efficient method known as the simplex method which is an iterative procedure to solve any linear programming problem in a finite number of steps.

L. Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T. C. Koopmans were awarded the nobel prize in the year 1975 in economics for their pioneering work in linear programming. With the advent of computers and the necessary softwares, it has become possible to apply linear programming model to increasingly complex problems in many areas.

### 13.1 Introduction

In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment. We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the experiment. We have also established equivalence between the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the addition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss the important concept of conditional probability of an event given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of probability and independence of events. We shall also learn an important concept of random variable and its probability distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution. In the last section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution called Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.

### 13.2 Conditional Probability

Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes are equally likely to occur.

Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the experiment is

S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

Since the coins are fair, we can assign the probability \(\frac{1}{8}\) to each sample point. Let E be the event 'at least two heads appear' and F be the event 'first coin shows tail'. Then

\[\text{E = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}}\]

and F = \(\{\text{THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}}\)

Therefore P(E) = P (\(\{\text{HHH}\}\)) + P (\(\{\text{HHT}\}\)) + P (\(\{\text{HTH}\}\)) + P (\(\{\text{THH}\}\)) \(\cdot\)

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{and}\text{P(F) = P (\{\text{THH}\})+\text{P (\{\text{THT}\})+P (\{\text{TTH}\})+P (\{\text{TTT}\})}}\\ \text{.}\\ \text{= \frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{2}}\end{array}\]

Also E \(\cap\) F = \(\{\text{THH}\}\)

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{with}\text{P(E \cap F) = P(\{\text{THH}\})=\frac{1}{8}}\end{array}\]

Now, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F.

Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.

Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = \(\frac{1}{4}\),

or Probability of E given that the event F has occurred = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

This probability of the event E is called the _conditional probability of E given that F has already occurred_, and is denoted by P (ElF).

Thus P(ElF) = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of E and F, i.e. the sample points of E \(\cap\) F.

Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as

\[\text{P(ElF)} =\frac{\cdot}{\text{Number of elementary events favourable to E}\cap\text{F}}\] \[\cdot\frac{\cdot}{\text{Number of elementary events which are favourable to F}}\] \[=\frac{n(\text{E}\cap\text{F})}{n(\text{F})}\]

Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events of the sample space, we see that P(ElF) can also be written as

\[\text{P(ElF)}=\frac{\cdot}{\frac{n(\text{E}\cap\text{F})}{n(\text{S})}}=\frac{ \text{P(E}\cap\text{F})}{\text{P(F)}}\]

... (1)

Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) \(\neq\) 0 i.e., F \(\neq\) 0 (Why?) Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :

**Definition 1** If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred, i.e. P (ElF) is given by

\[\text{P(ElF)}=\frac{\cdot}{\text{P(E}\cap\text{F)}}\]

 provided P(F) \(\neq\) 0

#### 13.2.1 Properties of conditional probability

Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have

**Property 1** P(SIF) = P(FIF) 1

We know that

\[\text{P(SIF)}=\frac{\cdot}{\text{P(S}\cap\text{F)}}=\frac{\text{P(F)}}{\text{ P(F)}}=1\]

Also

\[\text{P(FlF)}=\frac{\cdot}{\text{P(F}\cap\text{F)}}=\frac{\text{P(F)}}{\text{ P(F)}}=1\]

Thus

\[\text{P(SIF)}=\text{P(FlF)}=1\]

**Property 2**_If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event of S such that_ P(F) _\(\neq\) 0, then_

\[\text{P((A}\cup\text{B)|F)}=\text{P(AlF)}+\text{P(B|F)}-\text{P((A}\cap\text{ B)|F)}\]_In particular_, _if_ A _and_ B _are disjoint events, then_

\[\text{P}((\text{A}\cup\text{B})|\text{F}) = \text{P}(\text{AlF})\text{ + P}(\text{B}|\text{F})\]

We have

\[\text{P}((\text{A}\cup\text{B})|\text{F}) = \frac{\cdot\cdot\text{P}[(\text{A}\cup\text{B})\cap\text{F}]}{\text{ P}(\text{F})}\] \[= \frac{\cdot\text{P}[(\text{A}\cap\text{F})\text{ }\cup\text{ }(\text{B}\cap\text{F})]}{\text{ P}(\text{F})}\]

(by distributive law of union of sets over intersection)

\[= \frac{\cdot\text{P}(\text{A}\cap\text{F})\text{+ P}(\text{B}\cap\text{F})\text{- P}(\text{A}\cap\text{B}\text{ }\cap\text{F})}{\text{P}(\text{F})}\] \[= \frac{\cdot\text{P}(\text{A}\cap\text{F})_{\text{- P}(\text{A}\cap\text{B})}}{\text{P}(\text{F})}+\frac{\text{P}(\text{B}\cap\text{F})}{ \text{P}(\text{F})}-\frac{\text{P}[(\text{A}\cap\text{B})\text{ }\cap\text{F}]}{\text{P}(\text{F})}\] \[= \text{P}(\text{AlF})\text{ + P}(\text{B}|\text{F})\text{ - P}((\text{A}\cap\text{B})|\text{F})\]

When A and B are disjoint events, then

\[\Rightarrow \text{P}((\text{A}\cap\text{B})|\text{F})=0\]

\[\Rightarrow \text{P}((\text{A}\cup\text{B})|\text{F})=\text{P}(\text{AlF}) \text{ + P}(\text{B}|\text{F})\]

**Property 3**P(E'|F) = 1 - P(E|F)

From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1

\[\Rightarrow \text{P}(\text{E}\cup\text{E'}|\text{F})\text{ = 1}\] since S = E \[\cup\text{E'}\]

\[\Rightarrow \text{P}(\text{E}|\text{F})\text{ + P}(\text{E'}|\text{F})=1\] since E and E' are disjoint events

Thus,

\[\text{P}(\text{E'}|\text{F})=1-\text{P}(\text{E}|\text{F})\]

Let us now take up some examples.

**Example 1**: If P(A) = \(\frac{7}{13}\), P(B) = \(\frac{9}{13}\) and P(A \(\cap\text{B})\) = \(\frac{4}{13}\), evaluate P(AlB).

**Solution** We have P(AlB) = \(\frac{\text{P}(\text{A}\cap\text{B})}{\text{P}(\text{B})}\) = \(\frac{\frac{4}{13}}{9}\)

**Example 2**: A family has two children. What is the probability that both the children are boys given that at least one of them is a boy?

**Solution** Let \(b\) stand for boy and \(g\) for girl. The sample space of the experiment is

\[\text{S}=\{(b,\ b),\ (g,\ b),\ (b,\ g),\ (g,\ g)\}\]

Let E and F denote the following events :

E : 'both the children are boys'

F : 'at least one of the child is a boy'

Then E = \(\{(b,\)\(b\)\()\) and F = \(\{(b,\)\(b\)\()\), \((g,\)\(b\)\()\), \((b,\)\(g)\}\)

Now E \(\cap\) F = \(\{(b,\)\(b\)\()\)

Thus P(F) = \(\frac{3}{4}\) and P (E \(\cap\) F )= \(\frac{1}{4}\)

Therefore P(ElF) = \(\frac{\text{P(E}\cap\text{F)}}{\text{P(F)}}\) = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

**Example 3**: Ten cards numbered 1 to 10 are placed in a box; mixed up thoroughly and then one card is drawn randomly. If it is known that the number on the drawn card is more than 3, what is the probability that it is an even number?

**Solution** Let A be the event 'the number on the card drawn is even' and B be the event 'the number on the card drawn is greater than 3'. We have to find P(AlB).

Now, the sample space of the experiment is S = \(\{1,\)\(2,\)\(3,\)\(4,\)\(5,\)\(6,\)\(7,\)\(8,\)\(9,\)\(10\}\)

Then A \(\equiv\{2,\)\(4,\)\(6,\)\(8,\)\(10\}\), B = \(\{4,\)\(5,\)\(6,\)\(7,\)\(8,\)\(9,\)\(10\}\)

and A \(\cap\) B = \(\{4,\)\(6,\)\(8,\)\(10\}\)

Also P(A) = \(\frac{5}{10}\), P(B) = \(\frac{7}{10}\) and P(A \(\cap\) B) = \(\frac{4}{10}\)

Then P(AlB) = \(\frac{\text{P(A}\cap\text{B)}}{\text{P(B)}}\) = \(\frac{\frac{4}{10}}{7}\)

**Example 4** In a school, there are 1000 students, out of which 430 are girls. It is known that out of 430, 10% of the girls study in class XII. What is the probability that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII given that the chosen student is a girl?

**Solution** Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl. We have to find P (ElF).

Now \(\text{P(F)}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{430}}{1000}=0.43\text{ and }\text{P(E }\cap\text{F)}=\frac{43}{1000}=0.043\text{ (Why?)}\) Then \(\text{P(ElF)}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\text{P(E}\cap\text{F)}}}{\text{P(F)}}= \frac{0.043}{0.43}=0.1\)

**Example 5**: A die is thrown three times. Events A and B are defined as below:

A : 4 on the third throw

B : 6 on the first and 5 on the second throw

Find the probability of A given that B has already occurred.

**Solution**: The sample space has 216 outcomes.

Now \(\text{A}=\overset{\cdot}{\begin{pmatrix}(1,1,4)&(1,2,4)&...&(1,6,4)&(2,1,4)&(2,2,4)&...&(2,6,4)\\ (3,1,4)&(3,2,4)&...&(3,6,4)&(4,1,4)&(4,2,4)&...&(4,6,4)\\ (5,1,4)&(5,2,4)&...&(5,6,4)&(6,1,4)&(6,2,4)&...&(6,6,4)\end{pmatrix}}\) and \(\text{A}\cap\text{B}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\begin{pmatrix}(6,5,4)\end{pmatrix}}}{ \text{P(B)}=\frac{6}{216}}\). Now \(\text{P(B)}=\frac{6}{216}\) and \(\text{P(A}\cap\text{B)}=\frac{1}{216}\). Then \(\text{P(AlB)}=\frac{\overset{\cdot}{\text{P(A}\cap\text{B)}}}{\text{P(B)}= \frac{1}{6}}=\frac{1}{6}\).

**Example 6**: A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers appearing is observed to be 6. What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once?

**Solution**: Let E be the event that 'number 4 appears at least once' and F be the event that 'the sum of the numbers appearing is 6'.

Then, \(\text{E}=\{(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(5,4),(6,4)\}\) and \(\text{F}=\{(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)\}\) We have \(\text{P(E)}=\frac{11}{36}\text{and }\text{P(F)}=\frac{5}{36}\) Also \(\text{E}\cap\text{F}=\{(2,4),(4,2)\}\)Therefore P(E\(\cap\)F) = \(\frac{2}{36}\)

Hence, the required probability.

P(E|F) = \(\frac{\text{P(E}\cap\)F)}{\text{P(F)}}\) = \(\frac{\frac{2}{5}}{\text{36}}\) = \(\frac{2}{5}\)

For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elementary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally likely, the probabilities P(E\(\cap\)F) and P(F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up the following example.

**Example 7**: Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it again but if it shows tail, then throw a die. Find the conditional probability of the event that 'the die shows a number greater than 4' given that 'there is at least one tail'.

**Solution**: The outcomes of the experiment can be represented in following diagrammatic manner called the 'tree diagram'.

The sample space of the experiment may be described as

S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}

where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into head and (T, _i_) denote the first toss result into a tail and the number \(i\) appeared on the die for \(i\) = 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Thus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary events

\((\text{H},\text{H}),(\text{H},\text{T}),(\text{T},1),(\text{T},2),(\text{T},3) (\text{T},4),(\text{T},5),(\text{T},6)\) are \(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{12},\frac{1}{12},\frac{1}{12},\frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{12}\) respectively which is clear from the Fig 13.2.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:688]

Two coins are tossed once, where

1. \(\mathrm{E:tail\ appears\ on\ one\ coin}\), F : one coin shows head
2. \(\mathrm{E:\ no\ tail\ appears}\), F : no head appears

A die is thrown three times, E : 4 appears on the third toss, F : 6 and 5 appears respectively on first two tosses

1. A \(\subset\) B but A \(\neq\) B (B) A = B

### Multiplication Theorem on Probability

Let E and F be two events associated with a sample space S. Clearly, the set E \(\cap\) F denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E \(\cap\) F denotes the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E \(\cap\) F is also written as EF.

Very often we need to find the probability of the event EF. For example, in the experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding the probability of the event 'a king and a queen'. The probability of event EF is obtained by using the conditional probability as obtained below :

We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is denoted by P(ElF) and is given by

\[\text{P(ElF)}=\overset{\cdot}{\text{P(E\cap F)}},\text{P(F)}\neq 0\]

From this result, we can write

\[\text{P(E\cap F)}=\text{P(F)}\text{. P(ElF)}\text{. }... \tag{1}\]

Also, we know that

\[\text{P(FIE)}=\overset{\cdot}{\text{P(E\cap E)}},\text{P(E)}\neq 0\]

or

\[\text{P(FIE)}=\overset{\cdot}{\text{P(E\cap F)}}\text{. P(E)}\text{ (since E }\cap\text{F = F \cap\text{E})}\]

Thus,

\[\text{P(E\cap F)}=\text{P(E). P(FIE)}\text{ }.... \tag{2}\]

Combining (1) and (2), we find that

\[\text{P(E\cap F)}=\text{P(E) P(FIE)}\] \[=\text{P(F) P(ElF) provided P(E)}\neq 0\text{ and P(F)}\neq 0\text{.}\]

The above result is known as the _multiplication rule of probability_.

Let us now take up an example.

**Example 8**: An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn balls are black?

**Solution** Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn are black. We have to find P(E \(\cap\) F) or P(EF).

Now

\[\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{black ball in first draw}\right)=\frac{\overset{10}{15}}{15}\]

Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.

i.e.

\[\text{P}\left(\text{F}\left|\text{E}\right)=\frac{\overset{9}{14}}{14}\]

By multiplication rule of probability, we have

\[\text{P}\left(\text{E}\curvearrowright\text{F}\right) =\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{F}\left|\text{E}\right)\] \[=\frac{10}{15}\times\frac{9}{14}=\frac{3}{7}\]

_Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events_ If E, F and G are three events of sample space, we have

\[\text{P}\left(\text{E}\curvearrowright\text{F}\curvearrowright\text{G})= \text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{F}\left|\text{E}\right)\text{P }\left(\text{G}\left|\text{E}\curvearrowright\text{F}\right)\right)=\text{P} \left(\text{E}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{F}\left|\text{E}\right)\text{P}\left( \text{G}\left|\text{E}\right)\]

Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or more events.

The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability for three events.

**Example 9** Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of 52 well shuffled cards. What is, the probability that first two cards are kings and the third card drawn is an ace?

**Solution** Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)

Now

\[\text{P}\left(\text{K}\right)=\frac{\overset{4}{52}}{52}\]

Also, P (KK) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has already been drawn. Now there are three kings in \((52-1)=51\) cards.

Therefore P(KlK) = \(\frac{3}{51}\)

Lastly, P(AlKK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.

Therefore P(AlKK) = \(\frac{4}{50}\)

By multiplication law of probability, we have

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{P}\left(\text{KKA}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{K}\right) \quad\text{P}\left(\text{KIK}\right)\quad\text{P}\left(\text{AlKK}\right)\\ =\frac{4}{52}\times\frac{3}{51}\times\frac{4}{50}=\frac{2}{5525}\end{array}\]

### Independent Events

Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events 'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then

\[\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}\text{ and P}\left(\text{F}\right)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}\]

Also E and F is the event'the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that

\[\text{P}\left(\text{E}\cap\text{F}\right)=\frac{1}{4}\text{ and }\text{P}\left(\text{F} \right)=\frac{52}{13}=\frac{1}{4}\]

Hence P(EIF) = \(\frac{1}{4}=\text{P}\left(\text{EIF}\right)\), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event E.

We also have

\[\text{P}\left(\text{FIE}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{E}\cap\text{F} \right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)}=\frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{1}{4}}= \frac{1}{13}=\text{P}\left(\text{F}\right)\]

Again, P(F) = \(\frac{1}{13}=\text{P}\left(\text{FIE}\right)\) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event F.

Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of them is not affected by occurrence of the other.

Such events are called _independent events_.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:693]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:694]

and

\[G =\{HHT,HTH,THH,HT,THT,TTH,TTT\}\]

Also

\[E\cap F =\{HHH\},\ E\cap G=\{TTT\},\ F\cap G=\{HHT,HTH,THH\}\]

Therefore

\[P(E) =\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{4},\ P(F)=\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2},\ P(G)=\frac{7}{8}\]

and

\[P(E\cap F) =\frac{1}{8},\ P(E\cap G)=\frac{1}{8},\ P(F\cap G)=\frac{3}{8}\]

Also

\[P(E)\.\ P(F) =\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{8},\ P(E)\cdot P(G)=\frac{1} {4}\times\frac{7}{8}=\frac{7}{32}\]

and

\[P(F)\.\ P(G) =\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{7}{8}=\frac{7}{16}\]

Thus

\[P(E\cap F) =P(E)\.\ P(F)\]

\[P(E\cap G) \neq P(E)\.\ P(G)\]

and

\[P(F\cap G) \neq P(F)\.\ P(G)\]

Hence, the events (E and F) are independent, and the events (E and G) and (F and G) are dependent.

Example 13: Prove that if E and F are independent events, then so are the events E and F\({}^{\prime}\).

SolutionSince E and F are independent, we have

\[P(E\cap F)=P(E)\.\ P(F)\]

....(1)

From the venn diagram in Fig 13.3, it is clear that E \(\cap F\) and E \(\cap F\)' are mutually exclusive events and also E =(E \(\cap F\)) \(\cup\) (E \(\cap F\)').

Therefore

\[P(E) =P(E\cap F)+P(E\cap F^{\prime})\]

or

\[P(E\cap F^{\prime}) =P(E)-P(E\cap F)\]

\[=P(E)-P(E)\.\ P(F)\]

\[(by\ (1))\]

\[=P(E)\ (1-P(F))\]

\[=P(E)\.\ P(F^{\prime})\]

Hence, E and F' are independent

### Bayes' Theorem

Consider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. \(\frac{1}{2}\)) or probability of drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an event occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed by him is known as _'Bayes theorem'_ which was published posthumously in 1763. Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and some preliminary results.

#### Partition of a sample space

A set of events \(\mathrm{E}_{1}\), \(\mathrm{E}_{2}\),..., \(\mathrm{E}_{n}\) is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if

1. \(\mathrm{E}_{i}\cap\mathrm{E}_{j}=\phi\), \(i\neq j\), \(i,j=1\), 2, 3,..., \(n\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:699]

Therefore,

P (A) = P (E\({}_{1}\)) P (AlE\({}_{1}\)) + P (E\({}_{2}\)) P (AlE\({}_{2}\)) +... + P (E\({}_{n}\))P(AlE\({}_{n}\))

or

P(A) = \(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}\)P(E\({}_{j}\))P(AlE\({}_{j}\))

**Example 15** A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65 that there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a strike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.

**Solution** Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B be the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).

We have

P(B) = 0.65, P(no strike) = P(B\({}^{\prime}\)) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35

P(AlB) = 0.32, P(AlB') = 0.80

Since events B and B\({}^{\prime}\) form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem on total probability, we have

P(A) = P(B) P(AlB) + P(B\({}^{\prime}\))P(AlB')

= 0.65 \(\times\) 0.32 + 0.35 \(\times\) 0.8

= 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488

Thus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488.

We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem.

**Bayes' Theorem** If E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),..., E\({}_{n}\) are \(n\) non empty events which constitute a partition of sample space S, i.e. E\({}_{1}\), E\({}_{2}\),..., E\({}_{n}\) are pairwise disjoint and E\({}_{1}\)\(\cup\) E\({}_{2}\)\(\cup\)... \(\cup\) E\({}_{n}\) = S and A is any event of nonzero probability, then

\[\text{P(E}_{i}\text{A)}=\frac{\cdot\,\,\text{P(E}_{i}\text{)}\,\text{P(A} \text{|E}_{i})}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}\text{P(E}_{j}\text{)}\,\text{P(AlE}_{j })}\quad\text{for any $i=1$, 2$, 3$,..., $n$}\]

Proof By formula of conditional probability, we know that

P(E\({}_{i}\text{A)}=\frac{\text{P(A}\cap\text{E}_{i}\text{)}}{\text{P(A)}}\)

= \(\frac{\text{P(E}_{i}\text{)}\,\text{P(AlE}_{i})}{\text{P(A)}}\) (by multiplication rule of probability)

= \(\frac{\text{P(E}_{i}\text{)}\,\text{P(AlE}_{i})}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \text{P(E}_{j}\text{)P(AlE}_{j})}\) (by the result of theorem of total probability)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:701]

**Solution** Let \(\text{E}_{1}\), \(\text{E}_{2}\) and \(\text{E}_{3}\) be the events that boxes I, II and III are chosen, respectively.

Then \(\text{P}(\text{E}_{1})=\text{P}(\text{E}_{2})=\text{P}(\text{E}_{3})=\frac{1}{3}\)

Also, let A be the event that 'the coin drawn is of gold'

Then \(\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{1})=\text{P}(\text{a gold coin from bag I})=\frac{2}{2}=1\)

\(\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{2})=\text{P}(\text{a gold coin from bag II})=0\)

\(\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{3})=\text{P}(\text{a gold coin from bag III})=\frac{1}{2}\)

Now, the probability that the other coin in the box is of gold

= the probability that gold coin is drawn from the box I

= P(\(\text{E}_{1}\)\(\text{A}\))

By Bayes' theorem, we know that

\(\text{P}(\text{E}_{1}\)\(\text{A}\)) = \(\frac{\text{P}(\text{E}_{1})\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{1})}{\text{P}(\text{E}_{1}) \text{P}(\text{AlE}_{1})+\text{P}(\text{E}_{2})\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{2})+\text {P}(\text{E}_{3})\text{P}(\text{AlE}_{3})}\)

**Example 18** Suppose that the reliability of a HIV test is specified as follows:

Of people having HIV, 90% of the test detect the disease but 10% go undetected. Of people free of HIV, 99% of the test are judged HIV-ive but 1% are diagnosed as showing HIV+ive. From a large population of which only 0.1% have HIV, one person is selected at random, given the HIV test, and the pathologist reports him/her as HIV+ive. What is the probability that the person actually has HIV?

**Solution** Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive. We need to find P(ElA).

Also \(\text{E}^{\prime}\) denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV.

Clearly, \(\{\text{E},\text{E}^{\prime}\}\) is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population. We are given that

\(\text{P}(\text{E})=0.1\%=\frac{0.1}{100}=0.001\)\[\begin{array}{lcl}\text{P(E'}&=&1-\text{P(E)}=0.999\\ \text{P(AIE)}&=&\text{P(Person tested as HIV+ive given that he/she}\\ &\text{is actually having HIV)}\\ &\text{.}\\ &=&90\%=\frac{90}{100}\text{=}0.9\\ \end{array}\]

and \[\begin{array}{lcl}\text{P(AIE'}&=&\text{P(Person tested as HIV +ive given that he/she}\\ &\text{is actually not having HIV)}\\ &\text{.}\\ &=&1\%=\frac{1}{100}\text{=}0.01\\ \end{array}\]

Now, by Bayes' theorem

\[\begin{array}{lcl}\text{P(EIA)}&=&\frac{\text{P(E)P(AIE)}}{\text{P(E)P(AIE)+P(E ')P(AIE')}}\\ &\text{.}\\ &=&\frac{0.001\times 0.9}{0.001\times 0.9+0.999\times 0.01}\\ &=&0.083\text{ approx.}\\ \end{array}\]

Thus, the probability that a person selected at random is actually having HIV given that he/she is tested HIV+ive is 0.083.

**Example 19**: In a factory which manufactures bolts, machines A, B and C manufacture respectively 25%, 35% and 40% of the bolts. Of their outputs, 5, 4 and 2 percent are respectively defective bolts. A bolt is drawn at random from the product and is found to be defective. What is the probability that it is manufactured by the machine B?

**Solution** Let events \(\text{B}_{1}\), \(\text{B}_{2}\), \(\text{B}_{3}\) be the following :

\[\begin{array}{lcl}\text{B}_{1}&:&\text{the bolt is manufactured by machine A}\\ \text{B}_{2}&:&\text{the bolt is manufactured by machine B}\\ \text{B}_{3}&:&\text{the bolt is manufactured by machine C}\\ \end{array}\]

Clearly, \(\text{B}_{1}\), \(\text{B}_{2}\), \(\text{B}_{3}\) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and hence, they represent a partition of the sample space.

Let the event E be 'the bolt is defective'.

The event E occurs with \(\text{B}_{1}\) or with \(\text{B}_{2}\) or with \(\text{B}_{3}\). Given that,

\[\text{P(B}_{1})=25\%=0.25,\ \text{P (B}_{2})=0.35\text{ and P(B}_{3})=0.40\]

Again \(\text{P(EIB}_{1})=\text{Probability that the bolt drawn is defective given that it is manufactured by machine A = 5% = 0.05

Similarly, \(\text{P(EIB}_{2})=0.04,\ \text{P(EIB}_{3})=0.02\).

Hence, by Bayes' Theorem, we have

\[\text{P(B}_{2}|\text{E}) = \frac{\text{P(B}_{2})\,\text{P(ElB}_{2})}{\text{P(B}_{1})\,\text{P(ElB }_{1})\,\text{P(ElB}_{2})\,\text{P(ElB}_{2})\,\text{+P(B}_{3})\,\text{P(ElB}_{ 3})}\] \[= \frac{0.35\times 0.04}{0.25\times 0.05+0.35\times 0.04+0.40\times 0.02}\] \[= \frac{\text{0.0140}}{0.0345}\,\text{=}\,\frac{28}{69}\]

**Example 20**: A doctor is to visit a patient. From the past experience, it is known that the probabilities that he will come by train, bus, scooter or by other means of transport are respectively \(\frac{3}{10},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{10}\)and \(\frac{2}{5}\). The probabilities that he will be late are \(\frac{1}{4}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\), and \(\frac{1}{12}\), if he comes by train, bus and scooter respectively, but if he comes by other means of transport, then he will not be late. When he arrives, he is late. What is the probability that he comes by train?

**Solution** Let E be the event that the doctor visits the patient late and let T\({}_{1}\), T\({}_{2}\), T\({}_{3}\), T\({}_{4}\) be the events that the doctor comes by train, bus, scooter, and other means of transport respectively.

Then

\[\text{P(T}_{1}) = \frac{3}{10},\text{P(T}_{2})\,\text{=}\,\frac{1}{5},\text{P(T}_{3 })\,\text{=}\,\frac{1}{10}\,\text{and}\,\text{P(T}_{4})\,\text{=}\,\frac{2}{5}\] (given) \[\text{P(ElT}_{1}) = \text{Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train}=\frac{1}{4}\]

Similarly, \(\text{P(ElT}_{2})\,\text{=}\,\frac{1}{3}\), \(\text{P(ElT}_{3})\,\text{=}\,\frac{1}{12}\) and \(\text{P(ElT}_{4})\,\text{=}\,0\), since he is not late if he comes by other means of transport.

Therefore, by Bayes' Theorem, we have

\[\text{P(T}_{1}|\text{E}) = \text{Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train}\] \[= \frac{\frac{3}{10}\times\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{10}\times\frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{5}\times\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{10}\times\frac{1}{12}+\frac{2}{5} \times 0}=\frac{3}{40}\times\frac{120}{18}\,\text{=}\,\frac{1}{2}\]

Hence, the required probability is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

**Example 21**: A man is known to speak truth 3 out of 4 times. He throws a die and reports that it is a six. Find the probability that it is actually a six.

**Solution** Let E be the event that the man reports that six occurs in the throwing of the die and let S\({}_{1}\) be the event that six occurs and S\({}_{2}\) be the event that six does not occur.

Then P(S\({}_{1}\)) = Probability that _six_ occurs = \(\frac{1}{6}\)

P(S\({}_{2}\)) = Probability that _six_ does not occur = \(\frac{5}{6}\)

P(ElS\({}_{1}\)) = Probability that the man reports that _six_ occurs when _six_ has actually occurred on the die

P(ElS\({}_{2}\)) = Probability that the man reports that _six_ occurs when _six_ has not actually occurred on the die

P(S\({}_{1}\)E) = Probability that the man does not speak the man that _six_ has occurred is actually a _six_

P(S\({}_{1}\)E) = Probability that the report of the man that _six_ has occurred is actually a _six_

P(S\({}_{1}\)P(ElS\({}_{1}\))P(ElS\({}_{1}\))P(ElS\({}_{2}\))P(ElS\({}_{2}\))

Hence, the required probability is \(\frac{3}{8}\).

_Remark_: A random variable is a real valued function whose domain is the sample space of a random experiment.

For example, let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times in succession. The sample space of the experiment is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

If X denotes the number of heads obtained, then X is a random variable and for each outcome, its value is as given below :

\[\text{X(HH)}=2,\text{ X (HT)}=1,\text{ X (TH)}=1,\text{ X (TT)}=0.\]

More than one random variables can be defined on the same sample space. For example, let Y denote the number of heads minus the number of tails for each outcome of the above sample space S.

Then Y(HH) = 2, Y (HT) = 0, Y (TH) = 0, Y (TT) = - 2.

Thus, X and Y are two different random variables defined on the same sample space S.

**Example 23** A and B throw a die alternatively till one of them gets a '6' and wins the game. Find their respective probabilities of winning, if A starts first.

**Solution** Let S denote the success (getting a '6') and F denote the failure (not getting a '6').

Thus,

P(S) = \(\frac{1}{6}\), P(F)=\(\frac{5}{6}\)

P(A wins in the first throw) = P(S) = \(\frac{1}{6}\)

A gets the third throw, when the first throw by A and second throw by B result into failures.

Therefore, P(A wins in the 3rd throw) = P(FFFS) = P(F) P(F) P(S) = \(\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}\)

P(A wins in the 5th throw) = P(FFFS) = \(\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\)and so on.

Hence, P(A wins) = \(\frac{1}{6}\)+\(\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)+\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\)+...

P(B wins) = 1 - P (A wins) = 1 - \(\frac{6}{11}\)=\(\frac{5}{11}\)

**Example 24**: If a machine is correctly set up, it produces 90% acceptable items. If it is incorrectly set up, it produces only 40% acceptable items. Past experience shows that 80% of the set ups are correctly done. If after a certain set up, the machine produces 2 acceptable items, find the probability that the machine is correctly setup.

**Solution** Let A be the event that the machine produces 2 acceptable items.

Also let \(\text{B}_{{}_{1}}\) represent the event of correct set up and \(\text{B}_{{}_{2}}\) represent the event of incorrect setup.

Now

\[\text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{1}}) =0.8,\text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{2}})=0.2\] \[\text{P}(\text{Al}\text{B}_{{}_{1}}) =0.9\times 0.9\text{\ \ and\ }\text{P}(\text{Al}\text{B}_{{}_{2}})= 0.4\times 0.4\] \[\cdot\] Therefore

\[\text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{1}}|\text{A}) =\frac{\text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{1}})\,\text{P}(\text{Al}\text{B}_{{} _{1}})}{\text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{1}})\,\text{P}(\text{Al}\text{B}_{{}_{1}})+ \text{P}(\text{B}_{{}_{2}})\,\text{P}(\text{Al}\text{B}_{{}_{2}})}\] \[\cdot\] \[=\frac{0.8\times 0.9\times 0.9}{0.8\times 0.9\times 0.9+0.2\times 0.4 \times 0.4}=0.95\]

### Historical Note

The earliest indication on measurement of chances in game of dice appeared in 1477 in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy. A treatise on gambling named _liber de Ludo Alcae_, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases for each event when two dice are thrown.

Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation of chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9, because the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of cases for the appearance of number 9.

Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two great men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the observation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654, Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.

Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first book on probability, "_De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae_" containing solution of many interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.

The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), in the form of a great book, "_Ars Conjectendi_" published posthumously in 1713 by his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next remarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, 'Foundations of probability' published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is considered a 'classic!'.
